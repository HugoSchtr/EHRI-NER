It O
would O
seem O
, O
from O
all O
indications O

that O
the O
intent O
is O
to O
obtain O
a O
large O
group O
of O
workers O

use O

What O
this O
use O
is O
seems O
to O
be O
problematical O

it O
may O
well O
be O
to O
prepare O

the O

, O
of O
these O

It O
would O
seem O
that O
this O
movement O
may O
well O
be O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
movement O
of O
populations O
which O
the O
German O
authorities O
are O
carrying O
out O

the O
bringing O
back O

and O
those O

There O
are O
many O
rumors O
, O
but O
to O
date O
unverified O
, O
that O
the O
German O
authorities O
intend O
to O
bring O
into O

many O
of O
the O
Germans O

If O
these O
rumors O
are O
warranted O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
the O
plan O
to O
replace O
some O
of O

must O
be O

together O

the O

decree O
instituting O

In O

these O

Having O
thus O
determined O
the O
legal O
status O
of O
persons O
belonging O
to O
the O
Jewish O
race O
, O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
settle O
all O
attendant O
economic O
matters O

A O
first O
step O
was O
therefore O
to O
declare O
null O
and O
void O
all O
contracts O
entered O
into O
between O
Jews O
and O
between O
Jews O
and O
others O
in O
the O
60 O
days O
preceding O
the O
declaration O
of O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia B-LOC

if O
the O
value O
of O
the O
contract O
was O
over O
100,000 O
Dinars O

if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
subsequently O
approved O
by O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Justice O

Almost O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
law O
- O
decree O
was O
issued O
whereby O
all O
businesses O

entirely O

partially O
owned O
by O
Jews O

That O

decree O
ordered O
Jews O

persons O

Aryan O
origin O
joined O
in O
matrimony O
with O

foreign O

were O

all O

occurred O
after O
10th B-DATE
February I-DATE

With O
this O
decree O
any O
alienation O
of O
Jewish O
property O
, O
as O

the O
transfer O
of O
Jewish O
businesses O

of O
stocks O

of O

in O
consortia O
and O
other O
property O
rights O
was O
made O
impossible O

since O
any O
contract O
of O
whatever O
kind O
required O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
. O

Jewish O
businesses O
thus O
confiscated O
by O
the O
State O
might O
be O
managed O
by O
the O
State O
itself O
, O
or O
be O
either O
leased O

sold O
or O
liquidated O
in O
favour O
of O

The O
final O
decision O
in O
all O
these O
cases O
lies O
with O
the O
Ministry B-ORG

Lastly O
, O
with O
the O
Decree O
of O
10th B-DATE
October I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
authority O
on O
all O
matters O
concerning O
the O
estates O
of O
individual O
Jews O
or O
of O
Jewish O
businesses O
has O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
which O
may O
, O
with O
a O
discretionary O
decision O
that O
admits O
no O
recourse O
, O
nationalize O
the O
assets O
of O
any O
Jew O
as O
well O
as O
of O
any O
Jewish O
business O
and O
determine O
what O
compensation O
, O
if O
any O
, O
shall O
be O
paid O
and O
how O
. O

The O
estates O
thus O
acquired O
can O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
or O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
. O

Recently O
this O
Department O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
have O
been O
eliminated O
and O
all O
authority O
in O
matters O
concerning O
Jewish O
economic O
questions O
and O
the O
assessment O
of O
race O
has O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
Office O
for O
Nationalized O
Assets O
, O
and O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
Affairs O
respectively O
. O

The O
implementation O
of O
all O
these O
measures O
has O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
been O
very O
easy O
. O

Croatian O
public O
opinion O
, O
being O
insufficiently O
prepared O
for O
a O
racial O
campaign O
and O
still O
wary O
of O
the O
new O
Regime O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
shaken O
by O
a O
string O
of O
illegal O
acts O
carried O
out O
by O
unscrupulous O
Ustashe O
officials O
, O
had O
a O
rather O
negative O
reaction O
against O
these O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
and O
watched O
the O
course O
of O
events O
with O
great O
scepticism O
. O

From O
a O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
, O
which O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
the O
buttress O
of O
the O
entire O
system O
, O
and O
whose O
task O
it O
was O
basically O
to O
centralize O
and O
draw O
up O
an O
inventory O
of O
all O
Jewish O
property O
, O
proved O
decidedly O
inferior O
to O
the O
task O
they O
had O
been O
entrusted O
with O
, O
both O
because O
their O
offices O
were O
disorganized O
and O
because O
its O
officials O
had O
absolutely O
no O
experience O
in O
such O
matters O
. O

This O
state O
of O
affairs O
was O
taken O
advantage O
of O
by O
elements O
of O
the O
German O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
who O
, O
through O
their O
financial O
organizations O
, O
were O
able O
to O
acquire O
legally O
the O
main O
formerly O
Jewish O
businesses O
. O

Lastly O
, O
as O
to O
the O
present O
situation O
of O
Croats O
who O
own O
formerly O
Jewish O
property O
, O
it O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
they O
have O
acquired O
it O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
but O
mainly O
through O
a O
system O
of O
fictitious O
sales O
carried O
out O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
persons O
appointed O
by O
the O
State O
to O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
said O
property O
. O

Of O
the O
40,000 O
Jews O
who O
, O
it O
has O
been O
estimated O
, O
were O
living O
in O
Croatian O
territory O
, O
only O
approx O
. O

6,000 O
are O
left O
, O
almost O
all O
interned O
in O
concentration O
camps O
or O
assigned O
to O
farm O
work O
or O
to O
land O
reclamation O
. O

Of O
the O
rest O
, O
some O
have O
managed O
to O
emigrate O
and O
some O
must O
be O
considered O
missing O
. O

The O
Jewish O
problem O
can O
therefore O
be O
considered O
virtually O
solved O
in O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
; O
a O
few O
issues O
still O
remain O
pending O
, O
such O
for O
instance O
as O
mixed O
marriages O
, O
but O
they O
too O
will O
soon O
be O
dealt O
with O
and O
settled O

, O
indicate O
that O
this O
law O
is O
being O
rigorously O
enforced O
. O

Previous O
reports O
that O
there O
was O
some O
lenity O
in O
the O
enforcement O
of O
the O
law O
applied O
only O
to O
a O
small O
number O
of O
Christian O
Jews O
with O
regard O
to O
wearing O
the O
Star O
of O
David O
. O

Also O
some O
postponement O
was O
found O
necessary O
due O
to O
the O
physical O
impossibility O
of O
moving O
so O
many O
Jews O
into O
the O
ghetto O
or O
deporting O
them O
at O
one O
time O
. O

A O
prominent O
Jewish O
surgeon O
arrived O
in O
Istanbul B-LOC
from O
Sofia B-LOC
on O
November B-DATE
12 I-DATE
after O
having O
been O
deprived O
of O
his O
right O
to O
practice O
his O
profession O
. O

He O
owned O
and O
operated O
a O
hospital O
and O
clinic O
, O
which O
is O
forbidden O
to O
Jews O
in O
accordance O
with O
Article O
33 O
of O
the O
Law O
. O

All O
his O
property O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
him O
. O

Actually O
this O
man O
is O
a O
Catholic O
and O
has O
been O
such O
for O
thirty O
- O
five O
years O
. O

He O
declared O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
severe O
treatment O
is O
the O
jealousy O
of O
Bulgarian O
surgeons O
and O
doctors O
who O
take O
this O
means O
of O
ridding O
themselves O
of O
competition O
. O

As O
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
several O
thousand O
Jews O
are O
now O
in O
the O
process O
of O
being O
deported O
from O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

Where O
they O
will O
be O
sent O
is O
not O
known O
. O

They O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
deported O
to O
towns O
and O
villages O
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC
but O
some O
high O
placed O
persons O
believe O
many O
of O
them O
will O
be O
deported O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Some O
think O
they O
will O
be O
put O
in O
concentration O
camps O
inside O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
where O
many O
will O
eventually O
die O
of O
disease O
and O
starvation O
. O

Others O
, O
including O
the O
surgeon O
referred O
to O
above O
, O
think O
that O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
them O
will O
be O
shot O
, O
as O
they O
have O
been O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC

other O
cities O

In O
any O

the O
content O

the O
law O
, O
together O
with O
the O
severity O
with O
which O
it O

All O

each O

us O
was O
happy O

Many O

went O
with O
us O

When O
we O
approached O
Dresden B-LOC

we O
prepared O
to O
disembark O

How O
great O
was O
our O
disappointment O
when O
we O
rode O
through O
Dresden B-LOC
without O
stopping O
and O
saw O
that O
we O
were O
going O
east O

Instead O
of O
riding O
for O
an O
hour O

we O
rode O
for O
twenty O
- O
four O
until O
we O
reached O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
train O
station O

Here O
, O
we O
had O
to O
get O
off O
the O
train O
without O
our O
luggage O

the O
selection O

took O
place O
right O

the O

on O
the O

us O
childless O

on O
the O

At O
the O
time O
, O
we O
still O
didn’t O
know O
what O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
right O
meant O
( O
the O
gas O
chamber O

We O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
washrooms O
, O
where O
everything O
we O
had O
on O
was O
taken O
away O
, O
our O
heads O
were O
shaved O
, O
we O
were O
led O
to O
the O
showers O

and O
clothed O
in O
old O
rags O

And O
then O
the O
familiar O
, O
nerve O

wrenching O
life O
in O
the O
concentration O
camp O
began O
. O

After O
5 O
days O
, O
we O
went O
through O
another O
selection O
and O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
train O
. O

We O
were O
given O
better O
clothing O
and O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
Germany B-LOC

We O
rode O
until O
we O
reached O
the O
Schlesiersee B-LOC
train O
station O
in O
northeast O
Silesia B-LOC
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
Polish B-LOC
border O
. O

From O
the O
station O
we O
walked O
for O
about O
2 O
hours O
. O

They O
put O
us O
up O
in O
two O
farms O
, O
1,000 O
women O
in O
each O
building O
. O

They O
housed O
us O
in O
two O
large O
barns O
for O
storing O
hay O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
given O
shovels O
and O
spades O
and O
we O
dug O
3 O
½ O
meters O
deep O
anti O
- O
tank O
trenches O
. O

It O
was O
extremely O
hard O
work O
for O
us O
women O
and O
there O
was O
very O
little O
food O
, O
and O
so O
we O
quickly O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
weight O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
October B-DATE
, O
one O
of O
the O
girls O
bumped O
into O
my O
leg O
with O
a O
wheelbarrow O
. O

I O
had O
a O
small O
scrape O
that O
I O
didn’t O
think O
was O
serious O
. O

Several O
days O
later O
, O
my O
leg O
started O
hurting O
, O
swelled O
up O
, O
and O
developed O
a O
small O
phlegmon O
. O

It O
gradually O
got O
worse O
and O
the O
doctor O
had O
to O
operate O
on O
me O
in O
the O
barn O
. O

After O
the O
incision O
, O
my O
high O
fever O
came O
down O
, O
but O
I O
couldn’t O
stand O
on O
my O
leg O
, O
and O
so O
for O
three O
weeks O
I O
crawled O
around O
on O
all O
fours O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
better O
, O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
perform O
domestic O
labor O
. O

I O
peeled O
potatoes O
. O

I O
would O
get O
up O
at O
4 O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
peeled O
potatoes O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
I O
developed O
a O
fever O
of O
40 O
degrees O
, O
shooting O
pain O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
my O
chest O
, O
and O
I O
started O
coughing O
. O

The O
doctor O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
pneumonia O
. O

Since O
wrapping O
my O
chest O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
in O
the O
cold O
barn O
and O
there O
was O
no O
medicine O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
I O
was O
left O
to O
my O
own O
fate O
. O

I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
lie O
down O
, O
and O
so O
I O
sat O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
icy O
wall O
of O
the O
stable O
wearing O
only O
my O
clothes O
( O
coats O
and O
shoes O
were O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
sick O
and O
given O
to O
the O
healthy O
) O
. O

I O
was O
covered O
with O
a O
camp O
- O
issued O
blanket O
. O

Ten O
days O
later O
, O
my O
pneumonia O
disappeared O
as O
if O
by O
a O
miracle O
, O
but O
the O
injury O
on O
my O
leg O
got O
worse O
and O
started O
to O
fester O
. O

Around O
January B-DATE
10th I-DATE
, O
the O
sick O
were O
moved O
into O
quickly O
built O
wooden O
barracks O
. O

Before O
we O
moved O
, O
we O
had O
to O
hand O
over O
everything O
we O
wore O
and O
wash O
ourselves O
so O
that O
we O
wouldn’t O
bring O
lice O
, O
which O
we O
were O
completely O
infested O
with O
, O
into O
the O
new O
building O
. O

We O
entered O
the O
building O
completely O
naked O
and O
they O
promised O
to O
disinfect O
our O
clothes O
and O
give O
them O
back O
to O
us O
. O

Washing O
, O
however O
, O
didn’t O
rid O
us O
of O
lice O
. O

Our O
situation O
was O
much O
improved O
in O
the O
barracks O
. O

We O
slept O
in O
bunk O
beds O
on O
straw O
mattresses O
, O
two O
to O
a O
bed O
and O
covered O
by O
a O
single O
blanket O
. O

We O
were O
so O
cold O
. O

On O
January B-DATE
22nd I-DATE
, O
we O
heard O
that O
the O
battlefront O
was O
only O
20 O
km O

us O
. O

There O
were O
rumors O
that O
we O
would O
be O
evacuated O

Sick O

were O

remain O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
and O
hoped O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
would O
liberate O
us O
soon O
. O

But O
we O
rejoiced O
too O
soon O
. O

At O
about O
7 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
a O
German B-LOC
commander O
entered O
and O
ordered O
everyone O
to O
evacuate O
, O
including O
the O
seriously O
ill O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
desperate O
, O
because O
all O
of O
us O
were O
lying O
in O
bed O
completely O
naked O
. O

We O
started O
to O
panic O
and O
each O
of O
us O
tried O
to O
find O
something O
to O
wear O
. O

I O
begged O
our O
superior O
for O
some O
clothes O
, O
but O
it O
was O
all O
in O
vain O
. O

At O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
one O
of O
the O
nurses O
gave O
me O
a O
summer O
dress O
that O
I O
threw O
over O
my O
naked O
body O
. O

I O
wound O
strips O
ripped O
from O
a O
blanket O
around O
my O
legs O
, O
even O
though O
this O
was O
sabotage O
, O
and O
I O
managed O
to O
snag O
2 O
blankets O
. O

I O
tied O
one O
around O
my O
waist O
like O
a O
skirt O
, O
and O
wrapped O
the O
other O
around O
my O
shoulders O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
pair O
of O
clogs O
. O

Many O
women O
were O
barefoot O
and O
their O
feet O
became O
frostbitten O
. O

When O
we O
walked O
out O
into O
the O
courtyard O
we O
could O
barely O
stand O
up O
. O

It O
was O
freezing O
and O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
snow O
. O

For O
our O
journey O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
last O
us O
three O
days O
. O

Then O
they O
filled O
us O
into O
lines O
of O
5 O
and O
the O
march O
began O
. O

I O
wasn’t O
able O
to O
walk O
because O
I O
had O
been O
sick O
in O
bed O
for O
almost O
10 O
weeks O
, O
but O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
kept O
forcing O
me O
and O
threatening O
to O
shoot O
me O
. O

And O
so O
we O
marched O
all O
night O
until O
the O
afternoon O
of O
the O
next O
day O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
many O
of O
us O
died O
or O
froze O
to O
death O
. O

At O
3 O
o’clock O
the O
next O
day O
we O
came O
to O
a O
forest O
that O
was O
about O
4 O
km O
before O
Ostweide B-LOC
. O

The O
commander O
ordered O
all O
of O
the O
sick O
to O
sit O
down O
. O

A O
vehicle O
would O
be O
coming O
from O
Ostweide B-LOC
to O
pick O
them O
up O
soon O
. O

The O
healthy O
continued O
marching O
. O

I O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
forest O
by O
a O
ditch O
and O
was O
happy O
that O
I O
didn’t O
have O
to O
keep O
going O
. O

I O
believed O
that O
the O
vehicle O
would O
arrive O
, O
although O
others O
claimed O
that O
something O
else O
would O
happen O
. O

There O
were O
about O
40 O
of O
us O
here O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
doctor O
, O
who O
took O
down O
our O
names O
. O

There O
were O
also O
2 O
corpses O
. O

About O
60 O
m O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
forest O
, O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
were O
digging O
a O
hole O
. O

I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
for O
our O
2 O
corpses O
. O

When O
it O
got O
dark O
and O
we O
had O
given O
up O
all O
hope O
that O
the O
vehicle O
would O
come O
, O
2 O
Schupo B-ORG
came O
up O
to O
us O
, O
grabbed O
about O
six O
women O
and O
forced O
them O
toward O
the O
hole O
, O
shouting O
arbeiten O
– O
arbeiten O
. O

The O
women O
screamed O
and O
wanted O
to O
escape O
, O
but O
then O
we O
heard O
shots O
and O
then O
silence O
. O

Now O
we O
knew O
for O
sure O
that O
there O
was O
no O
vehicle O
and O
what O
truly O
awaited O
us O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
came O
for O
the O
next O
6 O
victims O
. O

I O
was O
part O
of O
the O
3rd O
group O
. O

I O
was O
reconciled O
with O
my O
fate O
and O
was O
absolutely O
calm O
. O

A O
Schupo B-ORG
came O
up O
to O
me O
, O
grabbed O
me O
by O
the O
shoulder O
, O
and O
shouted O
: O
Komm O
. O

I O
said O
to O
him O
: O
Just O
a O
moment O
, O
I’ll O
just O
give O
my O
bread O
and O
blanket O
to O
the O
doctor O
to O
hand O
out O
to O
the O
others O
since O
I O
won’t O
be O
needing O
them O
anymore O
. O

He O
answered O
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
was O
totally O
calm O
: O
You O
may O
. O

And O
so O
I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
thanked O
her O
for O
her O
work O
and O
for O
treating O
me O
and O
gave O
her O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
bread O
and O
the O
blanket O
. O

I O
then O
walked O
peacefully O
with O
my O
murderer O
up O
to O
the O
hole O
. O

About O
13 O
corpses O
lay O
in O
it O
. O

He O
made O
several O
women O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
mound O
of O
earth O
dug O
from O
the O
hole O
, O
and O
ordered O
me O
and O
two O
other O
women O
to O
turn O
our O
backs O
to O
him O
. O

First O
, O
he O
shot O
the O
women O
by O
the O
hole O
and O
then O
it O
was O
our O
turn O
. O

I O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
moonlit O
night O
. O

I O
gazed O
up O
at O
the O
moon O
and O
thought O
to O
myself O
: O
what O
a O
pity O
that O
I O
have O
to O
die O
and O
nobody O
will O
ever O
know O
what O
happened O
here O
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
moment O
that O
I O
finally O
understood O
how O
beautiful O
it O
is O
to O
be O
alive O
, O
even O
after O
all O
that O
we’d O
been O
through O
. O

And O
then O
a O
shot O
rang O
out O
and O
the O
woman O
to O
my O
right O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

And O
then O
a O
second O
shot O
and O
I O
felt O
a O
sharp O
pain O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
my O
neck O
. O

I O
collapsed O
onto O
the O
ground O
, O
but O
never O
lost O
consciousness O
. O

It O
felt O
strange O
to O
not O
be O
dead O
yet O
, O
but O
waiting O
for O
death O
. O

I O
soon O
realized O
that O
the O
shot O
had O
not O
been O
fatal O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
blood O
flowing O
from O
my O
wound O
and O
I O
quickly O
placed O
a O
hand O
on O
my O
neck O
. O

It O
all O
happened O
within O
an O
instant O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
woman O
on O
my O
left O
side O
was O
shot O
. O

I O
began O
to O
be O
afraid O
that O
I O
would O
be O
buried O
alive O
. O

I O
heard O
the O
conversation O
between O
two O
of O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
who O
had O
shot O
us O
and O
were O
now O
standing O
right O
behind O
me O
. O

They O
had O
a O
very O
interesting O
conversation O
. O

One O
wanted O
to O
throw O
us O
into O
the O
hole O
right O
away O
, O
and O
the O
second O
said O
that O
they O
needed O
to O
wait O
until O
all O
of O
us O
were O
dead O
, O
and O
then O
the O
doctor O
would O
strip O
us O
and O
throw O
us O
into O
the O
hole O
. O

The O
seriously O
ill O
ones O
, O
who O
were O
brought O
here O
on O
wheelbarrows O
, O
those O
we’ll O
beat O
to O
death O
with O
our O
rifle O
butts O
, O
said O
one O
of O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
. O

When O
their O
conversation O
was O
over O
, O
they O
walked O
away O
from O
the O
hole O
to O
bring O
more O
victims O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
forest O
. O

Without O
thinking O
, O
I O
turned O
over O
and O
crawled O
away O
into O
the O
forest O
on O
all O
fours O
. O

I O
thought O
to O
myself O
that O
it O
’s O
better O
if O
they O
shoot O
me O
again O
if O
they O
find O
me O
than O
to O
be O
buried O
alive O
. O

The O
night O
was O
clear O
and O
we O
were O
in O
a O
forest O
with O
tall O
trees O
, O
and O
so O
there O
was O
nowhere O
for O
me O
to O
hide O
. O

I O
crawled O
a O
couple O
meters O
away O
from O
the O
hole O
and O
hid O
behind O
a O
tree O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
began O
to O
be O
upset O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
force O
more O
women O
toward O
the O
hole O
. O

I O
heard O
shots O
and O
realized O
that O
they O
didn’t O
know O
I O
was O
missing O
and O
weren’t O
even O
looking O
for O
me O
. O

I O
heard O
them O
finish O
their O
task O
, O
strip O
the O
women O
, O
throw O
them O
into O
the O
hole O
, O
and O
fill O
up O
the O
hole O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
doctor O
. O

Then O
I O
must O
have O
fallen O
asleep O
, O
because O
I O
didn’t O
see O
them O
walk O
away O
from O
the O
hole O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
and O
saw O
from O
a O
distance O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
walking O
down O
the O
road O
with O
a O
wheelbarrow O
likely O
loaded O
with O
clothes O
taken O
from O
the O
people O
who O
were O
shot O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
saved O
. O

I O
started O
walking O
away O
. O

I O
went O
around O
the O
hole O
and O
crossed O
the O
main O
road O
that O
goes O
from O
Schlesiersee B-LOC
to O
Ostweide B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
I O
observed O
German B-LOC
tanks O
riding O
away O
from O
the O
forest O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

I O
thought O
that O
the O
frontline O
must O
be O
there O
and O
that O
I O
would O
meet O
up O
with O
the O
Russians B-LOC
any O
minute O
. O

And O
so O
I O
headed O
out O
on O
this O
road O
. O

After O
walking O
for O
about O
10 O
minutes O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
large O
haystack O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

I O
crawled O
inside O
of O
it O
and O
soon O
fell O
asleep O
. O

I O
was O
exhausted O
. O

We O
had O
marched O
the O
whole O
previous O
night O
, O
my O
leg O
was O
badly O
hurting O
, O
and O
to O
top O
it O
off O
my O
new O
neck O
wound O
, O
which O
hurt O
a O
little O
the O
first O
day O
. O

I O
slept O
until O
the O
morning O
and O
then O
headed O
out O
again O
. O

I O
walked O
through O
beautiful O
forests O
, O
along O
tank O
tracks O
, O
and O
didn’t O
meet O
a O
soul O
. O

I O
was O
terribly O
tired O
, O
but O
I O
was O
afraid O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
fall O
asleep O
and O
freeze O
to O
death O
. O

As O
the O
evening O
approached O
, O
I O
chanced O
upon O
a O
crumbling O
barn O
for O
hay O
, O
where O
I O
spent O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
walked O
on O
and O
around O
noon O
I O
finally O
entered O
a O
small O
village O
, O
utterly O
exhausted O
. O

I O
went O
into O
the O
first O
house O
and O
asked O
if O
they O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
rest O
here O
. O

I O
was O
delighted O
to O
hear O
that O
I O
was O
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

They O
gave O
me O
food O
and O
the O
next O
day O
the O
mayor O
took O
care O
of O
me O
. O

We O
burned O
my O
clothes O
, O
which O
were O
soaked O
with O
blood O
, O
and O
they O
gave O
me O
warm O
clothing O
, O
a O
dress O
, O
and O
blankets O
. O

I O
was O
given O
a O
room O
in O
a O
house O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
abandoned O
. O

Polish B-LOC
girls O
lit O
the O
fire O
in O
my O
room O
and O
brought O
me O
food O
. O

The O
village O
didn’t O
have O
a O
doctor O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
a O
nurse O
came O
to O
check O
up O
on O
me O
and O
changed O
the O
bandages O
on O
my O
leg O
and O
neck O
. O

I O
was O
in O
great O
pain O
and O
couldn’t O
sleep O
at O
night O
. O

Five O
days O
after O
my O
arrival O
in O
the O
village O
, O
i.e O
. O

a O
week O
after O
I O
was O
injured O
, O
the O
Russians B-LOC
came O
to O
the O
village O
and O
I O
was O
finally O
truly O
liberated O
. O

A O
week O
later O
, O
a O
Polish B-LOC
nurse O
took O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
in O
Wolstein B-LOC
. O

Fourteen O
days O
after O
I O
was O
shot O
was O
the O
first O
time O
I O
received O
medical O
assistance O
. O

I O
felt O
much O
better O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
I O
quickly O
recuperated O
, O
and O
my O
wounds O
healed O
up O
. O

On O
March B-DATE
18th I-DATE
, O
the O
Russians B-LOC
picked O
me O
up O
from O
the O
hospital O
and O
took O
me O
to O
Schwiebus B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
helped O
out O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

I O
remained O
in O
the O
service O
of O
a O
Russian B-LOC
unit O
that O
rode O
out O
to O
assist O
the O
Russian B-ORG
Army B-ORG
in O
combat O

After O
my O
military O
service O

I O
was O
discharged O
from O
duty O

taken O
to O
the O
repatriation O
committee O
in O
Prague B-LOC

Once O
in O

I O
found O
out O
that O
neither O
my O
husband O

nor O
my O
parents O

and O
neither O
my O
sister O
nor O
her O
husband O

Only O
my O

Before O
I O
left O
for O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO

I O
worked O
in O
an O
insurance O
office O

I O

Re O

Treatment O
of O
Jews O
As O
this O
Royal O
Legation O
reported O
in O
the O
telegram O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
transfer O
to O
Poland B-LOC
of O
the O
Jewish O
survivors O
left O

is O
currently O
under O
way O

The O
transfer O
is O
carried O
out O
with O
special O
trains O
provided O
by O
Croatian B-LOC
authorities O
, O
who O
, O
besides O

the O
people O

are O
also O
required O

pay O
the O

( O
Initially O
the O

had O
requested O
500 O

. O

The O
said O
measures O
have O
led O
to O
a O

– O
as O
the O
Poglavnik B-PERS
himself O
has O
confirmed O
– O
by O
the O
Apostolic O
Delegate O
here O
, O
which O
brought O
no O

It O
seems O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
category O
formed O
by O
Aryans O
joined O
in O
matrimony O
to O
Jews O
will O
be O
left O

in O
a O
conversation O
he O
had O
with O
the O

Minister O
about O
various O

hinted O
at O
the O
advisability O
of O
starting O

asked O
how O

He O
added O
that O
the O
larger O

as O

that O

about O

make O

Giustiniani B-PERS
I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
Ambassador O
Stoica B-PERS
, O
formerly O
Ambassador O
at O
Ankara B-LOC
and O
now O
Under O
Secretary O
of O
Propaganda O
, O
told O
me O
the O
other O
evening O
at O
dinner O
at O
my O
house O
in O
honor O
of O
himself O
and O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
newspapers O
, O
that O
his O
Government B-ORG
was O
going O
to O
do O
everything O
within O
its O
power O
to O
prevent O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
outbreaks O
, O
but O
that O
it O
greatly O
feared O
such O
outbreaks O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Army O
as O
the O
latter O
was O
so O
incensed O
at O
the O
treatment O
meted O
out O
to O
it O
by O
the O
Jews O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
when O
it O
was O
withdrawing O
. O

I O
observed O
that O
for O
once O
Rumania B-LOC
had O
a O
good O
press O
in O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
where O
there O
was O
great O
sympathy O
because O
it O
had O
been O
set O
upon O
by O
a O
powerful O
nation O
of O
180,000,000 O
people O
, O
and O
that O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
sacrifice O
this O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
Pogrom O
or O
two O
. O

On O
another O
recent O
occasion O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
informally O
to O
emphasize O
to O
Prime O
Minister O
Gigurtu B-PERS
that O
any O
internal O
disturbance O
, O
especially O
Jewish O
persecution O
, O
might O
easily O
be O
seized O
upon O
by O
Russia B-LOC
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
further O
action O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Gigurtu B-PERS
group O
maintains O
that O
to O
pass O
rigid O
laws O
against O
Jews O
at O
the O
present O
critical O
moment O
would O
seriously O
affect O
the O
economic O
structure O
of O
the O
State O
, O
as O
well O
as O
create O
a O
most O
unfortunate O
impression O
among O
nations O
abroad O
, O
particularly O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Some O
observers O
take O
the O
view O
that O
should O
there O
be O
no O
further O
pressure O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Bulgaria B-LOC
for O
territorial O
cession O
at O
present O
the O
moderate O
group O
will O
win O
its O
point O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
strong O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
reaction O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
; O
if O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Government O
is O
forced O
to O
cede O
more O
territory O
immediately O
, O
a O
cession O
for O
which O
public O
opinion O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
prepared O
, O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
thesis O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
win O
because O
the O
Government O
will O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
resort O
to O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
agitation O
as O
a O
cloak O
and O
counter O
- O
irritant O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
a O
few O
mild O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
have O
been O
announced O
but O
nothing O
to O
suggest O
a O
really O
vicious O
program O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
I O
accordingly O
feel O
that O
no O
really O
strong O
Jewish O
persecutions O
are O
apt O
to O
eventuate O
in O
the O
near O
future O
except O
as O
they O
may O
arise O
out O
of O
new O
circumstances O
created O
by O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
events O
or O
further O
dissatisfaction O
in O
the O
Army O
. O

But O
, O
as O
earlier O
despatches O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
has O
definitely O
worsened O
since O
the O
inauguration O
of O
the O
present B-ORG
regime I-ORG
three O
months O

. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the O
green O
- O
shirted O
Iron O
Guard O
is O
in O
power O
, O
and O
the O
Iron O
Guard O
is O
notoriously O
and O
avowedly O
an O
essentially O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
organization O
. O

In O
the O
second O
place O
, O
Rumania B-LOC
not O
only O
has O
come O
under O
the O
direct O
‘ O
influence O
’ O
of O
Nazi O
Germany O
but O
is O
now O
actually O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Axis O
and O
an O
adherent O
to O
the O
Tripartite O
Pact O
. O

And O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
country O
requires O
scape O
- O
goats O
for O
all O
the O
evils O
and O
misfortunes O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
finds O
that O
the O
Jews O
, O
along O
with O
former O
King B-PERS
Carol I-PERS
and O
the O
old O
politicians O
, O
serve O
admirably O
in O
this O
unhappy O
role O
. O

These O
considerations O
, O
plus O
an O
underlying O
sentiment O
of O
genuine O
anti O
- O
Semitism O
generally O
, O
provide O
sufficient O
reason O
and O
background O
for O
Jewish O
fears O
and O
sufferings O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
today O
. O

[ O

In O
recent O

the O
Jewish O
plaint O
has O
not O
been O
one O
of O
lost O
positions O

special O

that O
is O
an O

Jewish O
question O
The O
coldness O
with O
which O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Catholic O
press O
has O
greeted O
the O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
action O
of O
Minister O
of O
Interior O
Mach B-PERS
is O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Catholic O
population O
which O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
provinces O
, O
feels O
no O
ill O
will O
towards O
Jews O
and O
because O
of O
their O
meekness O
and O
religious O
upbringing O
disagrees O
with O
the O
violent O
methods O
used O
by O
the O
men O
carrying O
out O
the O
expulsion O
decrees O
. O

There O
have O
even O
been O
instances O
in O
which O
local O
authorities O
have O
not O
carried O
out O
or O
carried O
out O
only O
partially O
the O
ministerial O
orders O

As O
many O
as O
three O

have O
been O
deposed O
or O
recalled O
and O
subjected O
to O
an O
enquiry O
. O

Church O
authorities O
have O
also O
objected O
to O
the O
methods O
employed O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
the O
Minister O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
to O
the O
Vatican B-LOC
has O
been O
here O
, O
and O
there O
have O
been O
rumours O
about O
a O
note O
from O
the O
Secretariat O
of O
State O
to O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Legation O

There O
has O
indeed O
been O
such O
a O
step O
and O
the O
Chargé O

of O
the O
Holy O

here O
has O
repeatedly O
seen O
the O
Prime B-PERS
Minister I-PERS

Minister O
for O
Foreign O
Affairs O
on O
this O
issue O

Also O
, O
there O
have O
been O
critical O
voices O
against O
Mach B-PERS
within O
the O
Government O
itself O
, O
coming O
from O
his O
colleagues O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-ORG
people I-ORG

party I-ORG
Nonetheless O
, O
the O
forced O
exodus O
of O
Jews O
has O
continued O
and O
continues O
still O
. O

It O
is O
illegal O
, O
as O
no O
law O
authorizing O
it O
exists O
. O

There O
is O
– O
for O
now O
– O
only O
a O
bill O
approved O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
by O
the O
Council O
of O
Minister O
which O
has O
still O
to O
be O
submitted O
to O

The O
full O
powers O
granted O
by O
Parliament O
to O
the O
Government O
in O
1940 O
to O
proceed O
against O
Jews O
cannot O
possibly O
apply O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
exodus O

As O
I O
have O
learned O
from O
Minister O
Mach B-PERS
himself O
, O
of O
the O
90,000 O
Jews O
who O
were O
in O
Slovakia B-LOC

March O
last O
( O
in O
1939 O
there O
were O
120,000 O
, O
30,000 O
of O
whom O
have O
voluntarily O
left O
the O
country O
after O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
independent O
Slovak O
State O
) O
, O
13,000 O
have O
been O
deported O
these O
past O
weeks O
to O
the O
Katowice B-LOC
area O
and O
to O
the O
General B-LOC
Governorate I-LOC
and O
those O
remaining O
will O
follow O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
6 O
months O
. O

Mach B-PERS
told O
me O
“ O
The O
Jews O
were O
dominating O
our O
economy O
” O
, O
and O
ended O
by O
saying O
that O
to O
remedy O
such O
a O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
the O
time O
for O
half O
measures O
is O
over O
. O

When O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
acted O
because O
forced O
to O
do O
so O
by O
the O
Germans O
, O
the O
Minister B-PERS
of I-PERS
Interior I-PERS
declared O
to O
the O
press O
, O
as O
reported O
with O
Cable O
no O
. O

1095/245 O
from O
27th B-DATE
March I-DATE
, O
that O
the O
expulsion O
of O
Jews O
had O
been O
decided O
“ O
spontaneously O
and O
with O
full O
persuasion O
” O
. O

I O
have O
been O
told O
by O
the O
German O
Minister O
here O
that O
his O
Government O
had O
not O
used O
any O
pressure O
but O
had O
simply O
made O
a O
suggestion O
that O
had O
been O
accepted O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
the O
President B-PERS
of I-PERS
the I-PERS
Republic I-PERS
has O
done O
his O
utmost O
to O
mitigate O
the O
harshness O
of O
the O
methods O
employed O
for O
the O
exodus O
and O
made O
use O
, O
despite O
a O
strong O
opposition O
from O
the O
Prime B-PERS
Minister I-PERS
himself O
, O
of O
the O
right O
to O
discriminate O
granted O
him O
by O
the O
“ O
Jewish O
Code O
” O
in O
order O
to O
save O
a O
great O
many O
persons O
from O
expulsion O
. O

Clearly O
, O
if O
President B-PERS
Tiso I-PERS
has O
not O
done O
more O
and O
has O
even O
prevented O
a O
press O
controversy O
on O
the O
Jewish O
question O
from O
breaking O
out O
( O
all O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
press O
, O
belatedly O
, O
were O
two O
critical O
articles O
in O
the O
Catholic O
newspapers O
Slovak O
and O
Slovenska O
Pravda O
) O
, O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
finds O
himself O
unable O
to O
oppose O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Reich O
, O
which O
has O
in O
Tuka B-PERS

in O
Mach B-PERS

in O
regard O
to O
the O

question O

It O
is O
also O
likely O
that O
Monsignor O

that O
under O
any O

he O
can O
be O

useful O

could O
only O

’ O

a O
little O
easier O
. O

They O
couldn’t O
avert O
their O
terrible O
fate O
. O

It O
is O
learned O
that O
the O
some O
1200 O
Jews O
removed O
from O
Stettlin B-LOC
have O
been O
settled O
in O
three O
small O
towns O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
Lublin B-LOC
where O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
now O
living O
under O
conditions O
of O
considerable O
hardship O
and O
poverty O
. O

According O
to O
reliable O
information O
the O
order O
for O
the O
deportation O
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
Schneidemuhl B-LOC
was O
issued O
by O
the O
same O
local O
authority O
who O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
action O
taken O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
. O

An O
arrangement O
has O
been O
tentatively O
concluded O
whereby O
the O
Schneidemuhl B-LOC
Jews O
will O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
Eastern O
Poland B-LOC
as O
has O
been O
the O
case O
with O
those O
from O
Stettin B-LOC
but O
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
Reich O
. O

What O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
press O
of O
neutral O
countries O
, O
namely O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
said O
to O
be O
negotiating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
Germany O
and O
with O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
concerning O
the O
removal O
from O
Bulgaria B-LOC
of O
significant O
groups O
of O
press O
of O
Israelites O
, O
is O
true O
. O

Germany O
has O
offered O
to O
transfer O
the O
Bulgarian O
Jewish O
groups O
to O
the O
ghettoes O
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
has O
asked O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
pay O
the O
sum O
of O
five O
- O
hundred O
marks O
per O
person O
for O
transport O
costs O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
property O
seized O
locally O
. O

Bulgarians O
have O
resisted O
this O
request O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
nothing O
has O
been O
decided O
as O
yet O
on O
the O
financial O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
departures O
of O
Jews O
for O
Poland B-LOC
have O
already O
begun O
, O
albeit O
limited O
to O
the O
Jewish O
groups O
living O
in O
the O
new O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territories O
, O
Thrace B-LOC
and O
Macedonia B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
are O
Jewish O
communities O
that O
have O
been O
estimated O
at O
approx O
. O

twenty O
- O
thousand O
individuals O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
ancient O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territory O
nothing O
definite O
has O
been O
decided O
, O
because O
reportedly O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
opposing O
a O
marked O
resistance O
. O

With O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
there O
have O
been O
negotiations O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Government I-ORG
about O
dispatching O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
four O
- O
thousand O
adult O
Bulgarian O
Jews O
and O
four O
- O
thousand O
Jewish O
children O
. O

But O
the O
Reich O
has O
stepped O
in O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
has O
“ O
vetoed O
” O
this O
departure O
, O
judging O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
that O
it O
is O
dangerous O
to O
transfer O
to O
an O
enemy O
territory O
such O
decidedly O
anti O
- O
German O
elements O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
apparently O
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
has O
resumed O
these O
negotiations O
despite O
that O
“ O
veto O
” O
, O
limiting O
them O
to O
the O
four O
- O
thousand O
children O
who O
would O
be O
accompanied O
by O
no O
more O
than O
five O
- O
hundred O
adults O
. O

This O
negotiation O
as O
well O
, O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
encounter O
problems O

we O

facts O
emerge O

place O

true O

First O
of O

the O

is O
still O
far O
from O

I O
mean O
the O
absence O

in O
the O

of O
an O

the O

that O
have O
been O

it O
is O
fairly O
easy O
to O

it O

all O
Jews O
holding O

Hungarian B-LOC
elements O
that O
are O
capable O
of O
occupying O
the O
posts O
at O
present O
held O
by O
Jews O
will O
Hungary B-LOC
be O
able O
to O
face O
the O
actual O
expulsions O
of O
the O
latter O
from O
the O
most O
vital O
hubs O
of O
its O
economic O
structure O
. O

This O
necessity O
highlights O
another O
delicate O
aspect O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
is O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
them O
, O
Hungary B-LOC
cannot O
do O
without O
the O
, O
albeit O
limited O
, O
cooperation O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
cannot O
be O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
this O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
part O
of O
its O
population O
and O
as O
to O
the O
influence O
it O
has O
on O
public O
opinion O
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
since O
an O
immediate O
and O
complete O
solution O
of O
the O
problem O
looks O
impossible O
, O
the O
Hungarian O
Government O
intends O
to O
continue O
to O
keep O
the O
Jewish O
question O
alive O
and O
open O
; O
its O
final O
conclusion O
, O
as O
President O
Kalláy B-PERS
said O
in O
his O
latest O
speech O
, O
will O
be O
removal O
outside O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
of O
all O
the O
800,000 O
Jews O
living O
in O
the O
Country O
. O

As O
I O
already O
said O
, O
the O
numerous O
mixed O
marriages O
entered O
into O
by O
the O
Jews O
served O
them O
well O
in O
strengthening O
their O
position O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
ignored O
that O
in O
joining O
their O
power O
to O
that O
of O
many O
aristocratic O
and O
middle O
class O
families O
, O
the O
Jews O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
have O
created O
a O
network O
of O
shared O
interests O
and O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
very O
social O
classes O
that O
ought O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

And O
they O
have O
contributed O
not O
a O
little O
to O
the O
spreading O
of O
the O
liberal O
ideology O
, O
which O
in O
this O
Country O
is O
perhaps O
more O
enduring O
than O
in O
others O
. O

The O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
therefore O
poses O
for O
Hungary B-LOC
a O
distressful O
and O
difficult O
problem O
as O
it O
closely O
concerns O
its O
social O
structure O
and O
its O
economic O
organization O
, O
and O
this O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Country O
needs O
all O
its O
energies O
to O
face O
its O
new O
and O
important O
tasks O
. O

This O
explains O
the O
hesitancy O
apparent O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
action O
and O
a O
certain O
scepticism O
displayed O
even O
today O
by O
many O
towards O
the O
effectiveness O
and O
even O
towards O
the O
sincerity O
of O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
policies O
, O
But O
the O
Government O
’s O
will O
to O
advance O
on O
the O
road O
it O
has O
in O
part O
already O
covered O
does O
not O
appear O
in O
doubt O
and O
it O
may O
not O
be O
unnecessary O
to O
point O
out O
that O
considerations O
and O
influences O
of O
an O
international O
nature O
are O
not O
without O
bearing O
on O
this O
will O
. O

Please O
accept O
, O
Sir O
, O
the O
expression O
of O
my O
profound O
respect O
. O

Anfuso B-PERS
Mr O

Foreign B-ORG
Minister I-ORG
I O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
forwarding O
the O
3 O
copies O
of O
the O
confidential O
report O
received O
from O
the O
Royal O

in O

concerning O
- O
the O
Conditions O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
of I-LOC
Bohemia I-LOC
and I-LOC
Moravia I-LOC
. O

I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
remain O
with O
the O
highest O
consideration O
Dear O
Chamberlain O
Zahle B-PERS
The O
situation O
has O
worsened O
considerably O
, O
since O
21 O
September O
of O
the O
same O
year O
, O
when O
I O
last O
reported O
about O
the O
conditions O
here O
. O

By O
the O
messages O
I O
have O
received O
I O
am O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
State O
Protector O
and O
several O
of O
his O
officials O
sincerely O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
good O
relationship O
between O
Germans B-LOC
and O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
party B-ORG
with O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
German O
Secretary O
of O
State O
, O
Mr O
. O

Frank B-PERS
at O
the O
helm O
have O
completely O
lacked O
the O
tact O
needed O
or O
they O
may O
have O
thought O
that O
with O
hardness O
one O
should O
suppress O
any O
resistance O
from O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

Now O
you O
can O
see O
a O
Germanization B-ORG
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
in O
all O
areas O
. O

Many O
Czech O
estates O
, O
whose O
owners O
at O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
stayed O
abroad O
and O
did O
not O
return O
home O
, O
and O
estates O
which O
, O
at O
the O
demarcation O
, O
were O
located O
partly O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
and O
partly O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
, O
are O
placed O
under O
German O
administration O
. O

It O
is O
expected O
, O
that O
similar O
extensions O
will O
take O
place O
in O
regard O
to O
German B-LOC
Colonization O
. O

Jewish O
businesses O
are O
mostly O
being O
handed O
over O
to O
Germans O
. O

In O
Banks O
and O
Industrial O
Enterprises O
, O
there O
is O
strong O
pressure O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
side O
for O
mergers O
and O
transactions O
, O
so O
that O
the O
main O
influence O
of O
the O
company O
in O
question O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
rich O
German B-LOC
banks O
. O

Perhaps O
some O
of O
these O
transactions O
- O
as O
a O
bank O
director O
familiar O
with O
Czech O
transactions O
in O
the O
post O
- O
World O
Bank O
banking O
sector O
, O
has O
told O
me O
- O
are O
merely O
restitutions O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
proceed O
with O
greater O
severity O
and O
consistency O
than O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Your O
honour O
Mr O
Chamberlain O
Herluf B-PERS
Zahle I-PERS
Royal O
envoy O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
Everywhere O
the O
German O
language O
is O
being O
preferred O
over O
the O
Czech O
language O
. O

Learning O
institutions O
and O
theatres O
are O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
and O
Germans O
are O
hired O
in O
all O
institutions O
and O
administration O
offices O
. O

For O
example O
, O
an O
order O
has O
been O
imposed O
on O
the O
Tram O
conductors O
to O
call O
out O
the O
stations O
, O
first O
in O
German O
and O
then O
secondly O
in O
Czech O
, O
has O
caused O
unnecessary O
commotion O
of O
the O
public O
. O

In O
Bohemia B-LOC
and I-LOC
Moravia I-LOC
, O
there O
were O
no O
food O
shortages O
and O
before O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
there O
were O
large O
supplies O
and O
industrial O
goods O
of O
great O
quality O
. O

In O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
, O
the O
stocks O
have O
been O
emptied O
and O
a O
rationing O
system O
has O
been O
introduced O
. O

The O
rationing O
is O
not O
yet O
as O
widespread O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
but O
it O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
this O
happens O
and O
then O
there O
will O
be O
a O
Gleichschaltung O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Dualism O
in O
the O
Administration O
contributes O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
demand O
for O
rationed O
consumer O
goods O
is O
hardly O
as O
well O
organized O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
. O

People O
often O
go O
to O
buy O
items O
, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
card O
system O
should O
be O
available O
just O
to O
find O
out O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O

After O
the O
Munich O
Decree O
last O
year O
, O
the O
diminished O
territory O
of O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
was O
established O
, O
and O
many O
Czechs B-LOC
believed O
that O
with O
a O
little O
goodwill O
they O
could O
establish O
great O
relations O
with O
the O
German O
Empire O
. O

After O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
, O
a O
few O
people O
still O
hoped O
this O
was O
possible O
but O
now O
you O
won’t O
find O
a O
single O
Czech O
person O
that O
doesn’t O
feel O
resentment O
against O
Germany O
. O

I O
don’t O
think O
that O
these O
feelings O
will O
cause O
any O
outbreaks O
as O
long O
as O
the O
German O
discipline O
stands O
firm O
. O

The O
people O
are O
not O
armed O
and O
they O
know O
that O
the O
German B-ORG
troops I-ORG
and O
the O
German O
police O
will O
suppress O
any O
demonstration O
with O
extreme O
brutality O
. O

In O
the O
first O
period O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
there O
where O
arrests O
among O
the O
supporters O
of O
Beneš B-PERS
' I-PERS
, O
undesired O
politicians O
, O
legionaries O
, O
and O
others O
. O

However O
, O
many O
of O
the O
arrested O
have O
since O
been O
released O
and O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
main O
clash O
with O
Germans O
and O
people O
not O
well O
regarded O
by O
them O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

When O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
activity O
increased O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
before O
- O
mentioned O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Military O
were O
now O
also O
arrested O
, O
as O
well O
as O
people O
from O
the O
industries O
, O
clerics O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Ever O
since O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
arrests O
won’t O
stop O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O
a O
system O
in O
the O
actions O
of O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
you O
might O
see O
this O
as O
taking O
hostages O
. O

A O
former O
Czech O
politician O
and O
diplomat O
, O
which O
has O
been O
retired O
for O
several O
years O
, O
told O
me O
about O
some O
of O
the O
arrests O
. O

He O
told O
about O
how O
certain O
people O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
list O
of O
arrests O
had O
remained O
in O
Freedom O
– O
at O
least O
until O
now O
– O
just O
because O
they O
were O
not O
at O
home O
when O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
came O
for O
them O
, O
so O
the O
police O
went O
on O
to O
the O
next O
one O
on O
the O
list O
. O

My O
informant O
told O
me O
that O
he O
changed O
his O
residence O
because O
he O
was O
afraid O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
arrested O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
arrested O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration B-CAMP
camp I-CAMP
Buchenwald I-CAMP
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

A O
reliable O
source O
told O
me O
that O
the O
internees O
are O
treated O
just O
as O
it O
is O
described O
in O
the O
newly O
published O
English O
white O
paper O
about O
German O
concentration O
camps O
. O

The O
prominent O
Jews O
, O
the O
ones O
who O
lived O
there O
before O
the O
World O
War O
, O
are O
not O
as O
affected O
by O
the O
Jewish O
persecutions O
as O
others O
. O

I O
know O
of O
several O
examples O
of O
Jewish O
Bank O
Directors O
, O
although O
retired O
, O
that O
are O
working O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
daily O
in O
the O
Bank O
to O
explain O
the O
conditions O
to O
the O
new O
Managers O
and O
live O
peacefully O
in O
their O
villas O
. O

However O
, O
they O
had O
to O
turn O
in O
their O
cars O
and O
radios O
. O

I O
have O
also O
heard O
of O
Jewish O
lawyers O
that O
work O
from O
home O
and O
then O
have O
their O
Aryan O
colleagues O
take O
the O
cases O
to O
court O
. O

Some O
Jewish O
doctors O
have O
been O
given O
temporary O
work O
in O
hospitals O
. O

Jews O
who O
can’t O
prove O
a O
permanent O
residence O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
seem O
to O
be O
facing O
very O
bad O
times O
. O

They O
will O
probably O
all O
be O
transferred O
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
regions O
around O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

From O
Mährisch B-LOC
Ostrau I-LOC
, O
many O
Hundreds O
of O
Jews O
have O
already O
been O
sent O
to O
this O
area O
to O
do O
Labour O
service O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
great O
relocation O
. O

Under O
the O
conditions O
described O
above O
, O
the O
former O
Czechoslovakia O
National O
Day O
, O
on O
October O
28 O
, O
was O
met O
with O
great O
anxiety O
. O

When O
it O
was O
reported O
that O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
wanted O
to O
grieve O
that O
day O
, O
the O
Germans O
had O
planned O
a O
mourning O
ceremony O
for O
the O
fallen O
people O
in O
Poland O
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
then O
canceled O
their O
plans O
, O
and O
the O
Czech O
national O
unity O
party O
ordered O
its O
members O
to O
stay O
indoors O
and O
keep O
calm O
. O

The O
Germans O
also O
distanced O
themselves O
from O
holding O
the O
mourning O
ceremony O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Labour O
Day O
, O
the O
traffic O
in O
the O
main O
streets O
was O
very O
busy O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
prohibition O
, O
many O
Czech O
people O
wore O
cockades O
with O
silk O
ribbons O
in O
the O
Czechoslovakia O
colours O
, O
and O
many O
male O
persons O
covered O
their O
heads O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
cap O
of O
as O
the O
late O
President O
Masaryk B-PERS
usually O
wore O
. O

All O
the O
Czech B-ORG
Police I-ORG
was O
stationed O
in O
the O
Main O
Streets O
and O
the O
German B-ORG
Police I-ORG
and O
S.S. B-ORG
-members O
had O
taken O
up O
positions O
as O
a O
reserve O
in O
side O
streets O
and O
passages O
. O

The O
tensions O
erupted O
into O
fights O
as O
large O
sections O
the O
S.A. B-ORG
-members O
passed O
through O
the O
main O
streets O
with O
music O
, O
and O
various O
clashes O
between O
the O
Czech O
people O
's O
groups O
and O
the O
police O
took O
place O
. O

In O
some O
streets O
, O
the O
Communists O
demonstrated O
, O
and O
German O
police O
had O
to O
support O
the O
Czech O
police O
to O
get O
the O
streets O
cleared O
. O

During O
the O
clashes O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
persons O
( O
allegedly O
a O
dozen O
people O
) O
were O
killed O
and O
some O
of O
them O
were O
injured O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
young O
people O
were O
arrested O
. O

However O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
population O
’s O
agitated O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
the O
events O
must O
be O
considered O
less O
serious O
than O
one O
might O
have O
expected O
. O

This O
was O
also O
stated O
to O
me O
by O
a O
German O
Official O
from O
the O
Chancellor B-PERS
's I-PERS
Office O
. O

However O
, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
the O
incidents O
will O
give O
rise O
to O
new O
reprisals O
against O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
resentment O
against O
the O
Germans O
will O
then O
be O

It O

A O

Documents O
and O
the O
entire O

were O
taken O
away O
by O
the O
Americans B-LOC
, O
and O
parts O
thereof O
by O
the O
former O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
committee O
. O

Under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
commander O
, O
we O
inspected O
the O
camp O
guards O
and O
the O
infamous O
quarry O
. O

The O
camp O
itself O
is O
not O
very O
large O
. O

According O
to O
the O
statistics O
, O
it O
had O
a O
population O
of O
around O
10,000 O
. O

Under O
the O
main O
camp O
, O
there O
was O
a O
so O
- O
called O
Russian B-LOC
camp O
, O
ramshackle O
barracks O
that O
were O
mostly O
burned O
down O
by O
the O
Americans B-LOC
because O
they O
were O
completely O
infested O
with O
insects O
. O

This O
is O
also O
where O
the O
hospital O
was O
located O
. O

In O
the O
camp O
, O
we O
saw O
cleaned O
out O
barracks O
, O
the O
crematorium O
, O
which O
was O
relatively O
small O
and O
had O
three O
ovens O
, O
the O
bunkers O
, O
the O
rooms O
in O
the O
cellar O
where O
quick O
executions O
took O
place O
, O
and O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

Executions O
were O
carried O
out O
in O
various O
ways O
. O

In O
the O
cellar O
, O
people O
were O
killed O
with O
a O
special O
pistol O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
regular O
bullets O
, O
shot O
a O
6 O
- O
7 O
cm O
long O
nail O
into O
the O
head O
of O
the O
condemned O
that O
was O
subsequently O
removed O
to O
be O
used O
again O
. O

The O
gas O
chambers O
that O
were O
utilized O
in O
order O
to O
do O
away O
with O
the O
sick O
before O
the O
camp O
’s O
liberation O
had O
a O
capacity O
of O
around O
300 O
per O
day O
. O

However O
, O
the O
main O
place O
of O
execution O
was O
the O
quarry O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
place O
that O
horrifies O
even O
today O
’s O
visitors O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
it O
, O
you’ll O
see O
the O
image O
of O
the O
terrible O
slave O
labor O
of O
thousands O
of O
prisoners O
with O
your O
very O
own O
eyes O
. O

It O
’s O
obvious O
that O
nobody O
could O
have O
endured O
this O
hard O
work O
for O
very O
long O
. O

Its O
smooth O
wall O
was O
about O
80 O
metres O
high O
and O
teemed O
with O
exhausted O
, O
barefoot O
wretches O
dressed O
only O
in O
rags O
. O

The O
prisoners O
walked O
the O
roughly O
1,000 O
m O
to O
work O
from O
the O
camp O
on O
a O
road O
paved O
with O
sharp O
granite O
stones O
, O
and O
because O
their O
workplace O
was O
so O
close O
, O
for O
cost O
- O
saving O
reasons O
this O
commando O
’ O
s O
clogs O
were O
taken O
away O
in O
order O
to O
preserve O
them O
from O
being O
damaged O
. O

They O
walked O
to O
work O
barefoot O
and O
carried O
the O
heaviest O
boulders O
up O
the O
awful O
steps O
( O
we O
counted O
196 O
in O
total O
) O
also O
barefoot O
. O

The O
steps O
were O
uneven O
, O
crooked O
, O
slippery O
. O

All O
the O
while O
, O
the O
prisoners O
were O
constantly O
and O
violently O
prodded O
by O
the O
guards O
. O

They O
even O
had O
to O
jog O
up O
the O
stairs O
while O
carrying O
their O
heavy O
loads O
. O

If O
any O
of O
them O
fell O
over O
from O
exhaustion O
or O
couldn’t O
carry O
a O
stone O
that O
an O
SS O
- O
man O
deemed O
too O
small O
, O
it O
was O
immediately O
considered O
Arbeitssabotage O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
punishment O
for O
Arbeitssabotage O
— O
being O
thrown O
from O
a O
deathly O
height O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
100 O
to O
200 O
people O
perished O
in O
this O
cruel O
way O
. O

Later O
, O
their O
friends O
had O
to O
take O
their O
bloody O
and O
shattered O
bodies O
back O
to O
the O
crematorium O
. O

In O
the O
camp O
’s O
last O
year O
, O
no O
differences O
were O
made O
between O
Jewish O
and O
other O
prisoners O

The O
food O
was O
the O

as O
in O
other O

Around O

news O

us O

It O
was O
a O
very O
different O
camp O
from O
all O
the O
other O
concentration O
camps O
that O
we O
went O
through O
. O

Its O
main O
role O
was O
the O
willful O
and O
mass O
extermination O
of O
races O
and O
all O
living O
people O
who O
the O
rulers O

The O
task O

practically O
finished O

the O
extermination O
of O
the O
Jews O
from O

The O
conditions O
at O
that O
time O
were O
horrific O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
hundreds O
of O
starving O
prisoners O
were O
killed O
, O
people O
died O
in O
the O
blocks O
and O
courtyards O
, O
and O
many O
desperate O
people O
voluntarily O
chose O
to O
be O
shot O
. O

Every O
evening O
, O
the O
strongest O
prisoners O
were O
selected O
to O
carry O
away O
the O
dead O
bodies O
that O
were O
stored O
in O
block O
no O
. O

21 O
, O
from O
where O
they O
were O
driven O
away O
in O
cars O
. O

During O
this O
terrible O
work O
, O
the O
prisoners O
were O
tortured O
and O
beaten O
, O
for O
some O
corpses O
were O
already O
beginning O
to O
decompose O
. O

They O
were O
rewarded O
with O
pieces O
of O
bread O
, O
which O
there O
was O
enough O
of O
since O
there O
were O
so O
many O
dead O
. O

The O
hardest O
thing O
to O
bear O
was O
the O
lack O
of O
water O
. O

In O
the O
entire O
camp O
there O
was O
only O
one O
water O
tap O
for O
8 O
thousand O
prisoners O
. O

Bathing O
was O
practically O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O

Tea O
or O
coffee O
was O
distributed O
only O
partially O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
was O
kept O
by O
the O
prisoners O
who O
were O
employed O
in O
the O
blocks O
. O

The O
cost O
of O
water O
was O
high O
. O

One O
bottle O
of O
water O
went O
for O
half O
of O
the O
daily O
ration O
of O
bread O
. O

Under O
these O
conditions O
, O
the O
camp O
was O
completely O
lice O
infested O
. O

The O
shaving O
that O
took O
place O
every O
Sunday O
was O
a O
special O
kind O
of O
torment O
. O

Sundays O
in O
general O
were O
the O
worst O
days O
. O

The O
labor O
units O
didn’t O
go O
to O
their O
usual O
places O
outside O
of O
the O
camp O
on O
Sundays O
. O

All O
of O
the O
general O
population O
prisoners O
were O
chased O
out O
onto O
the O
camp O
street O
, O
where O
they O
were O
encircled O
by O
rows O
of O
SS O
- O
men O
, O
Kapos O
, O
and O
Vorarbeiters O
armed O
with O
sticks O
. O

The O
prisoners O
had O
to O
run O
through O
the O
rows O
, O
carrying O
soil O
from O
one O
pile O
to O
another O
in O
their O
hats O
or O
inside O
their O
coats O
. O

We O
had O
to O
run O
through O
water O
and O
mud O
. O

All O
the O
while O
, O
they O
shouted O
at O
and O
beat O
us O
. O

This O
frenzy O
lasted O
until O
11 O
o’clock O
. O

One O
Sunday O
in O
May O
, O
they O
beat O
to O
death O
300 O
people O
and O
hundreds O
were O
injured O
so O
severely O
that O
they O
succumbed O
to O
their O
wounds O
and O
died O
. O

After O
lunch O
, O
we O
bathed O
in O
a O
pothole O
filled O
with O
water O
, O
from O
which O
prisoners O
emerged O
completely O
covered O
in O
mud O
and O
, O
laughed O
at O
by O
the O
kapos O
and O
block O
leaders O
, O
were O
chased O
back O
to O
the O
block O
for O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Bettruhe O
– O
this O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
our O
rest O
time O
. O

The O
leading O
prisoners O
, O
block O
leaders O
, O
scribe O
, O
and O
kapo O
were O
lords O
with O
limitless O
powers O
over O
life O
and O
death O
, O
as O
is O
illustrated O
by O
an O
incident O
that O
took O

At O
the O

, O
block O
leader O
Štěpán B-PERS
Vierbiczs I-PERS
from O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia B-LOC
summoned O
his O
fellow O
prisoners O
and O
asked O
those O
who O
would O
like O
to O
be O
set O
free O
to O
come O
forward O
. O

14 O
new O
prisoners O
, O
Slovak B-LOC
Jews O
, O
stepped O
forward O
. O

The O
block O
leader O
asked O
his O
scribe O
to O
fill O
out O
white O
forms O
. O

The O
prisoners O
who O
had O
stepped O
forward O
had O
to O
strip O
, O
whereupon O
they O
were O
beaten O
to O
death O
by O
the O
block O
leader O
and O
his O
staff O
. O

The O
white O
forms O
were O
death O
certificates O
( O
Totenmeldung O
) O
. O

The O
block O
leader O
then O
announced O
to O
the O
astounded O
onlookers O
that O
this O
would O
happen O
to O
anyone O
who O
wanted O
to O
go O
home O
. O

Štefan B-PERS
also O
killed O
people O
with O
the O
tried O
and O
true O
method O
of O
three O
blows O
with O
a O
stick O
. O

The O
first O
blow O
was O
aimed O
at O
a O
bowed O
back O
that O
forced O
the O
prisoner O
to O
stand O
straight O
. O

The O
murderer O
took O
advantage O
of O
this O
upright O
position O
to O
strike O
the O
victim O
across O
the O
chest O
over O
the O
place O
where O
the O
heart O
is O
. O

The O
prisoner O
would O
cover O
his O
chest O
with O
his O
hands O
and O
double O
over O
in O
pain O
. O

And O
then O
came O
the O
final O
death O
blow O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
head O
, O
which O
usually O
broke O
the O
poor O
man O

The O
most O

operational O
buildings O
were O
the O
4 O
crematoriums O
with O
ten O
gas O
chambers O
and O
46 O
incineration O
ovens O
, O
and O
two O
buildings O
adapted O
for O
the O
poisoning O
of O
people O
, O
the O
so O

called O
Bunker O
V. O
The O
crematoriums O
were O
projected O
and O
built O
exclusively O
for O
a O
single O
task O
: O
mass O
extermination O

The O
crematoriums O
were O
labelled O
I. O

, O
III O

, O
and O
IV O
. O

The O
first O
two O
were O

chambers O
, O
and O
the O
second O
two O
were O
smaller O
with O

The O
disinfection O
station O
was O
an O
independent O
building O
placed O
between O
crematorium O
III O
and O
II O
. O

All O
camps O
, O
crematoriums O
, O
and O
the O
disinfection O
station O
formed O
one O
whole O
, O
surrounded O
by O
the O
so O
- O
called O
small O
chain O
of O
guard O

. O

These O
were O
tall O
wooden O
booths O
built O
close O
to O
the O
barbed O
wire O
fences O
with O
about O
50 O
m O
between O
each O
tower O
. O

At O
night O
, O
they O
were O
occupied O
by O
guards O
, O
whereas O
during O
the O
day O
the O
guards O
occupied O
the O
so O
- O
called O
big O
chain O
of O
guard O
towers O
, O
i.e O
. O

the O
space O
where O
almost O
all O
labor O
units O
worked O

In O
front O
of O
the O
entrance O
to O
each O
camp O
there O
was O
a O
guardhouse O
, O
the O
so O

called O
Blockführerstube O

It O
was O
manned O
by O
SS O

officers O

Every O
prisoner O
or O
labor O
unit O
that O
left O
the O
camp O
had O
to O
announce O
himself O
at O
the O
guardhouse O
and O
his O
number O
was O
taken O
down O
until O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
camp O

The O
SS O

men O
at O
the O
guardhouse O
controlled O
the O
exiting O

was O
the O
place O
where O
the O
SS O
- O
men O
trained O
dogs O
to O
chase O
prisoners O
. O

It O
was O
dangerous O
for O
prisoners O
in O
striped O
clothes O
to O
walk O
around O
these O
dogs O
because O
the O
dogs O
could O
not O
be O

when O
they O

The O
economic O
estate O

the O

was O
a O
farm O
where O
prisoners O
, O
both O
men O

, O
worked O
on O
plots O
that O
were O
left O
over O
after O
the O

We O
managed O
to O
acquire O
the O
plan O
of O
Birkenau B-CAMP
with O
the O
ground O
plans O
of O
the O
crematoriums O
. O

The O
plan O
of O
the O
disinfection O
station O
is O
drawn O
according O
to O
my O
memory O
. O

The O
dimensions O
are O
approximate O

as O
close O
as O

could O
estimate O

the O

were O
two O
circular O
buildings O
placed O
between O
the O
crematorium O
and O
the O
disinfection O
station O
. O

The O
purpose O
was O
to O
dry O
out O
excrement O
for O
the O
production O
of O
fertilizer O
. O

From O
this O
short O
description O
of O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
is O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
concentration O
camp O
was O
different O
from O
the O
others O
. O

Its O
goal O
was O
to O
exterminate O
by O
any O
means O
. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
camp O
and O
the O
means O
of O
extermination O
was O
so O
large O
that O
if O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
won O
, O
the O
Slavic O
nations O
would O
have O
been O
on O
the O
doorstep O
of O
this O
murder O
factory O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
Birkenau B-CAMP
was O
a O
secret O
even O
within O
the O
SS O
. O

Each O
transport O
going O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
was O
deceived O
and O
lured O
in O
by O
a O
ruse O
. O

Everything O
that O
happened O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
was O
a O
delusion O
, O
deceit O
, O
lies O
, O
and O
murder O
. O

The O
impertinence O
of O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
camps O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
deceive O
the O
bereaved O
surviving O
family O
members O
of O
the O
victims O
. O

The O
urns O

What O
It O
Looked O

In O
Birkenau B-CAMP

there O
were O
four O

for O
the O

, O
we O
sent O
them O
to O
the O
home O

with O
Mr O
. O

Soukup B-PERS
. O

We O
assumed O
at O
the O
time O
that O
the O
crematoriums O
and O
us O
, O
as O
witnesses O
to O
German B-LOC
crimes O
, O
would O
be O
removed O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
, O
the O
crematorium O
building O
looked O
like O
large O
bakeries O
. O

They O
were O
single O
- O
level O
buildings O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
style O
with O
a O
slanted O
roof O
, O
barred O
windows O
, O
and O
attic O
dormers O
. O

The O
courtyard O
was O
nicely O
laid O
out O
as O
a O
park O
or O
garden O
, O
the O
paths O
were O
covered O
in O
sand O
, O
and O
flowers O
bloomed O
in O
cultivated O
plots O
. O

The O
underground O
gas O
chambers O
rose O
about O
50 O
cm O
above O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
courtyard O
. O

They O
were O
covered O
in O
grass O
and O
made O
to O
look O
like O
a O
terrace O
garden O
. O

If O
you O
saw O
them O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
you O
would O
never O
be O
able O
to O
guess O
what O
they O
were O
. O

The O
whole O
courtyard O
was O
surrounded O
by O
an O
electrified O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
. O

Crematoriums O
I O
and O
II O
were O
right O
next O
to O
the O
camp O
and O
were O
visible O
from O
all O
sides O
. O

Crematoriums O
III O
and O
IV O
were O
hidden O
in O
a O
small O
forest O
. O

Tall O
pines O
and O
birches O
sheltered O
them O
and O
bore O
witness O
to O
thousands O
of O
tragedies O
. O

Around O
the O
crematoriums O
were O
long O
, O
tall O
stacks O
of O
wood O
brought O
there O
by O
train O
. O

They O
were O
there O
in O
readiness O
for O
the O
next O
victims O
. O

Each O
crematorium O
had O
two O
underground O
chambers O
. O

The O
first O
one O
was O
bigger O
and O
was O
used O
as O
a O
changing O
room O
, O
and O
the O
second O
as O
the O
actual O
gas O
chamber O
. O

See O
the O

the O
dimensions O
and O

The O
dressing O

was O
whitewashed O

in O
the O
middle O
were O
square O

spaced O
out O
about O
4 O

Benches O
lined O
the O

On O
the O

along O
the O
rounded O

were O
water O

The O
second O
chamber O
was O
where O
people O
were O
gassed O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bit O
smaller O
and O
looked O
like O
a O
group O

Showers O
were O
mounted O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
mesh O

was O
to O
prevent O
access O
and O
interference O
with O
the O

In O
the O

an O

The O

were O
on O
the O

of O
the O

The O
incinerators O
of O
crematoriums O
I O
and O

had O
15 O
three O

On O
the O
bottom O

The O
corpses O
, O
brought O
here O
from O
the O
elevator O
on O
carts O
, O
were O
placed O
on O
them O
. O

The O
ovens O
had O
think O
cast O
- O
iron O
doors O
that O
opened O
with O
a O
pulley O
. O

On O
the O
ground O
floor O
, O
there O
was O
also O
an O
autopsy O
room O
, O
where O
doctors O
from O
the O
Sonderkomnando O
carried O
out O
various O
experiments O
and O
autopsies O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
SS O
doctors O

Next O
to O
the O
autopsy O
room O
was O
an O
execution O
room O
. O

The O
back O
wall O
was O
black O
. O

The O
smooth O
cement O
floor O
had O
a O
slanted O
drain O
in O
the O
middle O
though O
which O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
executed O
flowed O
away O
. O

On O
the O
right O
side O
, O
there O
were O
invisible O
doors O
leading O
to O
the O
elevator O
that O
brought O
the O
executed O

to O
the O
incinerator O
. O

There O
was O
also O
an O
electric O
motor O
engine O
room O
, O
ventilators O
, O
an O
oven O
for O
the O
burning O
of O

The O
back O

Access O
to O
the O
underground O
chambers O
was O
through O
the O
courtyard O
and O
down O
the O
steps O
. O

A O
cement O
slide O
facilitated O
the O
transfer O
of O
the O
old O
, O
the O
sick O
, O
the O
half O
dead O
, O
and O
the O
dead O
. O

The O
bodies O
of O
the O
victims O
slid O
down O
it O
straight O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
like O
a O
sack O
of O
potatoes O
. O

The O
gas O
chambers O
of O
crematoriums O
I O
and O
II O
could O
process O
1,500 O
to O
2,000 O
people O
each O
. O

Crematoriums O
III O
and O
IV O
were O
smaller O
, O
each O
with O
eight O
ovens O
, O
a O
similar O
construction O
to O
the O
one O
described O
above O
. O

The O
gas O
chambers O
were O
above O
- O
ground O
, O
the O
smaller O
three O
could O
contain O
about O
600 O
people O
. O

The O
two O
smallest O
crematoriums O
were O
much O
busier O
than O
the O
first O
two O
larger O
ones O
. O

Bodies O
were O
also O
burned O
on O
pyres O
. O

Victims O
were O
poisoned O
, O
the O
dead O
bodies O
were O
thrown O
out O
, O
the O
chambers O
were O
cleaned O
, O
and O
the O
gassing O
could O
continue O
on O
because O
the O
dead O
bodies O
were O
burned O
on O
pyres O
or O
pits O
in O
the O
meantime O
so O
that O
the O
ovens O
wouldn’t O
be O
overworked O
. O

The O
large O
crematoriums O
had O
one O
chimney O
, O
the O
smaller O
had O
two O
. O

The O
chimneys O
were O
badly O
built O
. O

The O
heat O
of O
the O
incinerated O
bodies O
was O
too O
intense O
and O
the O
chimneys O
cracked O
. O

Flames O
rose O
several O
meters O
above O
them O
. O

It O
was O
often O
necessary O
to O
repair O
the O
chimneys O
. O

They O
were O
pulled O
together O
with O
iron O
hoops O
. O

The O
four O
crematoriums O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
had O
46 O
ovens O
, O
each O
of O
which O
burned O
3 O
bodies O
in O
5 O
minutes O
. O

At O
the O

time O
, O
they O
burned O
5 O
bodies O
in O
a O
single O
oven O

they O
were O
only O
Jews O

and O
later O
also O
Russian B-LOC

had O
5 O
Polish B-LOC
political O

whose O
death O

was O
commuted O
to O
working O
in O
the O
Sonderkommando O

The O
Sonderkommando O
, O
i.e O

a O
special O
labor O
unit O
, O
was O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
were O
sentenced O
to O
do O
the O
worst O
and O
most O
vile O
work O
– O
exterminate O

and O
burn O
the O
dead O
bodies O
of O
innocent O
people O
, O
women O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
these O
people O
had O
to O
burn O
their O
own O
parents O
, O
wives O
, O
brothers O
. O

They O
were O
selected O
by O
camp O
commander O
Hans B-PERS
Schwarzhuber I-PERS
. O

Their O
work O
was O
to O
help O
the O
SS O
strip O
the O
people O
before O
entering O
the O
gas O
chambers O
, O
maintain O
order O
, O
sort O
, O
and O
pull O
out O
the O
dead O
bodies O
from O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

They O
brought O
the O
corpses O
to O
the O
ovens O
or O
piled O
them O
onto O
pyres O
, O
burned O
them O
, O
and O
removed O
the O
ashes O
. O

They O
cleaned O
the O
gas O
chambers O
and O
piled O
clothes O
, O
linens O
, O
shoes O
, O
and O
things O
the O
dead O
left O
behind O
onto O
cars O

They O
pulled O
gold O
teeth O
from O
the O
dead O
bodies O
, O
something O
the O
prisoners O
- O
doctors O
in O
this O
labor O
unit O
did O
as O
well O
. O

The O
prisoners O
were O
forced O
to O
do O
this O
work O
or O
they O
would O
be O
harshly O
punished O
. O

Before O
being O
burned O
, O
the O
mouth O
of O
each O
dead O
body O
was O
searched O
by O
SS O
- O
men O
and O
for O
each O
overlooked O
tooth O
the O
doctor O
in O
question O
would O
be O
punished O
by O
receiving O
25 O
lashes O
with O
the O
bullwhip O
. O

The O
teeth O
were O
thrown O
into O
closed O
boxes O
and O
were O
later O
cleaned O
and O
melted O
into O
gold O
cubes O
weighing O
half O
a O
kilo O
. O

This O
work O
was O
done O
by O
two O
dental O
technicians O
, O
Katz B-PERS
and O
Feldmann B-PERS
, O
who O
were O
shut O
in O
a O
specially O
guarded O
room O

The O
teeth O
were O
melted O
down O
with O
a O
tinsmith O
’s O
gasoline O
lamp O
in O
fireclay O
molds O
. O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1944 B-DATE
, O
Feldmann B-PERS
told O
us O
that O
2,000 O
kg O
of O
gold O
had O
been O
melted O
down O
during O
this O
time O
. O

Every O
Tuesday O
, O
a O
superior O
SS O
officer O
arrived O
by O
car O
to O
check O
the O
process O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
would O
take O
some O
of O
the O
gold O
away O
with O
him O
. O

The O
Sonderkommando O
was O
isolated O
from O
the O
other O
prisoners O
and O
all O
other O
prisoners O
were O
forbidden O
to O
have O
any O
contact O
with O
them O
. O

The O
sick O
were O
treated O
in O
their O

had O
their O

The O
work O
had O
a O
destructive O
effect O
on O
people O

mental O
state O

They O
felt O
numb O
, O
lost O
all O

and O
even O
their O
bodies O
changed O

They O
all O
resembled O
one O

Each O

everything O

The O

didn’t O
even O
object O

The O
maximum O
number O
of O
Sonderkommando O

it O
depended O
on O
the O

workshop O
. O

We O
knew O
about O
every O
transport O
and O
the O
details O
of O
the O
extermination O
. O

When O
new O
people O
were O
recruited O
into O
the O
Sonderkommando O
and O
found O
out O
what O
they O
had O
to O
do O
, O
they O
mentally O
collapsed O
and O
refused O
to O
work O
. O

They O
hurled O
themselves O
voluntarily O
into O
the O
gas O
chambers O
or O
chose O
death O
by O
shooting O
so O
that O
they O
wouldn’t O
have O
to O
do O
this O
horrible O
work O
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
crematorium O
, O
Moll B-PERS
, O
threw O
them O
into O
the O
fire O
while O
they O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

He O
punished O
those O
who O
attempted O
suicide O
by O
placing O
the O
prisoners O
’ O
bodies O
half O
in O
the O
oven O
and O
half O
out O
. O

He O
would O
then O
shut O
the O
oven O
door O
. O

This O
is O
how O
he O
scared O
them O
and O
threatened O
that O
this O
would O
happen O
to O
anyone O
who O
wouldn’t O
work O
. O

Other O
times O
, O
he O
poured O
gasoline O
on O
a O
prisoner O
’ O
s O
clothes O
, O
set O
him O
on O
fire O
, O
and O
chased O
him O
around O
the O
courtyard O
of O
the O
crematorium O
until O
the O
poor O
soul O
jumped O
onto O
the O
electrified O
barbed O
wires O
, O
where O
he O
was O
shot O
for O
running O
away O
. O

Moll B-PERS
was O
often O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
when O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O

Usually O
, O
he O
would O
show O
off O
his O
skill O
with O
a O
firearm O
. O

He O
would O
shoot O
at O
the O
lit O
end O
of O
a O
cigarette O
that O
a O
prisoner O
had O
to O
hold O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O

He O
would O
shoot O
with O
his O
back O
turned O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
target O
in O
a O
mirror O
. O

He O
was O
also O
the O
main O
and O
the O
most O
talented O
master O
executioner O
. O

I O
didn’t O
care O
whether O
he O
shot O
Jews O
or O
Germans B-LOC
, O
Poles B-LOC
, O
or O
Russians B-LOC
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
SS O
would O
conduct O
their O
black O
justice O
sessions O
in O
the O
crematoriums O
and O
sentenced O
their O
own O
people O
– O
officers O
and O
soldiers O
from O
the O
front O
, O
civilians O
, O
and O
anyone O
else O
that O
had O
become O
inconvenient O
. O

Moll B-PERS
performed O
the O
executions O
in O
the O
execution O
chamber O
. O

Executions O
by O
lethal O
injection O
were O
done O
in O
the O

The O
death O
of O
Rapportführer O
Schillinger B-PERS
. O

Shortly O
after O
Italy B-LOC
was O
occupied O
, O
a O
transport O
of O
2,000 O
interned O
American B-LOC
Jews O
arrived O
. O

They O
were O
lured O
from O
Italy B-LOC
and O
told O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
Switzerland B-LOC
in O
order O
to O
resettle O
there O
and O
would O
be O
exchanged O
for O
German B-LOC
POWs O
. O

In O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
they O
sent O
all O
of O
them O
straight O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

In O
the O
crematorium O
where O
women O
were O
gassed O
, O
SS O
- O
man O
Schillinger B-PERS
, O
the O
famous O
and O
cruelest O
guard O
, O
was O
on O
duty O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
entertain O
himself O
by O
ordering O
a O
certain O
actress O
who O
stood O
before O
him O
half O
- O
naked O
to O
take O
off O
her O
bra O
. O

She O
took O
it O
off O
and O
quickly O
threw O
it O
at O
him O
. O

In O
a O
flash O
, O
she O
ripped O
his O
gun O
out O
of O
his O
hand O
, O
fatally O
shot O
Schillinger B-PERS
in O
the O
stomach O
, O
and O
severely O
injured O
another O
SS O
- O
man O
( O
Emerich B-PERS
) O
. O

She O
thus O
saved O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
prisoners O
from O
this O
rabid O
dog O
. O

Another O
incident O
took O
place O
by O
the O
Vizsla B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

The O
river O
was O
about O
6 O
km O
from O
the O
camp O
. O

Prisoners O
in O
the O
Sonderkommando O
shoveled O
ashes O
out O
of O
the O
crematoriums O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 B-DATE
, O
a O
certain O
Greek B-LOC
suddenly O
struck O
one O
of O
the O
accompanying O
SS O
guards O
with O
a O
shovel O
three O
times O
in O
the O
head O
and O
after O
each O
blow O
cried O
out O
: O
This O
is O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
this O
is O
for O
my O
father O
, O
this O
is O
for O
my O
brother O
. O

He O
grabbed O
hold O
of O
his O
gun O
, O
swam O
across O
the O
Vizsla B-LOC
, O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

He O
was O
later O
caught O
and O
tortured O
. O

How O
they O
got O
rid O
of O
witnesses O
from O
the O
crematoriums O
: O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1944 B-DATE
, O
150 O
members O
of O
the O
Sonderkommando O
were O
sent O
to O
Lublin B-CAMP
in O
passenger O
cars O
. O

They O
were O
told O
by O
the O
camp O
commander O
that O
they O
were O
going O
there O
for O
work O
and O
would O
later O
return O
. O

After O
the O
Lublin B-CAMP
camp O
was O
liquidated O
, O
as O
the O
Lublin B-CAMP
prisoners O
have O
told O
us O
, O
all O
150 O
of O
them O
were O
immediately O
killed O
upon O
arrival O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
300 O
well O
nourished O
young O
girls O
from O
Lublin B-CAMP
arrived O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

They O
had O
been O
employed O
in O
a O
very O
good O
labor O
unit O
and O
were O
taken O
away O
before O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
Lublin B-CAMP
camp O
. O

In O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
nobody O
knew O
what O
to O
do O
with O
them O
. O

They O
waited O
in O
isolation O
in O
a O
block O
for O
several O
days O
, O
and O
then O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
crematorium O
. O

Camp O
Commander O
Hans B-PERS
Schwarzhuber I-PERS
, O
an O
SS O
officer O
, O
builder O
, O
and O
commander O
of O
the O
Birkenau B-CAMP
camp O
, O
is O
interesting O
because O
the O
man O
participated O
and O
was O
highly O
involved O
in O
the O
killing O
. O

It O
will O
remain O
a O
characteristic O
German B-LOC
trait O
that O
first O
a O
German O
destroys O
people O
with O
tricks O
and O
false O
pretenses O
and O
then O
once O
he O
has O
been O
found O
out O
, O
he O
can O
send O
any O
number O
of O
people O
to O
their O
deaths O
with O
systematic O
brutality O
. O

Hans B-PERS
Schwarzhuber I-PERS
was O
a O
product O
of O
the O
world O
of O
the O
Nazi O
concentration O
camps O
. O

He O
worked O
his O
way O
up O
from O
a O
rank O
- O
and O
- O
file O
SS O
- O
man O
to O
a O
Blockführer O
. O

Many O
older O
prisoners O
remember O
him O
from O
the O
Sachsenhausen B-CAMP
- O
Oranienburg B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
. O

Birkenau B-CAMP
was O
the O
life O
’s O
work O
of O
this O
Bavarian B-LOC
. O

He O
first O
worked O
as O
a O
Rapportführer O
with O
the O
rank O
of O
a O
non O
- O
commissioned O
officer O
, O
but O
for O
his O
success O
in O
building O
Birkenau B-CAMP
he O
was O
elevated O
to O
officer O
status O
and O
soon O
became O
the O
Obersturmführer O
- O
camp O
commander O
- O
Lagerführer O
. O

Under O
his O
leadership O
, O
the O
camp O
reached O
its O
peak O
in O
terms O
of O
size O
– O
100,000 O
prisoners O
– O
and O
the O
maximum O
record O
of O
killings O
was O
achieved O
– O
30,000 O
people O
in O
24 O
hours O
. O

He O
diplomatically O
connected O
all O
of O
the O
means O
of O
cunning O
and O
cruelty O
. O

He O
knew O
how O
to O
pick O
his O
collaborators O
from O
the O
population O
of O
prisoners O
, O
and O
they O
worked O
with O
enthusiasm O
on O
tasks O
that O
ultimately O
led O
to O
the O
extermination O
of O
people O
. O

Schwarzhüber B-PERS
knew O
very O
well O
and O
understood O
how O
disenfranchised O
people O
are O
ambitious O
and O
desire O
a O
career O
. O

He O
understood O
the O
mentality O
of O
green O
Germans B-LOC
, O
criminals O
, O
and O
fascist O
Polish B-LOC
functionaries O
who O
tried O
at O
all O
costs O
to O
stand O
out O
, O
control O
others O
, O
and O
became O
drunk O
with O
power O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
surrounded O
himself O
with O
a O
pack O
of O
small O
hitlers O
, O
who O
fought O
amongst O
themselves O
to O
gain O
the O
favor O
of O
their O
beloved O
Lagerführer O
. O

To O
achieve O
this O
goal O
, O
these O
prisoners O
- O
functionaries O
used O
any O
means O
necessary O
without O
any O
regard O
for O
the O
health O
and O
lives O
of O
their O
fellow O
prisoners O
. O

It O
was O
unbelievable O
how O
these O
prisoners O
forgot O
about O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
and O
life O
beyond O
the O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
made O
them O
identify O
with O
their O
new O
roles O
and O
consider O
their O
camp O
activities O
as O
their O
ultimate O
life O
’s O
mission O
. O

He O
constantly O
emphasized O
that O
their O
collaboration O
proved O
how O
much O
they O
understood O
the O
Nazi O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

It O
was O
also O
a O
determining O
factor O
in O
the O
earlier O
and O
often O
promised O
release O
from O
the O
camp O
. O

While O
they O
were O
mere O
puppets O
in O
a O
temporary O
game O
, O
they O
thought O
in O
all O
seriousness O
that O
they O
were O
above O
all O
of O
the O
other O
prisoners O
. O

The O
German B-LOC
ubermensch O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
created O
fascist O
super O
- O
prisoners O
out O
of O
inferior O
creatures O
. O

The O
absolute O
lowest O
level O
of O
human O
society O
– O
thieves O
, O
pimps O
, O
prosperous O
fascists O
– O
outdid O
one O
another O
in O
terms O
of O
following O
orders O
. O

They O
fulfilled O
the O
Nazi O
program O
of O
expanding O
Germanness B-LOC
and O
helped O
with O
the O
extermination O
of O
everything O
non B-LOC
- I-LOC
German I-LOC
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
also O
influenced O
his O
collaborators O
politically O
. O

In O
conversations O
with O
individuals O
or O
lectures O
to O
groups O
of O
kapos O
and O
head O
prisoners O
, O
he O
emphasized O
their O
superiority O
and O
primacy O
over O
the O
lower O
Jews O
, O
Poles B-LOC
, O
and O
Russians B-LOC
. O

He O
knew O
how O
to O
use O
national O
conflicts O
for O
his O
own O
purposes O
. O

He O
maintained O
a O
constant O
tension O
in O
the O
camp O
between O
the O
races O
. O

He O
pitched O
Poles B-LOC
against O
Russians B-LOC
, O
of O
whom O
he O
was O
afraid O
. O

He O
boldly O
promised O
that O
the O
Russian B-LOC
advance O
would O
stop O
in O
Bug O
. O

The O
Bolsheviks O
would O
never O
reach O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

In O
the O
spring O
of O
1944 B-DATE
, O
panic O
broke O
out O
among O
the O
old O
Jewish O
, O
especially O
political O
, O
prisoners O
. O

The O
people O
selected O
to O
be O
gassed O
were O
so O
numerous O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
end O
of O
all O
of O
the O
Jewish O
- O
labelled O
prisoners O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
the O
opportunity O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
camp O
. O

All O
of O
the O
prisoners O
who O
had O
been O
in O
the O
camp O
for O
a O
long O
time O
were O
preparing O
to O
escape O
. O

Even O
the O
threat O
that O
for O
each O
Jew O
who O
escaped O
10 O
prisoners O
from O
the O
labor O
unit O
would O
be O
shot O
didn’t O
help O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
again O
chose O
to O
act O
diplomatically O
. O

One O
night O
, O
he O
called O
the O
Jewish O
kapo O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
Josef B-PERS
Baumann I-PERS
, O
to O
his O
office O
at O
night O
and O
ordered O
him O
to O
calm O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

He O
assured O
him O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
more O
selections O
of O
prisoners O
from O
the O
camp O
to O
be O
gassed O
. O

In O
the O
interest O
of O
maintaining O
peace O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
promise O
for O
several O
months O
, O
which O
was O
easy O
since O
the O
crematoriums O
were O
so O
busy O
with O
the O
arriving O
transports O
that O
they O
barely O
managed O
to O
process O
the O
large O
amount O
of O
victims O
. O

Just O
like O
Hitler B-PERS
never O
kept O
his O
promise O
on O
the O
international O
stage O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
Birkenau B-CAMP
camp O
was O
the O
same O
such O
deceptive O
German B-LOC
. O

He O
personally O
assured O
the O
prisoners O
who O
were O
considered O
unable O
to O
work O
that O
they O
would O
go O
to O
the O
sanatorium O
. O

He O
gave O
them O
his O
word O
that O
they O
wouldn’t O
go O
to O
the O
crematorium O
. O

To O
support O
his O
claim O
, O
he O
ordered O
a O
special O
ration O
of O
bread O
to O
be O
given O
to O
them O
. O

This O
was O
at O
a O
time O
when O
they O
were O
all O
concentrated O
in O
block O
no O
. O

20 O
, O
awaiting O
the O
arrival O
of O
cars O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
prisoners O
, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
and O
SS O
members O
armed O
to O
the O
teeth O
, O
were O
loaded O
into O
the O
cars O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
acquired O
popularity O
with O
underhanded O
tricks O
, O
especially O
with O
newcomers O
. O

He O
pardoned O
prisoners O
who O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
beg O
him O
not O
to O
send O
them O
to O
be O
gassed O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
for O
him O
to O
oblige O
them O
since O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
only O
going O
to O
put O
them O
off O
until O
the O
next O
selection O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
honored O
his O
collaborators O
with O
petty O
benefits O
, O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
received O
them O
felt O
very O
proud O
. O

One O
day O
, O
he O
honored O
5 O
new O
Germans B-LOC
whose O
mothers O
spoke O
Polish B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
camp O
they O
requested O
to O
be O
admitted O
into O
the O
Volksdeutscher O
group O
for O
their O
faithful O
and O
successful O
service O
in O
leading O
the O
camp O
and O
building O
it O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
, O
before O
an O
assembly O
of O
all O
prisoners O
announced O
that O
they O
had O
become O
premier O
prisoners O
( O
bevorzugte O
Häftlinge O
) O
. O

They O
could O
let O
their O
hair O
grow O
out O
, O
they O
received O
food O
from O
the O
SS O
kitchen O
and O
, O
among O
countless O
other O
benefits O
, O
a O
blind O
eye O
was O
turned O
to O
their O
transgressions O
, O
such O
as O
drunkenness O
, O
organizing O
, O
etc O
. O

Another O
of O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
’ O
s O
methods O
was O
to O
spread O
various O
news O
through O
the O
grapevine O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
was O
to O
divert O
prisoners O
’ O
attention O
away O
from O
reality O
. O

It O
was O
often O
rumored O
that O
gassing O
was O
truly O
stopped O
, O
that O
Berlin B-LOC
officially O
ordered O
the O
demolition O
of O
the O
crematoriums O
, O
there O
was O
talk O
of O
various O
transports O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
final O
days O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
realized O
that O
the O
end O
was O
near O
and O
was O
almost O
constantly O
drunk O
. O

Faithful O
prisoners O
and O
his O
confidants O
procured O
alcohol O
and O
valuable O
items O
for O
him O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
when O
gassing O
stopped O
, O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Buchberg B-LOC
camp O
by O
Dachau B-CAMP
, O
where O
his O
job O
was O
to O
manage O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
new O
camp O
. O

As O
we O
learned O
from O
our O
friends O
, O
he O
was O
captured O
there O
by O
the O
American B-LOC

How O
People O
Were O
Transported O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
Extermination O
transports O
were O
brought O
by O
trains O
from O
all O
over O
Europe O
. O

Several O
days O
before O
the O
transport O
, O
there O
were O
rumors O
that O
a O
French B-LOC
, O
Dutch B-LOC
, O
Czech B-LOC
etc O
. O

transport O
was O
coming O
. O

These O
rumors O
generally O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
true O
. O

The O
management O
of O
the O
transports O
and O
orders O
to O
exterminate O
them O
was O
the O
domain O
of O
the O
RSHA B-ORG
( O
Reichssicherheitshauptamt B-ORG
) O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
directly O
subordinate O
to O
Himmler B-PERS
. O

One O
of O
its O
leaders O
was O
SS O
- O
Oberführer O
Eichmann B-PERS
. O

The O
trains O
arrived O
at O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
train O
station O
and O
were O
moved O
to O
a O
special O
ramp O
. O

This O
ramp O
was O
used O
for O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
II I-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Birkenau I-CAMP
until O
June B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
. O

When O
the O
transport O
arrived O
, O
usually O
with O
50 O
- O
70 O
train O
cars O
, O
it O
would O
be O
immediately O
surrounded O
by O
many O
SS O
guards O
with O
dogs O
and O
then O
the O
labor O
unit O
( O
Aufräumungskomando O
) O
called O
Canada O
composed O
of O
prisoners O
dressed O
in O
striped O
prisoner O
uniforms O
would O
approach O
. O

The O
cattle O
cars O
were O
opened O
and O
people O
were O
quickly O
chased O
out O
of O
them O
, O
creating O
chaos O
and O
confusion O
. O

The O
task O
of O
Canada O
was O
to O
quickly O
unload O
the O
luggage O
that O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
prisoners O
, O
except O
for O
women O
’s O
purses O
. O

They O
were O
told O
that O
their O
luggage O
would O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
camp O
later O
. O

The O
ones O
who O
refused O
to O
relinquish O
their O
luggage O
had O
it O
taken O
away O
by O
force O
. O

The O
SS O
had O
total O
control O
over O
prisoners O
, O
who O
were O
forbidden O
to O
speak O
even O
a O
word O
to O
the O
newly O
arrived O
people O
lest O
they O
be O
punished O
by O
being O
immediately O
shot O
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
their O
own O
family O
members O
were O
among O
those O
who O
had O
just O
arrived O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
a O
prisoner O
happened O
to O
be O
working O
in O
the O
Canada O
team O
that O
was O
processing O
the O
transport O
that O
his O
own O
mother O
arrived O
on O
, O
but O
he O
was O
powerless O
and O
had O
to O
participate O
and O
help O
bury O
his O
own O
mother O
alive O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
especially O
among O
the O
Polish B-LOC
transports O
, O
those O
arriving O
knew O
what O
awaited O
them O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

They O
would O
ask O
: O
Are O
we O
going O
to O
the O
chimney O
? O
Are O
we O
going O
to O
the O
oven O
? O
etc O
. O

When O
all O
had O
disembarked O
from O
the O
cars O
, O
men O
were O
forced O
to O
stand O
on O
one O
side O
, O
and O
women O
and O
children O
on O
the O
other O
. O

Men O
were O
selected O
by O
an O
SS O
- O
officer O
and O
an O
SS O
- O
doctor O
, O
who O
simply O
and O
quickly O
examined O
each O
of O
them O
and O
, O
based O
on O
their O
superficial O
assessment O
, O
or O
depending O
on O
the O
prisoner O
’s O
profession O
, O
would O
point O
his O
thumb O
to O
the O
right O
or O
to O
the O
left O
– O
life O
or O
death O
. O

Women O
and O
the O
children O
who O
didn’t O
want O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
them O
were O
killed O
without O
exception O
. O

From O
the O
remaining O
women O
, O
they O
selected O
the O
young O
, O
healthy O
, O
aged O
16 O
to O
30 O
years O
old O
, O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
the O
camp O
. O

Everyone O
else O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
. O

The O
average O
percentage O
of O
those O
who O
were O
selected O
for O
the O
camp O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
able O
to O
work O
, O
was O
about O
15 O
to O
20 O
% O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
selected O
to O
be O
gassed O
were O
loaded O
onto O
waiting O
trucks O
. O

Before O
they O
left O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
being O
taken O
to O
camps O
that O
were O
further O
away O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
anyone O
among O
that O
20 O
% O
wasn’t O
able O
to O
walk O
to O
the O
camp O
, O
they O
were O
invited O
to O
get O
on O
the O
trucks O
as O
well O
. O

We O
can O
never O
forget O
the O
images O
we O
saw O
, O
the O
multitudes O
stuffed O
into O
the O
overfilled O
trucks O
making O
their O
way O
at O
full O
speed O
towards O
the O
crematorium O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
warn O
them O
about O
what O
awaited O
them O
with O
words O
or O
signs O
, O
because O
it O
was O
better O
for O
them O
not O
to O
know O
. O

The O
SS O

the O
secret O
of O
Birkenau B-CAMP
An O
incident O
occurred O
, O
during O
which O
a O
hungry O

called O
out O

its O

victims O
: O
Toss O

it O

for O
the O

, O
during O

that O

, O
as O
well O

an O

with O
a O

give O
people O
the O
impression O
that O

The O

it O

A O
sidetrack O
was O
laid O
from O
the O

station O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
which O
went O
through O
a O
tunnel O
from O

through O
the O
electrified O

between O
the O
men O

up O

at O
a O

it O
had O
to O
be O
under O
quarantine O
for O
6 O
months O
. O

Older O
people O
suffered O
greatly O
and O
died O
quickly O
of O
natural O
causes O
, O
hastened O
by O
poor O
hygienic O
conditions O
and O
malnutrition O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
enter O
the O
camp O
under O
the O
pretense O
of O
necessary O
locksmith O
and O
plumbing O
work O
. O

There O
, O
one O
of O
the O
writers O
found O
his O
own O
wife O
and O
child O
and O
saw O
them O
again O
for O
the O
first O
time O
after O
three O
years O
of O
imprisonment O
. O

We O
let O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
camp O
know O
what O
was O
happening O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

They O
didn’t O
believe O
us O
at O
first O
, O
but O
later O
when O
they O
saw O
for O
themselves O
how O
people O
were O
killed O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
they O
became O
convinced O
that O
Czech B-LOC
Jews O
had O
a O
special O
position O
. O

It O
was O
suspicious O
that O
none O
of O
the O
prisoners O
from O
the O
surrounding O
camps O
was O
allowed O
into O
the O
camp O
except O
in O
emergency O
situations O
. O

The O
SS O
took O
great O
pains O
to O
hide O
the O
fact O
that O
people O
were O
being O
gassed O
and O
burned O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

One O
of O
the O
first O
measures O
that O
the O
political O
division O
led O
by O
the O
infamous O
Grabner B-PERS
realized O
was O
to O
immediately O
write O
letters O
with O
the O
famous O
lines O
: O
... O
I O
am O
healthy O
and O
doing O
well O
… O
with O
the O
address O
Arbeitslager O
Birkenau B-CAMP
bei O
Neu O
Berun O
. O

Everyone O
had O
to O
write O
at O
least O
one O
letter O
, O
but O
could O
send O
five O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
elsewhere O
. O

It O
was O
permitted O
to O
send O
packages O
, O
which O
also O
began O
to O
arrive O
in O
greater O
numbers O
. O

At O
one O
time O
, O
the O
Czech O
camp O
received O
up O
to O
a O
thousand O
packages O
a O
day O
from O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
Moravia B-LOC
. O

These O
packages O
helped O
the O
camp O
’ O
s O
inhabitants O
very O
much O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
improved O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

Children O
and O
pregnant O
women O
received O
special O
care O
. O

They O
were O
given O
better O
food O
, O
butter O
, O
and O
white O
bread O
. O

Children O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
special O
block O
. O

During O
the O
day O
, O
they O
spent O
their O
time O
in O
a O
children O
’s O
home O
that O
was O
run O
by O
Fredy B-PERS
Hirsch I-PERS
. O

The O
block O
was O
tastefully O
and O
artistically O
fixed O
up O
by O
the O
people O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
children O
performed O
theater O
plays O
and O
their O
lessons O
were O
taught O
in O
Czech B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
evenings O
, O
camp O
music O
concerts O
and O
theater O
performances O
were O
held O
. O

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
and O
other O
SS O
personnel O
would O
be O
in O
attendance O
. O

Two O
blocks O
were O
turned O
into O
a O
hospital O
. O

Doctors O
, O
professors O
, O
teachers O
, O
physicians O
, O
and O
medical O
staff O
were O
selected O
to O
work O
there O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
, O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
in O
this O
camp O
seemed O
to O
be O
much O
better O
than O
in O
the O
other O
camps O
due O
to O
the O
hard O
work O
of O
the O
people O
in O
charge O
. O

Unlike O
in O
the O
other O
camps O
, O
they O
didn’t O
beat O
people O
to O
death O
, O
didn’t O
torture O
or O
torment O
their O
fellow O
prisoners O
, O
but O
accommodated O
them O
and O
helped O
them O
. O

The O
only O
exception O
was O
the O
head O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
murderer O
Arno B-PERS
Böhm I-PERS
, O
who O
needlessly O
prolonged O
roll O
calls O
, O
bullied O
, O
and O
tortured O
people O
in O
typical O
concentration O
camp O
ways O
. O

On O
December B-DATE
20th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
another O
5,000 O
people O
arrived O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

The O
camp O
was O
full O
. O

They O
were O
treated O
like O
the O
previous O
arrivals O
. O

With O
no O
exceptions O
, O
they O
were O
all O
sent O
to O
the O
camp O
, O
tattooed O
, O
and O
accepted O
. O

For O
the O
bandit O
Böhm B-PERS
and O
his O
Rapportführer O
Buntrock B-PERS
, O
this O
was O
a O
unique O
opportunity O
to O
plunder O
their O
belongings O
. O

They O
closely O
inspected O
the O
prisoners O
and O
took O
away O
all O
of O
their O
valuables O
. O

Their O
bounty O
allowed O
them O
to O
stay O
drunk O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
elder O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
and O
his O
closest O
coworkers O
were O
on O
the O
transports O
that O
arrived O
on O
December B-DATE
20th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1943 I-DATE
. O

Immediately O
after O
they O
arrived O
, O
they O
were O
separated O
from O
their O
families O
and O
imprisoned O
in O
the O
jail O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
I I-CAMP
, O
block O
II O
. O

This O
camp O
was O
supplied O
with O
medicine O
and O
had O
a O
pharmacy O
. O

Doctors O
were O
forced O
to O
collaborate O
scientifically O
with O
SS O
doctors O
and O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
all O
colleagues O
. O

An O
SS O
doctor O
would O
often O
visit O
the O
children O
’s O
home O
and O
ask O
about O
the O
children O
’ O
s O
health O
and O
praise O
how O
well O
their O
education O
and O
care O
was O
organized O
. O

It O
created O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
SS O
was O
truly O
interested O
in O
the O
successful O
development O
of O
the O
camp O
. O

Once O
, O
Fredy B-PERS
Hirsch I-PERS
was O
asked O
to O
write O
an O
objective O
report O
about O
the O
camp O
with O
a O
special O
focus O
on O
childcare O
, O
which O
was O
sent O
to O
Switzerland B-LOC
. O

An O
interesting O
and O
mysterious O
event O
was O
the O
visit O
of O
a O
superior O
officer O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
from O
Oberführer O
Eichmann B-PERS
’ O
s O
RSHA B-ORG
, O
who O
was O
supposedly O
charged O
with O
solving O
the O
Jewish O
question O
in O
the O
Reich O
. O

His O
visit O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
the O
SS O
was O
very O
interested O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

But O
those O
who O
knew O
him O
from O
their O
time O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
( O
like O
Dr O
. O

Janovitz B-PERS
claimed O
that O
bad O
things O
always O
happened O
after O
he O
would O
visit O
. O

- O
The O
transport O
to O
Heydebreck B-LOC
: O
on O
March B-DATE
2nd I-DATE
, I-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
letters O
were O
handed O
out O
and O
people O
were O
ordered O
to O
write O
the O
date O
March B-DATE
25th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1944 I-DATE
on O
them O
. O

Apparently O
, O
this O
was O
how O
long O
it O
took O
for O
the O
letters O
to O
be O
censored O
before O
they O
were O
sent O
. O

On O
about O
March B-DATE
4th I-DATE
, O
we O
started O
hearing O
about O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
camp O
since O
the O
6 O
month O
quarantine O
was O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

On O
March B-DATE
5th I-DATE
, O
commander O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
came O
to O
the O
camp O
’ O
s O
writing O
room O
in O
person O
and O
announced O
that O
part O
of O
the O
camp O
would O
be O
transported O
, O
specifically O
all O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
September O
transport O
from O
the O
previous O
year O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
he O
came O
to O
the O
camp O
at O
night O
in O
a O
state O
of O
drunkenness O
and O
demanded O
to O
be O
shown O
naked O
women O
. O

He O
announced O
that O
they O
would O
go O
to O
Heydebreck B-LOC
in O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia B-LOC
. O

He O
ordered O
the O
writing O
room O
to O
prepare O
a O
list O
of O
all O
the O
members O
of O
the O
September O
transport O
, O
which O
was O
the O
usual O
way O
to O
get O
ready O
for O
a O
transport O
. O

He O
remarked O
that O
prisoners O
who O
were O
also O
functionaries O
should O
be O
highlighted O
on O
the O
list O
because O
they O
would O
keep O
their O
functions O
in O
the O
new O
camp O
. O

We O
suspected O
that O
something O
fishy O
was O
underfoot O
, O
because O
they O
never O
transported O
children O
or O
women O
with O
children O
. O

The O
same O
day O
, O
we O
learned O
a O
confidential O
terrible O
fact O
. O

Kateřina B-PERS
Singerová I-PERS
, O
the O
secretary O
of O
the O
head O
SS O
female O
guard O
, O
accidentally O
overheard O
a O
telephone O
call O
between O
SS O
officers O
and O
Berlin B-LOC
that O
ordered O
to O
directly O
proceed O
to O
SB O
, O
i.e O
. O

Sonderbehandlung O
– O
the O
entire O
September O
transport O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
. O

The O
officers O
hesitated O
in O
carrying O
out O
this O
order O
, O
because O
even O
for O
them O
this O
was O
too O
much O
– O
killing O
all O
at O
once O
so O
many O
innocent O
, O
young O
, O
and O
healthy O
people O
that O
they O
had O
gotten O
used O
to O
seeing O
around O
and O
whose O
advanced O
culture O
and O
way O
of O
life O
they O
respected O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, O
Hessler B-PERS
, O
proposed O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
that O
at O
least O
the O
able O
bodied O
men O
and O
women O
who O
worked O
and O
were O
needed O
in O
the O
camp O
should O
be O
spared O
. O

For O
his O
efforts O
, O
he O
was O
immediately O
disciplined O
and O
punished O
, O
and O
Schwarzhuber B-PERS
received O
an O
order O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
original O
order O
to O
the O
letter O
. O

We O
let O
the O
leaders O
and O
capable O
people O
in O
the O
Czech B-LOC
camp O
know O
, O
and O
they O
couldn’t O
believe O
it O
. O

They O
couldn’t O
understand O
this O
coming O
danger O
when O
they O
had O
a O
special O
status O
and O
benefited O
from O
exceptions O
that O
others O
didn’t O
receive O
. O

On O
March B-DATE

Schwarzhuber B-PERS
ordered O
all O
members O
of O
the O
September O
transport O
( O
about O
3,800 O
people O
) O
to O
be O
transferred O
to O
neighboring O
camp O

He O
again O
emphasized O
and O
assured O
that O
this O
was O
a O
labor O
transport O
to O
a O
new O
family O
camp O
in O
Heydebreck B-LOC

They O
were O
to O
take O
packages O
, O
food O
, O
blankets O
, O
etc O
. O

with O
them O
. O

He O
requested O
the O
head O
functionary O
to O
confirm O
his O
statement O
to O
his O
fellow O
prisoners O
and O
calm O
people O
down O
. O

He O
reiterated O
that O
only O
the O
healthy O
would O
be O
departing O

the O
sick O
and O
elderly O
would O
remain O
in O

that O

I O
ask O
you O

that O
all O

a O
Hungarian B-LOC

… O
We O
often O
asked O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
who O
arrived O
in O

whether O
they O
had O
heard O
the O
news O
from O

on O
the O

They O
answered O
that O
they O
considered O
the O
information O
to O
be O
mendacious O
propaganda O
. O

One O
even O
told O
us O
that O
a O
runaway O
from O
the O

camp O
had O
visited O
him O
and O
told O
him O
about O
the O

and O
burning O
of O

He O
thought O
the O
man O
was O
exaggerating O

and O
so O
he O
gave O
him O
some O
money O

was O
happy O

The O

The O

the O
deportation O
of O
Jews O
from O
Krakow B-LOC
was O
furnished O
in O
confidence O
by O
Jewish O
leaders O
at O
Warsaw B-LOC

The O
Jewish O
population O

Krakow B-LOC

totals O
some O
67,000 O
including O
about O
11,000 O
deportees O
who O
have O
recently O
arrived O
from O
Polish B-LOC
regions O
annexed O
to O

The O
deportation O
held O
in O
May B-DATE
will O
immediately O
affect O
a O
total O
of O
80,000 O
Jews O
and O
it O
cannot O
be O
regarded O
otherwise O
than O
a O
major O
disaster O
to O
Polish O
Jewry O
. O

The O
break O
up O
of O
the O
ancient O
, O
rich O
and O
powerful O
Jewish O
community O
at O
Krakow B-LOC
can O
bring O
nothing O
but O
destitution O
to O
its O
members O
who O
will O
be O
forced O
on O
short O
notice O
to O
emigrate O
without O

to O
such O
localities O
in O
the O
General O
Government O
as O
are O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
receive O
them O
. O

The O
Department B-ORG
is O
already O
aware O
that O
the O
military O
occupation O
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bucovina B-LOC
was O
followed O
by O
the O
establishment O
of O
Jews O
in O
ghettos O
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
and O
that O
large O
numbers O
, O
particularly O
from O
Bessarabia B-LOC
, O
were O
gradually O
evacuated O
into O
the O
territory O
lying O
beyond O
the O
Dniester B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

These O
measures O
were O
carried O
out O
under O
appalling O
conditions O
and O
accompanied O
by O
innumerable O
kinds O
of O
frightfulness O
, O
including O
robbery O
, O
starvation O
, O
killings O
and O
other O
brutalities O
. O

Only O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
Jews O
are O
believed O
now O
to O
be O
left O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
– O
estimates O
vary O
from O
ten O
to O
thirty O
thousand O
out O
of O
a O
total O
of O
just O
over O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
residing O
there O
prior O
to O
the O
Russian O
seizure O
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
in O
June B-DATE
1940 I-DATE
– O
while O
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
there O
are O
, O
according O
to O
reliable O
Jews O
, O
some O
fifteen O
to O
twenty O
thousand O
Jews O
now O
awaiting O
deportation O
eastward O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

A O
great O
many O
, O
undoubtedly O
tens O
of O
thousands O
, O
have O
already O
been O
thus O
evacuated O
. O

During O
the O
past O
three O
weeks O
evidence O
has O
been O
accumulating O
– O
first O
in O
the O
form O
of O
vague O
rumors O
and O
unconfirmed O
reports O
, O
then O
through O
increasingly O
substantial O
sources O
of O
information O
and O
finally O
in O
exchange O
of O
letters O
between O
Marshal O
Antonescu B-PERS
and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
local O
Jewish O
community O
– O
that O
such O
as O
remains O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
and O
Bessarabia B-LOC
is O
being O
evacuated O
eastward O
into O
the O
war O
- O
devastated O
territory O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
under O
conditions O
so O
appalling O
that O
they O
would O
seem O
to O
afford O
a O
substantial O
share O
of O
the O
evacuees O
little O
chance O
to O
survive O
. O

Persistent O
reports O
have O
reached O
me O
daily O
regarding O
these O
unfortunate O
people O
– O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
including O
the O
old O
and O
ill O
– O
who O
, O
given O
only O
a O
few O
hours O
notice O
with O
the O
right O
to O
take O
with O
them O
only O
a O
meager O
ten O
kilograms O
of O
belongings O
and O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O
dollars O
in O
money O
– O
the O
stories O
almost O
invariably O
add O
that O
these O
belongings O
and O
the O
money O
are O
taken O
from O
them O
en O
route O
– O
have O
been O
herded O
eastward O
on O
foot O
or O
in O
carts O
or O
box O
- O
cars O
, O
to O
war O
- O
swept O
regions O
where O
buildings O
have O
been O
razed O
and O
food O
and O
other O
supplies O
destroyed O
or O
removed O
and O
where O
winter O
weather O
will O
soon O
prevail O
. O

This O
modern O
Captivity O
would O
seem O
deliberately O
calculated O
to O
serve O
a O
program O
of O
virtual O
extermination O
and O
, O
even O
if O
the O
persistent O
rumors O
that O
the O
evacuees O
in O
numberless O
cases O
are O
plundered O
of O
their O
belongings O
, O
that O
dozens O
and O
hundreds O
are O
shot O
en O
route O
, O
pushed O
off O
bridges O
or O
dead O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
are O
greatly O
exaggerated O
or O
untrue O
, O
it O
seems O
certain O
that O
many O
thousands O
will O
perish O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
the O
last O
paragraph O
of O
my O
telegram O
first O
cited O
above O
, O
many O
of O
these O
reports O
and O
rumors O
are O
unconfirmed O
and O
must O
be O
classified O
as O
hearsay O
, O
or O
even O
propaganda O
by O
interested O
persons O
[ O
... O
] O
but O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
say O
that O
even O
the O
minimum O
of O
truth O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
lies O
in O
these O
stories O
is O
sufficient O
to O
give O
grave O
concern O

at O
6 O
a.m O

from O
Janovského B-LOC
Street I-LOC

. O

The O
two O
girls O
had O
been O
waiting O
with O
a O
pile O
of O
suitcases O
since O
6 O
a.m O
. O

Dr O
. O

Nasch B-PERS
appeared O
at O
6:45 O
because O
his O
alarm O
hadn’t O
gone O
off O
. O

At O
7:00 O
everyone O
was O
assembled O
, O
but O
we O
found O
out O
that O
a O
) O
Erich B-PERS
forgot O
the O
canister O
attachment O
. O

b O
) O
the O
girls O
have O
one O
more O
suitcase O
at O
the O
train O
station O
. O

We O
therefore O
drove O
to O
Střešovice B-LOC
to O
get O
the O
wire O
, O
but O
couldn’t O
attach O
the O
canister O
, O
and O
then O
went O
on O
to O
the O
train O
station O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
suitcase O
and O
the O
girls O
. O

With O
so O
many O
people O
around O
and O
much O
good O
advice O
proffered O
, O
the O
suitcases O
were O
attached O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
car O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
one O
of O
the O
passers O
- O
by O
had O
neither O
advice O
nor O
criticism O
to O
give O
— O
he O
was O
likely O
a O
German O
. O

At O
8:00 O
, O
we O
wished O
ourselves O
good O
luck O
and O
headed O
out O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
rain O
and O
slippery O
road O
, O
our O
overloaded O
car O
drove O
slowly O
but O
surely O
to O
the O
demarcation O
line O
, O
where O
neither O
the O
Russians B-LOC
nor O
the O
Americans B-LOC
took O
much O
notice O
of O
our O
papers O
and O
let O
us O
pass O
through O
smoothly O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Pilsen B-LOC
at O
10:00 O
. O

At O
the O
town O
hall O
, O
we O
immediately O
found O
out O
that O
travel O
permits O
are O
only O
issued O
by O
the O
US B-LOC
Embassy O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
told O
to O
contact O
the O
embassy O
and O
assured O
that O
we O
would O
get O
them O
. O

But O
they O
also O
told O
us O
of O
another O
option O
— O
apply O
to O
Frankfurt B-LOC
for O
an O
entry O
permit O
. O

It O
generally O
takes O
six O
weeks O
to O
get O
a O
reply O
and O
most O
applications O
are O
turned O
down O
, O
however O
, O
so O
we O
politely O
thanked O
them O
for O
their O
advice O
. O

By O
that O
point O
, O
we O
were O
fed O
up O
with O
all O
this O
bullshit O
. O

We O
left O
the O
sad O
girls O
at O
the O
train O
station O
, O
where O
they O
were O
barely O
visible O
under O
their O
pile O
of O
luggage O
and O
packages O
. O

We O
still O
don’t O
know O
if O
they O
made O
it O
to O
Deggendorf B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
would O
have O
loved O
to O
have O
driven O
them O
. O

In O
our O
desperation O
, O
we O
went O
to O
Vaňha O
's O
for O
some O
perch O
with O
caraway O
seeds O
, O
which O
consisted O
mostly O
of O
bones O
, O
with O
potato O
salad O
, O
pudding O
with O
nail O
polish O
, O
and O
pretty O
decent O
ducat O
buns O
. O

After O
lunch O
, O
we O
headed O
out O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Volary B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
weather O
had O
improved O
, O
the O
clouds O
had O
cleared O
up O
, O
our O
initial O
anger O
towards O
the O
Americans B-LOC
had O
abated O
, O
the O
sun O
was O
shining O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
through O
the O
autumn O
- O
colored O
, O
beautiful O
landscape O
of O
South B-LOC
Bohemia I-LOC
. O

Our O
mood O
had O
improved O
so O
much O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Nepomuk B-LOC
, O
Blatná B-LOC
, O
and O
Strakonice B-LOC
shook O
their O
heads O
at O
the O
two O
lurching O
and O
bellowing O
riders O
in O
the O
small O
green O
car O
. O

However O
, O
our O
mood O
soon O
worsened O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
state O
of O
the O
road O
. O

Between O
Volyně B-LOC
and O
Vimperk B-LOC
, O
Erich B-PERS
heard O
by O
auscultation O
the O
motor O
emitting O
strange O
sounds O
although O
its O
performance O
was O
unaffected O
. O

A O
short O
check O
revealed O
that O
the O
bolt O
that O
attaches O
the O
air O
filter O
to O
the O
gasifier O
was O
missing O
. O

A O
cosmetic O
insignificant O
matter O
, O
but O
one O
that O
we O
needed O
to O
have O
fixed O
in O
Vimperk B-LOC
. O

Once O
there O
, O
the O
local O
mechanics O
discovered O
many O
other O
problems O
that O
could O
have O
cost O
us O
our O
necks O
or O
even O
our O
lives O
. O

The O
old O
gasifier O
needed O
to O
be O
replaced O
with O
a O
new O
one O
because O
a O
piece O
of O
it O
had O
broken O
off O
, O
and O
the O
right O
front O
wheel O
had O
run O
out O
of O
bearings O
, O
meaning O
that O
the O
whole O
axle O
had O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

Luckily O
, O
they O
had O
one O
just O
like O
it O
, O
quickly O
replaced O
it O
, O
and O
stole O
about O
3 O
l O
of O
petrol O
from O
an O
American B-LOC
car O
for O
us O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Vinči B-PERS
had O
been O
searching O
all O
over O
town O
for O
the O
missing O
chairman O
of O
the O
National O
Committee O
, O
because O
we O
needed O
stamps O
for O
our O
petrol O
tickets O
since O
they O
couldn't O
pump O
any O
gas O
for O
us O
without O
them O
. O

He O
couldn’t O
find O
him O
, O
and O
so O
we O
drove O
on O
without O
getting O
any O
gas O
. O

It O
was O
already O
dark O
when O
we O
drove O
the O
last O
leg O
of O
the O
journey O
to O
Volary B-LOC
. O

We O
gave O
a O
lift O
to O
an O
American B-LOC
soldier O
, O
earning O
Vinči B-PERS
one O
cigarette O
. O

In O
Volary B-LOC
, O
we O
went O
to O
a O
German B-LOC
hotel O
, O
duly O
checked O
in O
, O
and O
then O
quickly O
ran O
away O
and O
went O
to O
the O
Czech B-LOC
competition O
across O
the O
street O
. O

We O
got O
lucky O
, O
because O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
a O
lively O
black O
market O
was O
being O
held O
there O
. O

Apparently O
, O
foreign O
elements O
from O
all O
sides O
had O
swooped O
down O
with O
offers O
and O
requests O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
buy O
a O
tractor O
and O
a O
car O
from O
us O
and O
offered O
us O
various O
goods O
in O
exchange O
, O
starting O
with O
cigarettes O
, O
but O
our O
wonderful O
army O
offered O
us O
surprisingly O
cheap O
petrol O
in O
any O
quantity O
. O

And O
so O
we O
purchased O
, O
under O
adventurous O
circumstances O
, O
as O
much O
gas O
and O
oil O
as O
we O
could O
fit O
in O
the O
car O
, O
in O
other O
words O
as O
much O
as O
we O
could O
get O
out O
of O
our O
pockets O
. O

We O
only O
ate O
two O
soups O
and O
bread O
for O
dinner O
, O
but O
the O
deal O
we O
had O
just O
made O
on O
the O
gas O
had O
left O
us O
thoroughly O
satisfied O
. O

We O
had O
a O
beautiful O
double O
bedroom O
with O
three O
windows O
and O
three O
doors O
and O
pink O
lacquered O
furniture O
. O

By O
9:00 O
we O
were O
already O
fast O
asleep O
, O
tracing O
our O
grand O
plans O
all O
over O
the O
map O
. O

Erich B-PERS
got O
diarrhea O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
the O
Russians B-LOC
could O
be O
doing O
to O
the O
car O
, O
but O
it O
was O
high O
time O
for O
it O
seemed O
to O
calm O
his O
nerves O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
all O
of O
us O
were O
glad O
that O
we O
could O
have O
a O
shave O
, O
and O
they O
sewed O
us O
a O
lost O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
flag O
for O
free O
. O

Then O
we O
set O
about O
our O
task O
in O
the O
Volary B-LOC
hospital O
, O
wrote O
up O
a O
report O
on O
it O
for O
the O
Joint B-ORG
, O
ate O
some O
more O
or O
less O
beef O
goulash O
, O
and O
then O
headed O
out O
toward O
Vyšší B-LOC
Brod I-LOC
. O

The O
weather O
continued O
to O
be O
nice O
, O
the O
landscape O
was O
even O
nicer O
, O
our O
mood O
was O
great O
, O
our O
vocal O
cords O
were O
tired O
, O
and O
the O
road O
looked O
like O
a O
slice O
of O
Emmental O
cheese O
. O

In O
Vyšší B-LOC
Brod I-LOC
, O
we O
bought O
some O
bread O
and O
salami O
in O
advance O
of O
hungry O
times O
in O
Austria B-LOC
, O
collected O
information O
about O
border O
crossings O
, O
and O
drove O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
nearby O
state O
border O
. O

There O
, O
the O
American B-LOC
patrol O
regretfully O
informed O
us O
that O
the O
roadblock O
was O
hermetically O
sealed O
for O
everyone O
, O
even O
if O
General O
Eisenhower B-PERS
himself O
were O
to O
come O
. O

We O
were O
ordered O
by O
the O
H.Q. O
of O
the O
XXVI O
Div O
. O

to O
go O
to O
Pilsen B-LOC
to O
pick O
up O
a O
permit O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
use O
our O
fluent O
knowledge O
of O
English B-LOC
to O
change O
their O
minds O
. O

Amazed O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
civilian O
was O
finally O
speaking O
to O
him O
in O
his O
native O
language O
, O
he O
telephoned O
various O
commanders O
in O
charge O
and O
continuously O
told O
us O
he O
was O
sorry O
to O
keep O
us O
waiting O
so O
long O
. O

Every O
10 O
minutes O
, O
a O
different O
gentleman O
would O
come O
to O
apologize O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
conducted O
very O
interesting O
interviews O
, O
one O
with O
the O
American B-LOC
sergeant O
about O
attitudes O
towards O
the O
Russians B-LOC
( O
why O
are O
they O
so O
dirty O
? O
) O
and O
the O
Germans B-LOC
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
other O
with O
a O
Czech B-LOC
financier O
about O
the O
Americans B-LOC
. O

We O
received O
an O
overview O
of O
the O
international O
situation O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
customs O
office O
in O
Studánky B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
already O
full O
dark O
when O
the O
colonel O
wished O
to O
speak O
with O
us O
over O
the O
telephone O
. O

He O
explained O
to O
Erich B-PERS
that O
he O
wasn’t O
permitted O
to O
let O
us O
pass O
and O
that O
he O
was O
sorry O
. O

But O
immediately O
afterwards O
, O
the O
lieutenant O
asked O
us O
whether O
we O
wanted O
to O
cross O
the O
border O
immediately O
or O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O

We O
decided O
on O
the O
next O
morning O
and O
triumphantly O
returned O
to O
the O
Hotel O
Primator O
in O
Vyšší B-LOC
Brod I-LOC

Mutton O

gravy O

and O
an O
endless O
conversation O
with O
an O
idiot O
from O
Wisconsin B-LOC
, O
who O
worked O
as O
a O
cowboy O
. O

We O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O

were O
asleep O
by O
8:30 O

A O
right O

at O
the O
right O

at O
the O

place O
made O
the O
bitter O

sweeter O

but O
it O
wasn’t O
enough O
for O
the O

We O
headed O
out O
, O
confident O
that O
at O
least O
the O
American B-LOC
patrol O
would O
let O
us O
through O
, O
which O
is O
why O
we O
were O
in O
such O
good O
spirits O

The O
first O
hoarfrost O
covered O
the O
meadows O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
Americans B-LOC
recognized O
our O
car O
from O
a O
distance O
, O
they O
opened O
the O
gates O
without O

The O

trouble O
of O
handing O

the O

continued O
on O
our O
drive O
to O
Austria B-LOC
. O

We O
sang O
the O
songs O
Andulko O
, O
stroj O
koně O
, O
pojedeme O
do O
Rakous O
and O
O O
, O
du O
mein O
Oesterreich O
, O
fortissimo O
and O
bade O
farewell O
to O
the O
Czech B-LOC
groves O
and O
meadows O
with O
one O
last O
backward O
glance O
. O

Then O
we O
stood O
once O
again O
in O
front O
of O
a O
barrier O
: O
a O
Russian B-LOC
checkpoint O
. O

As O
before O
, O
a O
private O
read O
the O
Russian B-LOC
version O
of O
our O
papers O
with O
great O
interest O
, O
after O
which O
he O
sauntered O
off O
to O
the O
officer O
’ O
s O
hut O
. O

He O
soon O
returned O
and O
resolutely O
uttered O
: O
Obrať O
suda O
( O
go O
back O
) O
with O
the O
appropriate O
accompanying O
gesture O
. O

We O
began O
reasoning O
with O
him O
, O
firmly O
stating O
that O
we O
were O
needed O
in O
Linz B-LOC
and O
not O
obrátit O
suda O
. O

With O
less O
confidence O
this O
time O
, O
the O
private O
declared O
that O
the O
officer O
had O
ordered O
obrať O
suda O
. O

While O
we O
were O
talking O
, O
a O
sleepy O
and O
improperly O
attired O
officer O
, O
a O
young O
and O
nice O
- O
looking O
fellow O
, O
appeared O
and O
asked O
with O
a O
childlike O
smile O
when O
we O
would O
be O
returning O
from O
Linz B-LOC
, O
saying O
that O
he O
needed O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
wanted O
to O
come O
back O
on O
the O
same O
day O
. O

The O
private O
had O
probably O
only O
been O
half O
listening O
, O
heard O
the O
word O
back O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
send O
us O
back O
to O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

The O
road O
was O
in O
good O
shape O
and O
we O
drove O
for O
free O
without O
needing O
gas O
since O
it O
was O
downhill O
all O
the O
way O
. O

With O
the O
sun O
shining O
overhead O
, O
we O
descended O
into O
a O
valley O
thickly O
covered O
in O
fog O
, O
which O
we O
drove O
into O
and O
then O
it O
hung O
over O
us O
all O
day O
like O
a O
gray O
cloud O
. O

We O
were O
the O
only O
witnesses O
to O
the O
beautiful O
autumn O
sunlight O
in O
Leonsdorf O
, O
while O
the O
day O
was O
entirely O
gray O
in O
Uhrfahr B-LOC
. O

In O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
we O
arrived O
in O
Uhrfahr B-LOC
, O
a O
suburb O
of O
Linz B-LOC
in O
the O
Danube B-LOC
region O
. O

Our O
fear O
of O
the O
Russians B-LOC
seizing O
our O
car O
gradually O
abated O
as O
we O
met O
many O
Russians B-LOC
along O
the O
way O
and O
none O
paid O
any O
attention O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
well O
aware O
that O
the O
Danube B-LOC
River I-LOC
is O
the O
border O
between O
the O
Russian B-LOC
and O
American B-LOC
zones O
and O
that O
there O
were O
patrols O
on O
the O
bridge O
. O

The O
bridge O
appeared O
out O
of O
the O
fog O
, O
and O
although O
we O
saw O
some O
booths O
with O
Russian B-LOC
and O
American B-LOC
soldiers O
, O
they O
perhaps O
didn’t O
see O
us O
and O
tralala O
we O
quickly O
crossed O
the O
bridge O
. O

We O
didn’t O
get O
far O
before O
we O
heard O
a O
shout O
saying O
stop O
, O
halt O
, O
stop O
, O
and O
then O
savage O
Mongols O
rushed O
towards O
us O
. O

From O
the O
confusion O
in O
their O
voices O
we O
could O
only O
understand O
: O
confiscate O
the O
car O
. O

Erich B-PERS
paled O
, O
but O
gasped O
when O
, O
after O
our O
explanation O
that O
we O
were O
just O
ordinary O
people O
, O
the O
threat O
and O
demand O
to O
obtain O
a O
pass O
from O
the O
Russian B-LOC
command O
to O
gain O
entry O
into O
the O
American B-LOC
zone O
remained O
. O

But O
today O
is O
Sunday O
, O
nobody O
is O
working O
, O
wait O
til O
tomorrow O
. O

Until O
tomorrow O
? O
What O
does O
a O
Jew O
do O
when O
he O
’s O
at O
his O
wit O
’s O
end O
? O
He O
finds O
a O
cafe O
. O

A O
nice O
cozy O
Austrian B-LOC
cafe O
with O
female O
servers O
, O
pornographic O
drawings O
on O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
, O
best O
of O
all O
, O
a O
nice O
clean O
bathroom O
. O

It O
was O
warm O
, O
and O
the O
joyful O
discovery O
that O
our O
marks O
were O
valid O
made O
us O
happy O
. O

Erich B-PERS
started O
to O
get O
sentimental O
when O
he O
heard O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
dialect O
once O
again O
. O

Then O
we O
told O
ourselves O
, O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
that O
it O
’s O
Sunday O
, O
let O
’s O
try O
our O
luck O
at O
the O
command O
, O
but O
nobody O
was O
there O
. O

So O
we O
set O
off O
on O
a O
futile O
search O
for O
a O
place O
to O
stay O
the O
night O
. O

At O
11:00 O
, O
we O
headed O
out O
towards O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
. O

The O
road O
was O
in O
bad O
shape O
and O
we O
arrived O
around O
12:00 O
. O

We O
noticed O
three O
people O
who O
looked O
to O
be O
of O
Jewish O
origin O
on O
the O
street O
, O
struck O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
them O
, O
and O
then O
we O
all O
found O
a O
pub O
where O
Erich B-PERS
’s I-PERS
eloquence O
, O
helped O
by O
his O
Austrian B-LOC
dialect O
and O
a O
few O
American B-LOC
cigarettes O
, O
managed O
to O
win O
over O
the O
natives O
. O

We O
also O
got O
a O
lunch O
out O
of O
it O
, O
rather O
decent O
and O
not O
requiring O
rations O
tickets O
. O

However O
, O
what O
really O
tested O
our O
patience O
was O
the O
torrent O
of O
endless O
chatter O
from O
our O
Polish B-LOC
female O
guide O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
and O
we O
thought O
about O
how O
to O
extricate O
ourselves O
from O
the O
enemy O
the O
entire O
time O
. O

We O
learned O
from O
our O
guides O
that O
the O
last O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
prisoners O
were O
convalescing O
in O
the O
sanatorium O
in O
Katzdorf B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
could O
also O
find O
a O
place O
to O
sleep O
and O
some O
supper O
. O

And O
so O
to O
Katzdorf B-LOC
we O
went O
. O

There O
, O
the O
chief O
physician O
, O
Dr O
. O

Cederbaum B-PERS
, O
greeted O
us O
with O
an O
Eastern O
, O
almost O
Japanese O
, O
courtesy O
. O

He O
would O
have O
thrown O
himself O
on O
the O
floor O
for O
us O
to O
tread O
over O
him O
. O

He O
apologized O
for O
bothering O
us O
with O
his O
presence O
, O
even O
for O
being O
alive O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
were O
served O
a O
nice O
dinner O
with O
real O
Emmental O
cheese O
and O
lots O
of O
over O
- O
sweetened O
coffee O
. O

The O
Polish B-LOC
nurses O
rushed O
to O
see O
the O
interesting O
guests O
who O
had O
come O
from O
far O
and O
wide O
, O
and O
when O
we O
retired O
to O
our O
rooms O
to O
write O
our O
report O
on O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
, O
one O
after O
another O
popped O
in O
to O
see O
us O
, O
but O
their O
reasons O
for O
these O
intrusions O
were O
very O
kind O
: O
to O
light O
the O
stove O
to O
heat O
the O
room O
or O
bring O
us O
some O
more O
food O
. O

Only O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
slept O
together O
saved O
us O
from O
more O
of O
these O
reasons O
. O

We O
spent O
a O
comfortable O
and O
slightly O
boring O
night O
there O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
sinfully O
late O
, O
falling O
asleep O
after O
10:00 O
. O

As O
we O
fell O
asleep O
alone O
again O
, O
Vinči B-PERS
declared O
: O
Sonička O
isn’t O
allowed O
and O
the O
others O
aren’t O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
hot O
water O
during O
our O
morning O
ablutions O
was O
extremely O
pleasant O
. O

The O
disappointed O
nurses O
welcomed O
us O
with O
reproachful O
looks O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
made O
us O
a O
proper O
breakfast O
. O

We O
discreetly O
made O
a O
few O
breads O
disappear O
into O
our O
pockets O
, O
because O
we O
were O
worried O
about O
procuring O
food O
in O
Austria B-LOC
. O

By O
9:00 O
we O
were O
back O
at O
the O
Russian B-LOC
command O
. O

Over O
one O
hundred O
people O
wanted O
the O
same O
thing O
we O
did O
and O
were O
waiting O
patiently O
in O
line O
. O

Erich B-PERS
took O
the O
lead O
and O
with O
vigorous O
steps O
, O
decked O
in O
tricolor O
, O
we O
stepped O
into O
the O
building O
, O
overcame O
the O
weak O
resistance O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
and O
Austrian B-LOC
guards O
, O
and O
stood O
before O
the O
commander O
. O

In O
a O
matter O
of O
minutes O
, O
a O
nice O
interpreter O
filled O
out O
our O
passes O
for O
us O
and O
for O
the O
car O
and O
we O
hurried O
back O
to O
the O
American B-LOC
zone O
. O

This O
time O
, O
we O
graciously O
stopped O
by O
the O
guardhouse O
and O
with O
our O
noses O
in O
the O
air O
drove O
triumphantly O
toward O
the O
promised O
land O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
Military O
Government O
to O
get O
our O
passports O
for O
Munich B-LOC
. O

We O
parked O
in O
a O
spot O
for O
government O
vehicles O
only O
and O
once O
again O
walked O
brazenly O
past O
the O
crowd O
of O
people O
waiting O
to O
the O
back O
doors O
deliberately O
to O
a O
wrong O
room O
, O
correctly O
assuming O
that O
they O
would O
want O
to O
dump O
us O
in O
the O
right O
room O
. O

Pretty O
Linzer B-LOC
girls O
led O
us O
there O
through O
the O
back O
. O

We O
peered O
into O
the O
criminal O
proceedings O
on O
the O
Linz B-LOC
black O
market O
in O
money O
trading O
, O
finagled O
an O
American B-LOC
stamp O
on O
my O
pass O
, O
and O
found O
out O
that O
passports O
for O
Germany B-LOC
can O
only O
be O
issued O
by O
the O
C.I.C. B-ORG
We O
procured O
ration O
cards O
for O
2 O
days O
and O
drove O
to O
the O
C.I.C. B-ORG
full O
of O
hope O
. O

There O
, O
however O
, O
we O
hit O
a O
brick O
wall O
. O

Exit O
permits O
were O
only O
issued O
by O
the O
G O

in O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

Mr O
. O

Higgins B-PERS
was O
very O
well O
- O
mannered O
, O
but O
cold O
and O
unapproachable O
. O

I O
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
could O
have O
gotten O
the O
permits O
there O
, O
but O
our O
negotiations O
became O
deadlocked O
. O

Full O
of O
woeful O
self O
- O
recriminations O
, O
we O
drove O
through O
a O
beautiful O
residential O
neighborhood O
back O
to O
the O
vibrant O
city O
, O
first O
to O
the O
D.P. O
Center O
and O
then O
for O
lunch O
at O
a O
restaurant O
( O
beef O
goulash O
, O
beans O
, O
and O
potatoes O
) O
, O
whose O
owner O
was O
a O
clairvoyant O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
with O
better O
weather O
and O
an O
improved O
mood O
, O
we O
drove O
to O
Ebensee B-CAMP
. O

The O
approaching O
Alp B-LOC
Mountains O
made O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
us O
. O

We O
were O
in O
such O
a O
good O
mood O
that O
we O
gave O
a O
ride O
to O
two O
country O
girls O
smelling O
of O
stables O
, O
earth O
, O
and O
potatoes O
. O

We O
liked O
Gmunden B-LOC
so O
well O
that O
we O
stopped O
there O
for O
an O
hour O
. O

Erich B-PERS
searched O
in O
vain O
for O
a O
pissoir O
because O
civilians O
weren’t O
allowed O
in O
hotels O
or O
restaurants O
in O
Gmunden B-LOC
. O

In O
return O
, O
we O
admired O
the O
lake O
and O
the O
swans O
, O
but O
Erich B-PERS
claimed O
that O
this O
wasn’t O
an O
adequate O
substitute O
. O

So O
we O
jumped O
into O
the O
car O
again O
and O
soon O
arrived O
in O
Ebensee B-CAMP
. O

Once O
more O
, O
we O
picked O
up O
two O
Jewish O
girls O
on O
the O
way O
, O
so O
well O
- O
fed O
that O
we O
drove O
in O
second O
gear O
. O

The O
holes O
in O
the O
road O
were O
incredibly O
deep O
. O

The O
girls O
led O
us O
to O
the O
boys O
from O
the O
Jewish O
committee O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
them O
about O
how O
they O
were O
faring O
, O
they O
began O
to O
tell O
us O
with O
pity O
on O
their O
faces O
( O
rachmones O
ponem O
) O
that O
the O
Joint B-ORG
and O
the O
UNRRA B-ORG
are O
abandoning O
the O
poor O
Jews O
to O
live O
in O
hunger O
and O
misery O
. O

These O
deeply O
sorrowful O
narrators O
had O
well O
- O
fed O
faces O
and O
we O
wouldn’t O
have O
been O
so O
moved O
had O
we O
not O
been O
deprived O
of O
a O
good O
dinner O
. O

Their O
demeanor O
immediately O
changed O
when O
we O
timidly O
asked O
where O
we O
could O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
at O
their O
place O
, O
because O
, O
God O
be O
praised O
, O
they’re O
not O
dependent O
on O
the O
Joint B-ORG
, O
they O
, O
God O
be O
praised O
, O
are O
clever O
enough O
, O
God O
be O
praised O
, O
they O
can O
provide O
enough O
for O
themselves O
and O
others O
and O
so O
they’re O
not O
starving O
. O

White O
bread O
was O
sliced O
, O
American B-LOC
lard O
was O
spread O
on O
it O
, O
an O
American B-LOC
can O
of O
ham O
was O
opened O
; O
Vinči B-PERS
couldn’t O
stand O
it O
any O
longer O
and O
smoked O
their O
American B-LOC
cigarette O
. O

It O
wasn’t O
easy O
to O
find O
a O
place O
to O
sleep O
and O
so O
we O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
where O
they O
finally O
put O
us O
up O
in O
the O
Kreisszimmeru O
( O
we O
don’t O
know O
how O
to O
say O
this O
in O
Czech B-LOC
) O
birthing O
suite O
. O

We O
met O
the O
head O
physician O
, O
Dr O
. O

Wortmann B-PERS
, O
who O
made O
a O
very O
good O
impression O
on O
us O
, O
along O
with O
the O
dentist O
Dr O
. O

Feur B-PERS
and O
his O
rather O
pretty O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
Malá B-PERS
. O

They O
were O
walking O
on O
eggshells O
as O
they O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
cinema O
in O
Ischl B-LOC
. O

13 O
km O
away O
? O
The O
film O
starts O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
? O
Will O
there O
still O
be O
tickets O
available O
? O
So O
we O
said O
we’d O
go O
with O
them O
. O

After O
that O
, O
everything O
happened O
too O
fast O
. O

We O
quickly O
filled O
the O
car O
with O
petrol O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
washed O
our O
hands O
, O
didn’t O
have O
time O
to O
change O
. O

In O
our O
haste O
, O
we O
couldn’t O
turn O
the O
car O
around O
because O
of O
all O
the O
obstacles O
, O
like O
trees O
, O
stones O
, O
tracks O
, O
etc O
. O

We O
somehow O
made O
it O
out O
, O
but O
drove O
to O
Ischl B-LOC
way O
too O
fast O
. O

And O
then O
it O
happened O
. O

A O
large O
American B-LOC
truck O
was O
coming O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
, O
didn’t O
dim O
its O
lights O
, O
and O
crash O
! O
Shards O
rained O
down O
on O
Erich B-PERS
with O
a O
clatter O
, O
the O
side O
window O
was O
shattered O
. O

We O
somehow O
managed O
to O
stop O
and O
the O
sight O
that O
greeted O
us O
was O
terrible O
. O

The O
left O
fender O
was O
a O
shapeless O
mass O
, O
Erich B-PERS
’s I-PERS
hand O
was O
bleeding O
profusely O
, O
the O
door O
handle O
was O
damaged O
, O
and O
the O
flag O
was O
gone O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
we O
were O
fine O
and O
so O
we O
straightened O
the O
thing O
that O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fender O
and O
were O
amazed O
at O
the O
results O
. O

We O
hurried O
on O
towards O
Ischl B-LOC
, O
got O
our O
tickets O
, O
and O
were O
there O
with O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
spare O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
lock O
the O
car O
, O
so O
Erich B-PERS
drove O
to O
some O
gate O
next O
to O
the O
cinema O
after O
giving O
the O
concierge O
a O
large O
bribe O
. O

From O
a O
fancy O
side O
box O
, O
we O
watched O
a O
rather O
bad O
movie O
in O
color O
, O
Münchhausen O
. O

Barely O
thirty O
minutes O
in O
, O
the O
film O
was O
interrupted O
and O
a O
man O
’s O
voice O
said O
: O
Der O
Besitzer O
des O
Auto O
mit O
CS O
- O
Nummer O
soll O
sofort O
vor O
das O
Kino O
kommen O
. O

A O
chill O
ran O
through O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Soon O
, O
however O
, O
Erich B-PERS
returned O
. O

Nothing O
serious O
had O
happened O
, O
just O
someone O
trying O
to O
enter O
his O
garage O
and O
our O
car O
was O
blocking O
the O
way O
. O

After O
the O
movie O
, O
we O
happily O
drove O
home O
, O
though O
our O
outlook O
was O
gray O
. O

Neither O
the O
glass O
nor O
the O
handle O
could O
be O
replaced O
and O
the O
car O
wouldn’t O
close O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
find O
the O
bridge O
across O
the O
Traun B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

Our O
attempt O
to O
turn O
around O
on O
a O
narrow O
street O
ended O
in O
a O
wet O
meadow O
with O
our O
wheels O
spinning O
, O
but O
this O
was O
the O
last O
adventure O
of O
this O
eventful O
day O
. O

Viribus O
unitis O
, O
we O
pushed O
the O
car O
onto O
the O
road O
, O
finally O
found O
the O
bridge O
, O
made O
it O
home O
, O
ate O
a O
dinner O
of O
tuna O
and O
a O
mysterious O
lukewarm O
liquid O
( O
apparently O
coffee O
) O
, O
and O
went O
to O
sleep O
. O

Twice O
a O
nurse O
stopped O
by O
during O
the O
night O
to O
see O
whether O
we O
were O
kreissujeme O
giving O
birth O
, O
Erich B-PERS
talked O
a O
lot O
in O
his O
sleep O
, O
but O
we O
were O
alive O
and O
well O
. O

Erich B-PERS
slept O
poorly O
because O
he O
kept O
dreaming O
of O
wanting O
to O
give O
birth O
, O
but O
the O
genius O
wasn’t O
so O
strong O
. O

At O
the O
Poles B-LOC
, O
we O
met O
Dr O
. O

Bester B-PERS
, O
a O
good O
- O
natured O
man O
who O
heads O
their O
committee O
with O
great O
difficulty O
and O
makes O
an O
excellent O
impression O
on O
people O
. O

It O
wore O
off O
when O
the O
breakfast O
delicacies O
were O
served O
: O
nes O
- O
coffee O
with O
powdered O
milk O
, O
sandwiches O
with O
lard O
, O
cheese O
, O
and O
jam O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
painful O
moment O
when O
, O
due O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
split O
up O
: O
Erich B-PERS
was O
tasked O
with O
repairing O
the O
car O
while O
this O
was O
still O
possible O
and O
liaising O
with O
UNRRY B-ORG
, O
while O
Vinči B-PERS
, O
accompanied O
by O
the O
Pole B-LOC
Bodenstein B-PERS
, O
explored O
the O
concentration O
camp O
with O
a O
Leica O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
however O
not O
without O
obstacles O
. O

The O
Americans B-LOC
only O
let O
people O
into O
the O
camp O
with O
a O
special O
permission O
from O
H.Q. O
, O
but O
it O
wasn’t O
worth O
going O
there O
and O
getting O
one O
because O
there O
wasn’t O
anything O
to O
see O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
went O
to O
see O
various O
tunnels O
; O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
working O
conditions O
must O
have O
been O
unbearable O
. O

As O
we O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
camp O
, O
we O
were O
suddenly O
stopped O
by O
an O
American B-LOC
soldier O
in O
the O
guard O
tower O
, O
telling O
us O
that O
civilians O
weren’t O
supposed O
to O
be O
here O
. O

He O
probably O
had O
time O
to O
waste O
and O
wanted O
to O
have O
some O
fun O
, O
so O
he O
called O
his O
lieutenant O
, O
who O
let O
us O
go O
after O
a O
brief O
explanation O
. O

The O
soldier O
was O
probably O
disappointed O
if O
he O
hoped O
that O
we O
would O
have O
at O
least O
been O
locked O
up O
in O
the O
concentration O
camp O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Erich B-PERS
tapped O
into O
his O
vast O
resources O
of O
insolence O
and O
attacked O
Mr O
. O

Fenenga B-PERS
, O
head O
of O
the O
local O
UNRRY B-ORG
, O
and O
immediately O
snagged O
a O
whole O
can O
of O
petrol O
. O

He O
also O
got O
the O
D.P. O
Committee O
to O
hand O
over O
logs O
, O
records O
, O
and O
a O
promise O
to O
reproduce O
16 O
extremely O
valuable O
photographs O
. O

He O
made O
contact O
with O
a O
Czech B-LOC
woman I-LOC
married O
to O
a O
Yugoslav O
, O
who O
promised O
to O
procure O
and O
even O
pay O
for O
the O
photographs O
. O

The O
fender O
was O
hammered O
into O
shape O
and O
welded O
and O
once O
again O
somewhat O
resembled O
a O
fender O
. O

He O
then O
sent O
a O
telegram O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
so O
that O
we O
would O
have O
an O
address O
to O
send O
the O
photographs O
to O
. O

We O
had O
wanted O
to O
buy O
some O
salt O
, O
but O
, O
of O
course O
, O
we O
forgot O
. O

Our O
businessmen O
offered O
us O
watches O
, O
cognac O
, O
chocolate O
, O
petrol O
, O
cigarettes O
, O
but O
we O
didn’t O
buy O
anything O
. O

When O
we O
finally O
got O
home O
, O
the O
nice O
Polish B-LOC
girls O
snuggled O
up O
to O
us O
. O

Just O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
they O
wanted O
a O
ride O
, O
raved O
about O
Prague B-LOC
, O
especially O
Prague B-LOC
’ O
s O
cafes O
and O
shops O
, O
and O
dashed O
off O
letters O
for O
us O
to O
take O
home O
with O
us O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
lunch O
, O
which O
was O
worth O
it O
, O
and O
then O
said O
goodbye O
and O
took O
one O
passenger O
with O
us O
to O
Ischl B-LOC
. O

On O
our O
way O
there O
, O
we O
of O
course O
didn’t O
find O
the O
lost O
handle O
, O
but O
in O
Ischl B-LOC
Mr O
. O

Stadler B-PERS
searched O
for O
a O
long O
while O
, O
so O
we O
waved O
some O
tobacco O
at O
him O
and O
he O
softened O
, O
going O
straight O
to O
work O
on O
the O
glass O
. O

Erich B-PERS
was O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
found O
such O
a O
fool O
, O
because O
glass O
is O
the O
hardest O
thing O
to O
source O
for O
cars O
. O

He O
had O
to O
do O
the O
disassembly O
and O
assembly O
practically O
by O
himself O
, O
but O
the O
foreman O
broke O
the O
glass O
while O
installing O
it O
. O

So O
it O
was O
cracked O
, O
but O
usable O
. O

The O
handles O
were O
also O
fixed O
, O
except O
for O
the O
irreplaceable O
one O
with O
the O
lock O
, O
so O
we O
recovered O
from O
the O
accident O
without O
a O
black O
eye O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Vinči B-PERS
had O
stopped O
by O
the O
local O
D.P. O
Committee O
, O
where O
he O
chanced O
upon O
Heinz B-PERS
Bleicher I-PERS
, O
an O
old O
Terezín B-GHETTO
prisoner I-GHETTO
, O
who O
runs O
the O
Ischl B-LOC
Padowetz O
, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
the O
Goldenes O
Kreuz O
. O

This O
eliminated O
our O
worries O
about O
where O
we O
would O
spend O
the O
night O
and O
eat O
dinner O
, O
and O
to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
we O
also O
got O
some O
movie O
tickets O
. O

So O
we O
had O
a O
good O
meal O
of O
Leberkäse O
and O
walked O
down O
Esplanade O
and O
past O
the O
Stehbeisl O
to O
the O
cinema O
. O

Our O
mood O
was O
almost O
too O
good O
and O
we O
conversed O
only O
in O
Czech B-LOC
, O
which O
gave O
us O
a O
certain O
confidence O
, O
thinking O
for O
sure O
nobody O
in O
Ischl B-LOC
understands O
Czech B-LOC
, O
and O
therefore O
our O
speech O
wasn’t O
the O
most O
polished O
. O

We O
saw O
a O
great O
Anglo B-LOC
- O
American B-LOC
weekly O
with O
German B-LOC
spoken O
accompaniment O
and O
a O
German B-LOC
film O
that O
Vinči B-PERS
called O
uber O
kitsch O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
film O
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
when O
it O
was O
over O
we O
continued O
in O
our O
manly O
coarse O
entertainment O
. O

We O
heartily O
and O
loudly O
laughed O
at O
our O
crude O
jokes O
until O
suddenly O
a O
woman O
’s O
voice O
addressed O
us O
in O
Czech B-LOC
— O
a O
lady O
from O
Brno B-LOC
who O
was O
happy O
to O
hear O
Czech B-LOC
sounds O
. O

You O
should O
have O
seen O
Vinči B-PERS
’s I-PERS
face O
. O

She O
wanted O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
us O
presently O
, O
but O
she O
didn’t O
appeal O
to O
us O
and O
so O
we O
discreetly O
sauntered O
away O
from O
her O
and O
laughed O
about O
it O
for O
hours O
. O

Esplanade O
by O
night O
and O
especially O
the O
Traun B-LOC
River O
was O
what O
we O
really O
needed O
. O

We O
dined O
again O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
wrote O
a O
report O
on O
Ebensee B-CAMP
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
were O
gratified O
to O
find O
three O
pointed O
glasses O
from O
a O
medical O
laboratory O
in O
our O
room O
. O

Austria B-LOC
is O
a O
country O
blessed O
with O
a O
beautiful O
countryside O
. O

We’ll O
never O
forget O
the O
ride O
through O
its O
colorful O
landscape O
and O
the O
salt O
chambers O
. O

The O
vivid O
autumn O
colors O
were O
intensified O
by O
the O
snow O
that O
fell O
at O
night O
, O
covering O
the O
surrounding O
hills O
, O
the O
clear O
blue O
sky O
and O
all O
of O
the O
shades O
from O
yellow O
to O
red O
and O
brown O
of O
the O
dying O
leaves O
. O

In O
short O
, O
we O
had O
to O
forbid O
one O
another O
from O
looking O
at O
such O
beauty O
because O
we O
didn’t O
deserve O
it O
. O

The O
day O
was O
like O
a O
beautiful O
summer O
day O
in O
August O
, O
warm O
with O
not O
a O
cloud O
in O
sight O
. O

We O
drove O
past O
Bad B-LOC
Ischl I-LOC
, O
used O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
ration O
tickets O
to O
buy O
ham O
salami O
, O
butter O
, O
buns O
, O
took O
one O
last O
look O
at O
the O
Esplanade O
and O
off O
we O
went O
to O
Salzburg B-LOC
. O

In O
reality O
, O
the O
scarcity O
in O
Austria B-LOC
isn’t O
that O
bad O
. O

Everything O
is O
available O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
have O
ration O
tickets O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
saw O
things O
in O
shop O
windows O
that O
we O
don’t O
have O
back O
home O
, O
like O
toothbrushes O
, O
shaving O
brushes O
, O
wool O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
food O
, O
the O
hardest O
item O
to O
find O
is O
sugar O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
where O
you O
won’t O
find O
any O
at O
all O
. O

After O
we O
left O
Ischl B-LOC
, O
checkpoints O
didn’t O
disturb O
us O
much O
any O
longer O
. O

We O
drove O
around O
the O
beautiful O
Wolfgangsee B-LOC
, O
saw O
the O
smooth O
surface O
of O
the O
St B-LOC
. I-LOC

Wolfgang I-LOC
lake O
with O
the O
Schafberg B-LOC
, O
and O
were O
forced O
to O
stop O
several O
times O
to O
gaze O
in O
silence O
at O
this O
marvelous O
beauty O
. O

We O
kept O
on O
going O
along O
the O
beautiful O
Fuscher B-LOC
See I-LOC
road O
and O
took O
the O
descending O
turns O
from O
Gaisberg B-LOC
to O
Salzburg B-LOC
. O

This O
city O
is O
a O
chapter O
unto O
itself O
. O

Despite O
being O
badly O
damaged O
, O
it O
has O
retained O
the O
charm O
for O
which O
Americans B-LOC
call O
it O
the O
most O
beautiful O
city O
in O
the O
world O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
lively O
city O
because O
the O
HQ O
of O
USFA O
is O
located O
there O
. O

It O
’s O
crawling O
with O
soldiers O
and O
privates O
, O
UNRRA B-ORG
, O
and O
others O
. O

We O
went O
directly O
to O
the O
MG O
. O

After O
our O
experience O
with O
our O
trip O
to O
Bavaria B-LOC
, O
we O
felt O
little O
hope O
of O
success O
. O

We O
first O
looked O
for O
the O
Joint B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
reached O
by O
a O
well O
- O
marked O
but O
winding O
road O
. O

Chaverim O
in O
Ebensee B-CAMP
were O
right O
when O
they O
predicted O
that O
neither O
Colonel O
Reznik B-PERS
( O
the O
head O
) O
nor O
his O
deputy O
would O
be O
in O
. O

They O
were O
both O
away O
on O
business O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
us O
. O

The O
little O
Polish B-LOC
Jew O
Feuermann B-PERS
bent O
over O
backward O
with O
politeness O
and O
willingness O
once O
he O
saw O
our O
papers O
, O
and O
led O
us O
to O
the O
dreaded O
Cpt O
. O

Nowinsky B-PERS
, O
a O
clerk O
for O
the O
D.P. O
A O
number O
of O
people O
were O
waiting O
there O
for O
travel O
permits O
as O
well O
. O

He O
introduced O
us O
and O
the O
cpt O
. O

barely O
only O
glanced O
at O
our O
papers O
before O
he O
pressed O
two O
papers O
into O
our O
hands O
to O
fill O
in O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
would O
then O
stamp O
them O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
believe O
it O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
the O
process O
wasn’t O
all O
that O
smooth O
. O

These O
were O
papers O
for O
the O
Deutsche B-LOC
Heimkehrer O
. O

So O
we O
decided O
to O
be O
Deutsche B-LOC
Heimkehrer O
nach O
München B-LOC
. O

We O
filled O
them O
out O
, O
they O
were O
immediately O
signed O
and O
stamped O
, O
and O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
. O

Again O
, O
we O
saw O
many O
dangers O
and O
risks O
that O
Vinči B-PERS
could O
categorize O
alphabetically O
, O
but O
there O
wouldn’t O
be O
enough O
letters O
. O

Czechoslovak B-LOC
citizens O
with O
passports O
and O
only O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
car O
papers O
could O
return O
to O
Munich B-LOC
as O
repatriates O
. O

We O
put O
our O
hands O
in O
fate O
and O
threw O
ourselves O
into O
it O
. O

We O
stopped O
by O
at O
the O
D.P. O
Committee O
, O
where O
a O
lively O
Austrian B-LOC
partisan O
attended O
to O
us O
, O
took O
us O
to O
the O
US B-LOC
. O

O.S.S. B-ORG
, O
and O
we O
were O
promised O
photographic O
reproductions O
. O

He O
then O
took O
us O
to O
the O
Salzburg B-LOC
Padovec O
( O
Hotel O
Europe O
) O
, O
where O
we O
enjoyed O
an O
excellent O
lunch O
and O
a O
cold O
takeaway O
dinner O
( O
white O
bread O
, O
real O
Emmentaler O
, O
butter O
) O
. O

But O
even O
better O
were O
the O
Salzburg B-LOC
D.P. O
girls O
. O

It O
was O
downright O
outrageous O
how O
many O
beautiful O
girls O
they O
had O
there O
and O
Erich B-PERS
had O
his O
work O
cut O
out O
for O
him O
to O
drag O
Vinči B-PERS
out O
of O
there O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
shop O
in O
the O
bookstores O
for O
magazines O
and O
brochures O
, O
but O
they O
were O
already O
closed O
. O

So O
we O
waited O
another O
hour O
at O
the O
barber O
’s O
to O
get O
shaved O
. O

Danes O
were O
working O
there O
, O
which O
was O
nice O
. O

We O
were O
sad O
to O
leave O
Salzburg B-LOC
so O
soon O
, O
but O
we O
were O
nervous O
about O
crossing O
the O
border O
on O
time O
and O
so O
we O
left O
before O
4:00 O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
on O
the O
highway O
to O
Munich B-LOC
, O
and O
through O
the O
snow O
- O
covered O
mountains O
we O
reached O
the O
border O
. O

There O
, O
we O
were O
only O
stopped O
by O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
civilian O
who O
asked O
for O
money O
and O
car O
papers O
. O

Nothing O
surprised O
him O
and O
moments O
later O
we O
were O
in O
Bavaria B-LOC
. O

We O
hadn’t O
imagined O
that O
it O
would O
be O
that O
simple O
. O

We O
feared O
the O
next O
American B-LOC
checkpoint O
. O

We O
drove O
full O
speed O
ahead O
down O
the O
autobahn O
. O

Two O
blown O
up O
bridges O
forced O
us O
to O
make O
stupid O
detours O
and O
so O
we O
pulled O
into O
Miesbach B-LOC
at O
dusk O
. O

There O
, O
the O
first O
American B-LOC
patrol O
stopped O
us O
. O

It O
looked O
bad O
. O

Not O
only O
were O
our O
papers O
not O
enough O
, O
but O
he O
wanted O
to O
know O
where O
we O
had O
stolen O
the O
GI O
- O
can O
attached O
to O
our O
car O
. O

We O
pulled O
out O
a O
briefcase O
and O
flooded O
him O
with O
documents O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
he O
could O
do O
against O
this O
onslaught O
, O
and O
so O
he O
gave O
up O
and O
we O
drove O
on O
. O

The O
next O
roadblock O
hardly O
noticed O
our O
papers O
at O
all O
. O

We O
gave O
a O
lift O
to O
a O
young O
boy O
and O
arrived O
in O
Bad B-LOC
Tölz I-LOC
at O
6:30 O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
to O
Mr O
. O

Ošeris B-PERS
Ješuneris I-PERS
, O
Erich B-PERS
’s I-PERS
chevra O
from O
the O
concentration O
camp O
. O

It O
was O
a O
touching O
reunion O
. O

Mr O
. O

Ješuner B-PERS
is O
Lithuanian B-LOC
and O
his O
almost O
- O
wife O
is O
a O
German B-LOC
Jew O
with O
all O
the O
characteristics O
of O
Mrs O
. O

von O
Pollak O
v. O
Parnegg O
. O

Erich B-PERS
even O
claims O
that O
Frau O
von O
Pollak O
can O
hide O
. O

But O
we O
must O
unreservedly O
praise O
the O
dinner O
we O
were O
treated O
to O
. O

We O
found O
out O
that O
Ošer B-PERS
remembers O
Vinči B-PERS
’s I-PERS
father O
from O
Kaunas B-GHETTO
, O
and O
, O
after O
dinner O
, O
we O
went O
with O
the O
lady O
of O
the O
house O
to O
a O
nearby O
pub O
where O
there O
’s O
dancing O
three O
times O
a O
week O
. O

With O
our O
bad O
luck O
, O
we O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
Tölz B-LOC
on O
one O
such O
day O
. O

It O
wasn’t O
actually O
that O
bad O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
interesting O
to O
see O
American B-LOC
soldiers O
, O
Jewish O
concentration O
camp O
prisoners O
, O
and O
the O
local O
German B-LOC
population O
sitting O
and O
dancing O
together O
in O
a O
crowded O
pub O
in O
defeated O
Germany B-LOC
. O

We O
didn’t O
dance O
but O
instead O
observed O
the O
people O
. O

Out O
of O
all O
the O
girls O
only O
two O
or O
three O
were O
pretty O
and O
even O
less O
were O
well O
- O
dressed O
. O

We O
didn’t O
stay O
until O
the O
end O
, O
but O
left O
to O
go O
on O
a O
short O
walk O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Tölz B-LOC
, O
breathing O
the O
fresh O
air O
of O
the O
Bavarian B-LOC
mountains O
. O

We O
then O
went O
home O
to O
our O
really O
nice O
hotel O
room O
with O
comfortable O
beds O
, O
snow O
- O
white O
sheets O
, O
and O
running O
water O
. O

We O
stayed O
up O
and O
wrote O
for O
another O
hour O
and O
then O
laid O
down O
for O
a O
well O
- O
deserved O
rest O
, O
having O
learned O
that O
breakfast O
at O
the O
Ješuneris B-PERS
is O
served O
at O
8:30 O
in O
the O
morning O

concerning O

Martha O
Hagen O

I O
understand O
, O
that O
in O
Danish B-LOC
circles O
, O
where O
the O
German B-LOC
attitude O
to O
the O
Jewish O
question O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
, O
we O
can O
be O
somewhat O
disappointed O
with O
the O
weak O
results O
in O
these O
cases O
and O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
we O
are O
too O
reluctant O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
envoy O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
like O
to O
try O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
to O
redress O
our O
difficulties O
. O

The O
official O
German O
attitude O
towards O
the O
Jews O
gradually O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
severe O
as O
the O
war O
progresses O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
seen O
as O
the O
enemies O
of O
the O
People O
and O
they O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
, O
at O
best O
through O
isolation O
in O
ghettos O
in O
the O
designated O
areas O
. O

This O
attitude O
applies O
to O
the O
Jews O
as O
a O
race O
without O
regard O
to O
citizenship O
, O
and O
the O
goal O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
Jewish O
law O
similar O
to O
the O
German O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
also O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
foreign O
Jews O
in O
Germany O
are O
spared O
some O
of O
the O
most O
rigorous O
provisions O
, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
non O
- O
German O
Jews O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
must O
be O
anti O
- O
nationalsocialist O
. O

Both O
German O
and O
foreign O
Jews O
were O
generally O
allowed O
to O
travel O
earlier O
- O
so O
they O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
- O
, O
but O
as O
the O
war O
progressed O
, O
another O
consideration O
became O
more O
and O
more O
applicable O
: O
The O
fear O
of O
information O
about O
conditions O
in O
this O
country O
being O
spread O
across O
the O
world O
, O
which O
could O
damage O
Germany O
's O
position O
and O
bring O
substance O
to O
the O
anti- O
nationalsocialist O
propaganda O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
preferable O
not O
to O
see O
too O
much O
traffic O
across O
the O
borders O
, O
by O
persons O
who O
are O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
reliable O
politically O
– O
apart O
from O
the O
difficulties O
of O
permits O
for O
entry O
and O
exit O
in O
general O
- O
and O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
who O
are O
all O
considered O
100%-unreliable O
, O
we O
now O
see O
an O
almost O
completely O
shut O
down O
. O

While O
there O
are O
still O
exceptions O
made O
for O
foreign O
Jews O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
for O
German O
Jews O
to O
travel O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
acquired O
foreign O
citizenship O
by O
marriage O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
marriage O
took O
place O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
Jewish O
law O
, O
which O
is O
the O
case O
both O
with O
the O
married O
couple O
Hagen O
and O
with O
marriage O
of O
Thomsen O
in O
Schøn O
’s O
letter O
of O
7 B-DATE
August I-DATE
to O
Ryder O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
Jewish O
laws O
, O
several O
female O
German O
Jews O
married O
foreigners O
. O

The O
German O
authorities O
regard O
all O
these O
marriages O
as O
concluded O
solely O
for O
trying O
to O
circumvent O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
motives O
behind O
the O
marriages O
are O
self O
- O
evident O
( O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
man O
from O
acting O
on O
the O
noblest O
and O
most O
humane O
motives O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
according O
to O
German O
opinion O
, O
mixing O
Aryan O
and O
Jewish O
blood O
is O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
that O
marriages O
between O
Aryans O
and O
Jews O
are O
forbidden O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
believe O
that O
we O
are O
wise O
to O
leave O
these O
cases O
as O
hopeless O
and O
save O
the O
very O
poor O
‘ O
goodwill O
’ O
we O
have O
for O
cases O
about O
Danish B-LOC
Jews O
with O
Connection O
to O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

Even O
for O
their O
part O
, O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
, O
since O
the O
German O
side O
expects O
that O
the O
government O
of O
a O
neighbouring O
country O
shows O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
German O
attitude O

to O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
regarding O
Articles O
in O
the O
' O
Kamptegnet O
' O
, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
illustrative O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
you O
suggest O
allowing O
the O
Consulate O
General O
to O
go O
to O
the O
police O
has O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
great O
caution O
. O

In O
several O
cases O
, O
the O
police O
have O
rejected O
such O
requests O
from O
the O
Consulate O
General O
and O
wanted O
the O
issue O
to O
go O
the O
diplomatic O
way O
. O

We O
have O
also O
seen O
that O
the O
police O
authorities O
have O
said O
to O
the O
Consulate O
General O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
look O
after O
the O
person O
if O
she O
continued O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
applications O
. O

We O
hereby O
reach O
a O
point O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
hasn’t O
had O
much O
attention O
at O
home O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
persons O
seeking O
our O
and O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
` I-ORG
assistance O
have O
tried O
all O
possible O
ways O
. O

The O
result O
easily O
becomes O
an O
Irritation O
to O
the O
Authorities O
, O
which O
may O
cause O
fatal O
consequences O
for O
the O
persons O
concerned O
. O

There O
is O
a O
risk O
that O
the O
authorities O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
more O
nonsense O
, O
will O
send O
those O
concerned O
to O
the O
General O
Government O
or O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
1 O
) O
that O
the O
relatively O
gentle O
treatment O
of O
foreign O
Jews O
in O
part O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
sharper O
course O
and O
2 O
) O
that O
the O
question O
of O
precautionary O
measures O
against O
Jews O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
relevant O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
of O
no O
use O
that O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
more O
famous O
than O
most O
necessary O
as O
a O
Jewish O
sanctuary O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
allow O
you O
to O
recommend O
that O
you O
explain O
to O
Mr O
. O

Hagen O
, O
that O
by O
pushing O
more O
on O

for O
the O

as O
well O

at O
10 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
was O
rather O
more O
unpleasant O
, O
as O
the O
Latvian B-LOC
SS O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
and O
and O
led O
us O
into O
the O
ghetto O
at O
a O
rapid O
pace O
, O
which O
was O
where O
the O
lash O
was O
used O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
especially O
unfortunately O
targeting O
some O
elderly O
and O
sickly O
people O
. O

We O
experienced O
the O
first O
hand O
luggage O
losses O
. O

The O
ghetto O
was O
already O
run O
by O
people O
from O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
made O
up O
the O
first O
transport O
to O
Minsk B-CAMP
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
were O
also O
people O
from O
Frankfurt B-LOC
and O
the O
Rhineland B-LOC
, O
and O
later O
more O
people O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
Berlin B-LOC
would O
arrive O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
transport O
from O
Bremen B-LOC
and O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

After O
spending O
our O
first O
nights O
in O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
Rhineland B-LOC
district O
, O
we O
were O
assigned O
our O
own O
district O
. O

Almost O
all O
the O
buildings O
there O
were O
wooden O
, O
which O
we O
had O
to O
repair O
as O
only O
after O
a O
week O
before O
our O
arrival O
, O
a O
terrible O
pogrom O
against O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Jews O
has O
taken O
place O
there O
. O

Here O
we O
were O
presented O
with O
the O
first O
horror O
show O
of O
German B-LOC
culture O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
destroyed O
furnishings O
, O
almost O
every O
house O
contained O
the O
bodies O
of O
people O
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
and O
shot O
dead O
, O
which O
had O
then O
been O
fed O
on O
by O
dogs O
, O
cats O
and O
rats O
. O

In O
the O
individual O
rooms O
, O
depending O
on O
size O
there O
were O
6 O
- O
8 O
or O
even O
10 O
to O
a O
room O
; O
this O
action O
was O
carried O
out O
to O
almost O
general O
satisfaction O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
for O
many O
people O
, O
there O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
surprise O
in O
that O
their O
luggage O
did O
not O
arrive O
so O
they O
only O
owned O
whatever O
they O
had O
on O
their O
bodies O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
was O
the O
situation O
in O
which O
I O
found O
myself O
. O

But O
there O
were O
some O
courageous O
people O
who O
at O
least O
helped O
with O
laundry O
. O

Immediately O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
December B-DATE
there O
were O
jobs O
for O
craftsmen O
. O

Since O
we O
only O
received O
200 O
gr O
. O

bread O
and O
a O
fatless O
soup O
each O
day O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
there O
was O
great O
demand O
for O
work O
and O
some O
people O
managed O
to O
get O
good O
jobs O
, O
which O
were O
characterized O
by O
good O
food O
. O

Also O
, O
those O
people O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
exchange O
possessions O
for O
food O
. O

After O
2 O
weeks O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
were O
already O
some O
deaths O
, O
mostly O
old O
and O
sick O
people O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
more O
and O
more O

I O
arrived O

with O
a O

circa O
350 O

12 O

had O
an O
injury O
on O

which O
caused O

Afterwards O
I O
came O
to O
the O

company O
in O
Mielec B-CAMP

In O

But O
here O
we O
did O
not O
stay O
there O
long O
and O
drove O
on O
to O
Flossenbürg B-CAMP

From O
there O
I O
only O
had O
a O

Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
characteristic O
of O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
where O
nationality O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
language O
rather O
than O
of O
blood O
, O
that O
speech O
rather O
than O
origin O
is O
the O
distinguishing O
characteristic O
of O
friend O
or O

Such O
resentment O
of O
the O
Jews O
as O
exists O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
thus O
centers O
largely O
on O
the O
German O
- O
speaking O
Jews O
– O
particularly O
those O
who O
have O
come O
to O
Bohemia B-LOC
since O
the O
war O
. O

Among O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
themselves O
, O
there O
is O
comparatively O
little O
anti O

semitism O

Only O
the O
small O
Czech B-LOC
fascist O
groups O
and O
certain O
sections O
of O
the O
nationalist O
- O
conservative O
element O
are O
anti O

This O
applies O
particularly O
to O
the O
younger O
element O
in O
the O
New B-ORG
National I-ORG
Unity I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
being O
organized O
as O
a O
government O

All O
these O
elements O
together O
, O
however O
, O
make O
up O
only O
a O
small O
minority O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
population O
. O

The O
mass O
of O
the O
people O
appear O
simply O
to O
have O
very O
little O
interest O
in O
anti O

The O
present O
talk O
of O
anti O
- O
semitic O
measures O
and O
the O
general O
anxiety O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
is O
due O
principally O
to O
the O
pressure O
which O
is O
being O
brought O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Government O
by O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
an O
anti O

Jewish O
policy O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
pressure O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Very O
little O
has O
happened O
in O
Prague B-LOC

far O
to O
justify O
the O
panicky O
atmosphere O
which O
has O
prevailed O
in O
Jewish O
circles O
here O
since O
the O
Munich O
agreement O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
Moravia B-LOC
have O
remained O
up O
to O
the O

quite O
unmolested O
both O
in O
their O

their O
economic O
activities O

In O
Slovakia B-LOC

other O
conditions O

Here O
the O
percentage O
of O
Jews O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
is O
higher O
than O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
. O

The O
Slovak B-LOC
Jews O
are O
not O
only O
prominent O
in O
the O
cities O
but O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
situation O
prevailing O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
are O
scattered O
in O
large O
numbers O
throughout O
the O
countryside O
and O
play O
a O
conspicuous O
part O
in O
the O
economic O
life O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
village O
. O

They O
are O
the O
object O
of O
widespread O
resentment O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
population O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
are O
of O
the O
poorer O
orthodox O
type O
. O

Their O
dress O
, O
their O
manners O
and O
their O
habits O
are O
conspicuous O
and O
– O
to O
many O
Slovaks B-LOC
– O
offensive O
. O

They O
are O
prominent O
in O
the O
villages O
as O
money O
- O
lenders O
, O
lawyers O
, O
saloon O
- O
keepers O
, O
druggists O
, O
merchants O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
larger O
cities O
they O
form O
a O
wealthy O
class O
which O
makes O
up O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
intelligentsia O
and O
controls O
a O
very O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
educated O
Jews O
are O
Hungarian B-LOC
-speaking O
and O
have O
always O
looked O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
for O
cultural O
inspiration O
. O

A O
smaller O
but O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
number O
have O
had O
a O
German B-LOC
cultural O
orientation O
. O

This O
doubtless O
explains O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
feeling O
prevalent O
in O
many O
Slovak B-LOC
circles O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
Jews O
have O
always O
sided O
with O
the O
oppressors O
of O
the O
Slovaks B-LOC

against O
the O
native O

[ O
... O

As O
will O
have O
been O
seen O
from O
the O
above O
discussion O
, O
the O
Jewish O
question O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
presents O
a O
highly O
confused O
picture O
. O

The O
Jews O
themselves O
fall O
into O
many O
different O
categories O
, O
varying O
from O
the O
highly O
cultured O
intellectuals O
of O
Prague B-LOC
to O
the O
pious O
and O
primitive O
orthodox O
Jews O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
and O
Ruthenian O
villages O
. O

They O
are O
divided O
among O
various O
cultural O
tendencies O
: O
Yiddish O
, O
German B-LOC
, O
Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
. O

The O
attitude O
of O
the O
Aryan O
population O
toward O
them O
varies O
again O
, O
between O
city O
and O
country O
, O
between O
the O
various O
classes O
and O
professions O
, O
between O
the O
different O
provinces O
. O

In O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
is O
scarcely O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
any O
clear O
- O
cut O
policy O
or O
attitude O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
responsible O
authorities O
will O
emerge O
. O

It O
seems O
evident O
that O
if O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
existed O
in O
a O
vacuum O
the O
Jews O
, O
despite O
their O
considerable O
number O
, O
would O
not O
present O
any O
problem O
which O
could O
not O
be O
solved O
with O
relatively O
humane O
and O
painless O
methods O
. O

The O
country O
does O
not O
contain O
in O
itself O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
really O
serious O
and O
widespread O
anti O

semitic O
movement O

in O

where O
there O
is O

only O
the O

one O

At O
first O

we O

some O
time O

we O
began O
to O
use O

we O
performed O

The O
hygienic O
conditions O
of O
an O
autopsy O
room O
equipped O
in O
such O
a O
way O
were O
very O
bad O
, O
because O
most O
of O
the O
diseases O
in O
the O
camp O
were O
infectious O
, O
and O
there O
were O
several O
cases O
of O
typhoid O
fever O

Around O
February B-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
was O
transferred O
to O
an O
extension O
of O
the O
crematorium O
, O
where O
the O
equipment O
was O
much O
better O
. O

Germans O
allowed O
us O
to O
buy O
two O
marble O
tables O
that O
arrived O
completely O
new O
from O
Hannover B-LOC

We O
also O
got O
more O
instruments O
that O
arrived O
together O
with O
the O
transports O
, O
mainly O
from O
Germany B-LOC

We O
were O
finally O
able O
to O
work O
histologically O
since O
we O
now O
had O
a O
microtome O
. O

We O
used O
updated O
normal O
methods O
, O
and O
chemicals O
as O
possible O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
do O
any O
bacteriological O
analyses O

due O
to O
a O
regulation O
stipulating O
that O
Jews O
weren’t O
allowed O
to O
work O
with O
virulent O
strains O
of O
bacteria O
. O

We O
could O
only O
perform O
bacterioscopy O

other O
bacteriological O

Histological O

were O
added O
to O
the O

A O
special O

was O
kept O

The O

contained O
the O

For O

for O
the O

The O
original O

I O

by O
senior O

I O
will O
allow O
anybody O
to O
look O
into O
it O
anytime O

The O
autopsies O
were O
performed O
lege O
artis O
. O

Tumors O
were O
processed O
histologically O

Pathological O
changes O
that O
couldn’t O
be O

also O
histologically O

They O
were O
always O

by O

Hamperle B-PERS

In O
a O
predetermined O
time O
frame O
that O
I O
can’t O
exactly O
recall O
but O
that O
can O
be O
ascertained O
by O
comparing O
the O
facts O
, O
autopsies O
began O
to O
be O
performed O
on O
all O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
my O
recollections O
, O
was O
first O
implemented O
when O
the O
public O
health O
care O
system O
established O
this O
requirement O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
these O
facts O
can’t O
be O
useful O
for O
normal O
official O
medicine O
, O
because O
the O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
( O
separation O
according O
to O
age O
, O
a O
majority O
of O
sick O
people O
, O
hygienic O
conditions O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
are O
completely O
different O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
small O
historical O
event O
that O
is O
of O
documentary O
value O
only O
for O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

After O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
was O
moved O
to O
the O
crematorium O
, O
the O
corpses O
were O
transferred O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Leichenkammer O
( O
Zentrale O
Leichenkammer O
) O
, O
which O
was O
led O
by O
a O
cabalist O

Burials O
were O
conducted O
like O
this O
: O
about O
8:30 O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
Catholic O
and O
Protestant O
burial O
rites O
were O
held O
first O
in O
a O
special O
chapel O
, O
led O
by O
a O
clergymen O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

Jewish O
burials O
were O
held O
at O
9 O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
another O
room O
, O
officiated O
by O
various O
Rabbis O
. O

The O
rites O
were O
spoken O
only O
rarely O
Czech B-LOC
and O
German B-LOC
, O
and O
otherwise O
the O
masses O
were O
very O
sober O
and O
brief O
. O

After O
the O
coffins O
were O
loaded O
, O
first O
onto O
a O
regular O
flatbed O
truck O
, O
which O
could O
be O
used O
in O
the O
afternoon O
to O
deliver O
bread O
, O
and O
later O
, O
during O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Verschönerung O
onto O
a O
specially O
constructed O
truck O
, O
the O
corpses O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
krematorium O
. O

The O
deceased O
’s O
surviving O
family O
members O
accompanied O
the O
truck O
all O
the O
way O
up O
to O
the O
police O
guard O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
town O
. O

The O
truck O
then O
continued O
along O
the O
road O
and O
turned O
into O
the O
crematorium O
. O

The O
local O
population O
often O
paid O
their O
respects O
to O
the O
dead O
by O
taking O
off O
their O
hats O
. O

Originally O
, O
the O
corpses O
were O
left O
in O
the O
clothes O
they O
had O
on O
when O
they O
died O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
the O
sick O
were O
transported O
in O
bed O
linens O
, O
and O
others O
in O
everyday O
clothes O
and O
shoes O
. O

After O
the O
komandatur O
’ O
s O
order O
, O
the O
corpses O
had O
to O
be O
undressed O
and O
their O
clothes O
taken O
to O
the O
Verteilungsstelle O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
they O
were O
used O
to O
make O
shrouds O
. O

But O
soon O
even O
this O
was O
banned O
and O
the O
dead O
were O
covered O
in O
only O
a O
paper O
jute O
. O

For O
the O
Orthodox O
dead O
, O
hats O
and O
socks O
were O
stitched O
out O
of O
jute O
. O

Doctors O
’ O
jackets O
were O
then O
fashioned O
out O
of O
the O
shrouds O
. O

Coffins O
were O
built O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Reitschule O
, O
originally O
one O
coffin O
for O
each O
corpse O
. O

They O
were O
made O
from O
the O
thinnest O
, O
rough O
boards O
, O
and O
their O
firmness O
depended O
on O
the O
nails O
used O
. O

When O
longer O
nails O
were O
scarce O
, O
so O
- O
called O
paper O
ones O
were O
used O
. O

At O
the O
crematorium O
, O
the O
coffin O
often O
fell O
apart O
completely O
. O

In O
order O
to O
save O
on O
materials O
, O
corpses O
were O
burned O
only O
on O
the O
lid O
of O
the O
coffin O
. O

Then O
the O
coffins O
were O
disinfected O
with O
lysol O
and O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
Zentrale O
Leichenkammer O
for O
further O
use O
. O

The O
corpses O
of O
the O
sick O
and O
corpses O
from O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
same O
coffins O
were O
sent O
, O
were O
burned O
immediately O
. O

The O
organization O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Leichenträgers O
was O
very O
important O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1942 B-DATE
, O
when O
there O
was O
a O
large O
number O
of O
deaths O
. O

This O
is O
how O
it O
went O
: O
corpse O
bearers O
had O
their O
own O
delineated O
sections O
that O
corresponded O
to O
the O
health B-ORG
districts O
led O
by O
the O
various O
head O
doctors O
, O
when O
the O
death O
was O
reported O
. O

The O
bearer O
then O
brought O
the O
corpses O
from O
the O
hospital O
rooms O
and O
residential O
houses O
to O
the O
morgue O
of O
the O
various O
barracks O
. O

From O
there O
, O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
Zentrale O
Leichenkammer O
, O
which O
was O
in O
the O
underground O
hallway O
in O
the O
fortress O
walls O
by O
the O
Bohušovická B-LOC
gate O
. O

Whenever O
the O
death O
rate O
went O
up O
, O
you O
could O
find O
up O
to O
several O
hundred O
corpses O
stored O
in O
an O
undignified O
and O
horrible O
manner O
. O

The O
bodies O
were O
lined O
up O
and O
stacked O
on O
top O
of O
one O
another O
in O
several O
layers O
. O

The O
daily O
death O
rate O
went O
up O
to O
142 O
people O
. O

Until O
the O
crematorium O
was O
built O
, O
corpses O
were O
buried O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
first O
burial O
ground O
was O
the O
first O
row O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Russian B-LOC
cemetery O
, O
then O
in O
the O
space O
between O
the O
Russian B-LOC
cemetery O
and O
the O
path O
. O

The O
crematorium O
had O
4 O
electric O
ovens O
that O
ran O
on O
diesel O
fuel O
. O

They O
were O
put O
into O
operation O
in O
the O
summer O
months O
of O
1942 B-DATE
. O

In O
these O
months O
, O
the O
death O
rate O
was O
so O
high O
that O
– O
although O
all O
4 O
ovens O
were O
working O
day O
and O
night O
( O
one O
cremation O
lasted O
about O
40 O
minutes O
) O
– O
the O
crematorium O
couldn’t O
keep O
up O
and O
the O
bodies O
were O
partly O
buried O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

First O
, O
single O
graves O
were O
dug O
, O
and O
, O
later O
, O
mass O
graves O
. O

The O
location O
for O
the O
cemetery O
was O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
crematorium O
in O
the O
Bohušovická B-LOC
valley O
, O
which O
wasn’t O
suitable O
for O
a O
cemetery O
, O
because O
when O
they O
dug O
to O
a O
depth O
of O
1 O
m O
the O
earth O
was O
so O
damp O
that O
when O
they O
continued O
digging O
the O
graves O
began O
to O
fill O
with O
water O
. O

This O
resulted O
in O
terrible O
difficulties O
when O
the O
bodies O
were O
stacked O
in O
the O
mass O
graves O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
were O
forced O
to O
bury O
them O
were O
loathe O
to O
perform O
this O
task O
. O

The O
corpses O
were O
thrown O
into O
these O
flooded O
graves O
and O
the O
water O
would O
splashed O
all O
around O
them O
. O

Then O
the O
graves O
were O
covered O
with O
chlorinated O
lime O
. O

As O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
, O
burials O
and O
cremations O
couldn’t O
keep O
up O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
time O
when O
several O
hundred O
bodies O
were O
stacked O
in O
the O
Zentral O
Leichenkammer O
. O

When O
the O
death O
rate O
went O
down O
and O
the O
morgue O
was O
empty O
, O
only O
cremations O
continued O
. O

All O
of O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
crematorium O
were O
Jews O
. O

The O
crematorium O
itself O
was O
part O
of O
the O
Instalation B-ORG
und I-ORG
Wärmetechnik I-ORG
division I-ORG
( O
Ing O

Jiří B-PERS
Vogl I-PERS
) O
and O
its O
civil O
servants O
worked O
for O
the O
registry O
( O
Rab O
. O

Ungar B-PERS
) O
. O

The O
crematorium O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
modern O
and O
best O
equipped O
crematoriums O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
doctor O
or O
corpse O
bearer O
pronounced O
death O
, O
a O
so O
- O
called O
Fußzettel O
was O
attached O
to O
the O
body O
and O
the O
head O
doctor O
’ O
s O
office O
issued O
a O
death O
certificate O
that O
traveled O
with O
the O
body O
to O
the O
morgue O
, O
the O
crematorium O
, O
the O
columbarium O
, O
and O
the O
registry O
. O

The O
list O
contained O
all O
of O
the O
facts O
about O
the O
death O
and O
was O
signed O
by O
the O
corpse O
bearers O
that O
brought O
the O
body O
, O
the O
administrator O
of O
the O
central O
morgue O
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
crematorium O
, O
the O
people O
who O
burned O
the O
corpse O
, O
in O
the O
event O
of O
an O
autopsy O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
medial O
research O
room O
, O
and O
the O
administrator O
of O
the O
cemetery O
or O
columbarium O
, O
depending O
on O
whether O
the O
body O
was O
buried O
or O
burned O
. O

The O
crematorium O
maintained O
a O
ledger O
of O
cremations O
in O
the O
incinerator O
as O
did O
the O
office O
of O
the O
registry O
. O

Ashes O
were O
separated O
and O
saved O
in O
paper O
urns O
. O

These O
contained O
the O
ashes O
of O
the O
body O
, O
whose O
name O
and O
cremation O
number O
was O
written O
on O
a O
strip O
of O
paper O
that O
was O
placed O
with O
the O
ashes O
and O
attached O
to O
the O
urn O
. O

The O
urns O
were O
then O
transferred O
from O
the O
crematorium O
to O
the O
columbarium O
that O
was O
located O
in O
the O
underground O
hallway O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Zentrale O
Leichenkammer O
. O

I O
have O
found O
out O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
later O
ordered O
all O
of O
the O
urns O
to O
be O
thrown O
into O
the O
Ohře B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
mention O
2 O
interesting O
incidents O
that O
took O
place O
during O
the O
summer O
months O
of O
1942 B-DATE
, O
when O
many O
old O
and O
sick O
people O
, O
mostly O
from O
Germany B-LOC
, O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Often O
only O
dead O
bodies O
with O
evident O
traces O
of O
violence O
were O
unloaded O
from O
the O
cars O
. O

These O
people O
were O
housed O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Zeughaus O
. O

The O
medical O
services O
in O
this O
house O
, O
which O
was O
quickly O
set O
up O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
were O
very O
poor O
. O

For O
several O
hundred O
sick O
people O
there O
was O
only O
one O
doctor O
. O

But O
the O
nursing O
staff O
was O
quite O
good O
. O

I O
witnessed O
these O
two O
incidents O
: O
A O
nurse O
on O
the O
night O
shift O
thought O
that O
a O
patient O
had O
died O
and O
so O
she O
had O
the O
body O
brought O
to O
the O
morgue O
of O
the O
Podmokelské B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
( I-LOC
Bodenbacher I-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
) I-LOC
. O

The O
presumed O
dead O
person O
woke O
up O
from O
a O
lethargic O
sleep O
to O
find O
herself O
surrounded O
by O
several O
dead O
bodies O
. O

Another O
time O
, O
a O
doctor O
who O
pronounced O
death O
didn’t O
have O
a O
Fusszettel O
with O
him O
and O
so O
he O
wrote O
the O
name O
of O
the O
deceased O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
that O
he O
found O
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

He O
didn’t O
notice O
, O
however O
that O
it O
was O
the O
other O
side O
of O
an O
envelope O
. O

The O
corpse O
bearers O
then O
registered O
the O
body O
under O
the O
name O
that O
was O
on O
the O
envelope O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
different O
name O
than O
the O
deceased O
’ O
s O
true O
name O
. O

The O
error O
was O
found O
out O
and O
fixed O
only O
when O
the O
person O
whose O
name O
was O
registered O
died O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
typical O
and O
delicate O
questions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
the O
question O
of O
gold O
. O

Everyone O
who O
came O
in O
contact O
with O
dead O
bodies O
was O
suddenly O
ordered O
to O
collect O
and O
submit O
precious O
metals O
. O

They O
were O
to O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
court O
, O
the O
section O
charged O
with O
the O
estates O
of O
the O
deceased O
. O

These O
precious O
items O
were O
then O
submitted O
to O
the O
Lagerkommandantur O
. O

Some O
time O
later O
, O
we O
received O
an O
order O
to O
search O
the O
cremains O
for O
precious O
metals O
that O
mostly O
came O
from O
dentures O
and O
filling O
. O

Police O
guards O
from O
the O
crematorium O
building O
were O
present O
when O
the O
ashes O
were O
searched O
. O

Supervised O
by O
Czech B-LOC
police O
, O
the O
ashes O
were O
searched O
and O
examined O
. O

If O
gold O
wasn’t O
found O
, O
Germans B-LOC
conducted O
experiments O
to O
establish O
whether O
the O
metal O
would O
melt O
, O
become O
liquid O
, O
or O
disappear O
at O
such O
high O
temperatures O
. O

The O
experiment O
showed O
that O
gold O
did O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
melt O
and O
could O
not O
be O
found O
. O

Any O
wedding O
rings O
or O
other O
gold O
items O
that O
were O
found O
were O
handed O
over O
. O

No O
gold O
was O
ever O
found O
in O
the O
ashes O
. O

Since O
I O
mentioned O
at O
the O
beginning O
that O
I O
had O
a O
permit O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto O
, O
I O
know O
that O
the O
main O
things O
that O
were O
exported O
from O
the O
ghetto O
were O
textiles O
and O
gold O
, O
which O
mostly O
came O
from O
illegal O
items O
, O
but O
also O
came O
from O
teeth O
. O

Some O
people O
got O
very O
rich O
in O
this O
way O
. O

I O
even O
heard O
of O
someone O
who O
took O
half O
a O
kilogram O
of O
pure O
gold O
with O
him O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

Gold O
was O
exchanged O
for O
food O
and O
cigarettes O
that O
were O
smuggled O
into O
the O
ghetto O
. O

The O
police O
guards O
never O
found O
any O
gold O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
ashes O
were O
searched O
once O
again O
and O
any O
valuable O
items O
were O
removed O
. O

We O
would O
often O
see O
bodies O
brought O
to O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
that O
had O
wounds O
to O
the O
jaw O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
someone O
had O
violently O
pulled O
out O
some O
of O
the O
teeth O
. O

The O
blood O
sedimentation O
showed O
that O
this O
was O
done O
after O
death O
. O

We O
saw O
more O
and O
more O
of O
these O
cases O
until O
Dr O
. O

Munk B-PERS
from O
our O
office O
was O
notified O
. O

He O
took O
the O
necessary O
steps O
to O
prevent O
this O
, O
but O
these O
sad O
cases O
never O
fully O
disappeared O
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
, O
the O
Totenbegleitschein O
that O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
was O
put O
in O
effect O
. O

The O
ghetto O
was O
lucky O
that O
these O
affairs O
never O
reached O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
who O
punished O
such O
infractions O
very O
strictly O
. O

This O
was O
also O
a O
criminal O
offense O
in O
the O
normal O
criminal O
code O
in O
§ O
6 O
on O
the O
violation O
of O
bodies O
. O

The O
Totenbegleitscheins O
protected O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
visited O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
and O
the O
crematorium O
fairly O
often O
. O

Lagerinspektor O
Bergl B-PERS
became O
rather O
fond O
of O
this O
building O
and O
observed O
autopsies O
and O
cremations O
with O
a O
strange O
relish O
. O

He O
was O
always O
very O
well O
behaved O
and O
nothing O
ever O
happened O
. O

He O
would O
sometimes O
stand O
for O
fifteen O
minutes O
without O
moving O
and O
observe O
our O
work O
in O
the O
autopsy O
room O
. O

He O
once O
told O
the O
head O
of O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
Mrs O
. O

Goldmannová B-PERS
: O
Sie O
sind O
aber O
Meisterin O
des O
Messers O
. O

He O
once O
asked O
me O
what O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
death O
of O
the O
corpse O
I O
was O
performing O
an O
autopsy O
on O
. O

When O
I O
told O
him O
that O
it O
was O
erysipelas O
and O
pneumonia O
, O
he O
said O
: O
Das O
heisst O
mein O
Lieber O
aufpassen O
und O
nicht O
sich O
stechen O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
treated O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
and O
crematorium O
much O
better O
than O
they O
did O
anyone O
else O
. O

Once O
, O
I O
was O
stopped O
at O
night O
by O
Heinl B-PERS
, O
who O
demanded O
that O
I O
show O
him O
my O
pass O
. O

When O
I O
said O
that O
I O
was O
an O
employee O
of O
the O
medical O
research O
room O
, O
he O
waved O
his O
hand O
and O
let O
me O
go O
without O
searching O
or O
investigating O
me O
. O

It O
seemed O
that O
in O
this O
building O
they O
realized O
how O
small O
a O
man O
was O
in O
the O
face O
of O
death O
. O

When O
a O
new O
SS O
- O
man O
joined O
the O
camp O
or O
when O
there O
were O
many O
visitors O
, O
they O
were O
taken O
here O
and O
everything O
was O
explained O
to O
them O
. O

The O
first O
press O
trip O
came O
here O
. O

It O
was O
surprising O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
agreed O
with O
our O
wishes O
about O
our O
supplies O
so O
that O
the O
medical O
research O
could O
continue O
working O
relatively O
normally O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
’ I-LOC
leniency O
towards O
us O
meant O
that O
we O
were O
permitted O
to O
establish O
a O
garden O
by O
the O
crematorium O
. O

We O
were O
officially O
allowed O
to O
bring O
the O
vegetables O
we O
raised O
into O
the O
ghetto O
. O

This O
leniency O
also O
extended O
to O
allowing O
us O
to O
take O
photographs O
of O
a O
special O
case O
whenever O
the O
medical O
research O
team O
requested O
it O
. O

Germans B-LOC
even O
ordered O
a O
pathology O
- O
anatomy O
museum O
and O
we O
had O
to O
write O
out O
an O
order O
form O
for O
all O
of O
the O
things O
we O
needed O
for O
it O
, O
which O
was O
hurried O
through O
. O

When O
the O
visit O
of O
the O
foreign O
press O
approached O
and O
the O
museum O
wasn’t O
ready O
yet O
, O
all O
it O
took O
was O
one O
note O
to O
the O
komandatur O
and O
we O
received O
all O
that O
we O
needed O
within O
10 O
days O
. O

Other O
valuable O
preparations O
were O
painted O
by O
Dr O
. O

Rosenthalová B-PERS
( O
Holland B-LOC
) O
and O
a O
collection O
of O
them O
was O
established O
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
, O
corpses O
from O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
and O
the O
Litoměřice B-LOC
labor O
camp O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
crematorium O
. O

Emergency O
corpse O
bearers O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
would O
travel O
to O
the O
fortress B-LOC
to O
collect O
the O
dead O
, O
usually O
Mr O
. O

Oesterreicher B-PERS
. O

I O
would O
open O
the O
casket O
to O
observe O
the O
bodies O
for O
the O
slightest O
of O
reasons O
. O

The O
people O
in O
them O
were O
emaciated O
or O
showed O
signs O
of O
a O
violent O
death O
, O
which O
could O
be O
diagnosed O
from O
their O
surface O
wounds O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
prisoners O
themselves O
brought O
the O
bodies O
. O

They O
were O
immediately O
burned O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
police O
or O
Bergl B-PERS
himself O
. O

We O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
several O
times O
with O
the O
prisoners O
who O
brought O
us O
the O
bodies O
while O
we O
were O
helping O
them O
stack O
them O
. O

They O
told O
us O
: O
be O
careful O
, O
friend O
, O
it O
’s O
heavy O
. O

There O
are O
two O
in O
there O
. O

Twice O
I O
found O
slips O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
in O
the O
casket O
, O
which O
were O
written O
by O
Dr O
. O

Filip B-PERS
, O
according O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
Dr O
. O

Frant B-PERS
. I-PERS

Polák I-PERS
, O
the O
personal O
friend O
of O
Dr O
. O

Filip O
from O
Poděbrady B-LOC
. O

The O
diagnoses O
were O
sepsis O
and O
pneumonia O
. O

The O
ashes O
of O
these O
corpses O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
komandatur O
in O
urns O
with O
the O
cremation O
number O
and O
the O
inscription O
: O
K O

, O
Mann O
Nr O
… O
… O
…… O
. O

Originally O
, O
the O
records O
of O
these O
dead O
bodies O
were O
kept O
in O
the O
crematorium O
and O
registry O
office O
, O
but O
this O
was O
later O
forbidden O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

Autopsies O
of O
these O
dead O
bodies O
were O
never O
performed O
. O

The O
numbers O
can’t O
be O
authoritative O
because O
we O
changed O
the O
way O
we O
numbered O
them O
several O
times O
. O

My O
estimate O
of O
the O
number O
of O
dead O
bodies O
from O
the O
fortress B-LOC
to O
be O
about O
150 O
. O

Epilogue O
In O
the O
past O
several O
days O
, O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
War O
Crimes O
Tribunal O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
has O
sentenced O
the O
first O
forty O
defendants O
. O

As O
you’ve O
likely O
already O
read O
in O
the O
papers O
, O
36 O
people O
were O
sentenced O
to O
death O
by O
hanging O
. O

The O
other O
four O
, O
insignificant O
wachtposts O
, O
received O
life O
sentences O
or O
long O
prison O
sentences O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
important O
verdict O
. O

It O
’s O
even O
better O
than O
the O
one O
from O
Belsen B-CAMP
, O
but O
it O
’s O
also O
much O
more O
than O
we O
could O
have O
expected O
from O
the O
weeks O
- O
long O
trial O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
, O
where O
the O
accused O
SS O
- O
men O
acted O
in O
a O
confident O
and O
sometimes O
rude O
manner O
, O
just O
like O
their O
American B-LOC
defense O
attorneys O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
we O
, O
the O
witnesses O
from O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
did O
was O
to O
tell O
the O
American B-LOC
prosecutor O
, O
lieutenant O
colonel O
Denson B-PERS
, O
that O
we O
were O
very O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
Belsen B-CAMP
trial O
and O
that O
we O
wouldn’t O
like O
to O
take O
part O
in O
a O
similar O
trial O
. O

We O
told O
him O
how O
the O
defense O
attorney O
in O
Belsen B-CAMP
did O
not O
hesitate O
to O
tarnish O
the O
memory O
of O
our O
dead O
friends O
in O
order O
to O
help O
his O
Nazi O
clients O
. O

We O
declared O
that O
we O
would O
immediately O
leave O
the O
courtroom O
and O
wouldn’t O
participate O
in O
any O
other O
trial O
if O
something O
similar O
were O
to O
take O
place O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
. O

He O
assured O
us O
that O
they O
would O
do O
everything O
in O
their O
power O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
trial O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
wouldn’t O
resemble O
the O
British B-LOC
trial O
in O
Belsen B-CAMP
. O

The O
strict O
and O
just O
verdict O
proves O
that O
they O
succeeded O
. O

The O
world O
’s O
outrage O
at O
the O
Belsen B-CAMP
verdict O
also O
had O
a O
significant O
impact O
. O

I O
have O
said O
that O
this O
verdict O
surprised O
us O
and O
I O
think O
we O
must O
explain O
why O
we O
didn’t O
trust O
this O
trial O
very O
much O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
that O
we O
Czech B-LOC
witnesses O
were O
dismayed O
at O
were O
certain O
rules O
established O
by O
the O
court O
prior O
to O
the O
trial O
. O

We O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
speak O
about O
and O
press O
charges O
against O
acts O
committed O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
or O
its O
affiliated O
camps O
( O
Kaufering B-CAMP
etc O
. O

) O
. O

SS O
member O
Moll B-PERS
was O
the O
notorious O
murderer O
of O
thousands O
of O
prisoners O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

After O
it O
was O
evacuated O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
year O
, O
he O
spent O
a O
mere O
five O
weeks O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
. O

He O
could O
only O
be O
prosecuted O
for O
the O
acts O
he O
committed O
during O
these O
5 O
weeks O
. O

Nobody O
was O
allowed O
to O
utter O
a O
single O
word O
about O
his O
past O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

Other O
similar O
limitations O
: O
before O
the O
trial O
, O
only O
offenses O
committed O
after O
1.1.1942 B-DATE
mattered O
. O

If O
SS O
- O
man O
Jarolim B-PERS
proved O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
that O
he O
participated O
in O
the O
shooting O
of O
thousands O
of O
Russians O
, O
but O
that O
it O
occured O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1941 B-DATE
, O
he O
had O
reason O
to O
hope O
that O
he O
would O
be O
freed O
. O

All O
of O
these O
limitations O
led O
to O
grotesque O
pronouncements O
, O
for O
the O
defense O
( O
four O
American O
officers O
and O
one O
German O
attorney O
) O
didn’t O
miss O
a O
single O
opportunity O
to O
help O
their O
clients O
in O
this O
way O
. O

And O
so O
, O
for O
example O
, O
right O
after O
the O
first O
witness O
’s O
testimony O
, O
a O
discussion O
took O
place O
that O
a O
European B-LOC
would O
find O
inconceivable O
. O

After O
the O
occupation O
of O
the O
Dachau B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
( O
April B-DATE
29th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1945 I-DATE
) O
, O
colonel O
Chavez B-PERS
officially O
sent O
me O
to O
uncover O
war O
crimes O
committed O
by O
Germans O
. O

But O
when O
this O
American B-LOC
officer O
wanted O
to O
open O
the O
trial O
by O
describing O
the O
situation O
that O
he O
discovered O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
on O
April B-DATE
30th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1945 I-DATE
, O
he O
was O
immediately O
interrupted O
by O
the O
defense O
, O
who O
claimed O
that O
the O
court O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
concern O
itself O
with O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
camp O
after O
it O
was O
liberated O
, O
and O
so O
therefore O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
investigating O
officer O
was O
irrelevant O
. O

Only O
after O
more O
arguments O
, O
during O
which O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
Chavez B-PERS
wanted O
to O
speak O
about O
the O
prisoners O
who O
died O
after O
liberation O
, O
but O
as O
a O
consequence O
of O
injustices O
committed O
against O
them O
by O
SS O
members O
prior O
to O
April B-DATE
29th I-DATE
, O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
continue O
his O
testimony O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
only O
crimes O
committed O
against O
citizens O
of O
the O
nations O
at O
war O
with O
Germany B-LOC
were O
considered O
criminal O
offenses O
. O

The O
camp O
's O
head O
doctor O
, O
Dr O
. O

Hintermayer B-PERS
, O
didn’t O
deny O
that O
he O
killed O
mentally O
ill O
prisoners O
with O
lethal O
injections O
, O
but O
claimed O
that O
they O
were O
all O
German O
prisoners O
, O
and O
that O
therefore O
it O
was O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
Reich O
’ O
s O
enemies O
. O

This O
grotesque O
theory O
was O
taken O
to O
such O
extremes O
that O
when O
our O
Czech B-LOC
witness O
, O
Dr O
. O

Bláha B-PERS
, O
spoke O
about O
how O
certain O
SS O
doctors O
who O
carried O
out O
experiments O
looked O
forward O
especially O
to O
experimenting O
on O
Roma O
prisoners O
, O
the O
American B-LOC
defense O
attorney O
, O
lieutenant O
colonel O
Bates B-PERS
, O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
that O
the O
Roma O
weren’t O
at O
war O
with O
Germany B-LOC
and O
so O
therefore O
this O
statement O
should O
be O
considered O
irrelevant O
for O
the O
trial O
. O

But O
this O
only O
won O
him O
laughter O
from O
those O
present O
in O
court O
. O

Yet O
he O
still O
tried O
to O
invalidate O
our O
testimony O
, O
because O
we O
, O
too O
, O
hadn’t O
waged O
war O
. O

However O
, O
the O
verdict O
proves O
just O
how O
little O
these O
limitations O
influenced O
the O
judges O
’ O
sense O
of O
justice O
. O

Moll B-PERS
, O
Jarolim B-PERS
, O
Hintermayer B-PERS
were O
hanged O
just O
as O
surely O
as O
commandant O
Weiss B-PERS
, O
who O
spoke O
at O
length O
about O
all O
the O
things O
he O
did O
to O
help O
the O
prisoners O
, O
leading O
the O
prosecutor O
to O
ironically O
ask O
him O
if O
he O
truly O
meant O
to O
claim O
that O
Dachau B-CAMP
was O
a O
sanatorium O
. O

Weiss B-PERS
drew O
himself O
up O
proudly O
and O
stated O
: O
Dachau O
war O
ein O
gutes O
Lager O
! O
( O
Dachau B-CAMP
was O
a O
good O
camp O
! O
) O
The O
great O
political O
significance O
of O
this O
trial O
lies O
not O
in O
the O
proceedings O
themselves O
, O
which O
were O
often O
tarnished O
by O
the O
intolerable O
efforts O
of O
the O
defense O
and O
its O
witnesses O
, O
but O
in O
the O
judges O
’ O
final O
approach O
to O
the O
problem O
. O

The O
verdict O
vindicated O
the O
prosecutor O
, O
who O
constantly O
repeated O
that O
these O
defendants O
should O
not O
be O
tried O
for O
the O
crimes O
they O
individually O
decided O
to O
commit O
against O
the O
prisoners O
, O
but O
should O
be O
sentenced O
to O
death O
simply O
because O
they O
belonged O
to O
an O
organization O
whose O
main O
goal O
was O
to O
murder O
and O
torture O
political O
opponents O
and O
prisoners O
of O
war O
. O

This O
theory O
won O
out O
in O
the O
end O
. O

If O
the O
Dachau B-CAMP
trial O
will O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
any O
kind O
of O
precedent O
, O
it O
will O
be O
that O
of O
the O
ultimate O
Czech B-LOC
punishment O
for O
every O
German B-LOC
, O
whether O
an O
SS O
member O
or O
capo O
, O
who O
is O
found O
to O
have O
been O
connected O
in O
any O
way O
to O
the O
running O
of O
the O
concentration O
camps O
. O

And O
last O
but O
certainly O
not O
least O
, O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
witnesses O
was O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
the O
court O
made O
such O
a O
significant O
ruling O

Upon O

the O

Mr O

Hacar B-PERS

told O
me O
that O
he O
won’t O

for O

until O
he O
receives O
confirmation O
of O
the O
nationality O
of O

Upon O
my O
question O
of O
what O
about O
those O
who O
have O
confirmed O
their O
Jewish O
nationality O
, O
Mr O
. O

Hacar B-PERS
answered O
: O
For O
me O
, O
Jewish O
nationality O
doesn’t O
count O
because O
it O
’s O
just O
something O
clever O
that O
Jews O
do O
in O
order O
to O
decide O
what O
side O
they’re O
on O
. O

I O
answered O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
president B-PERS
of O
the O
republic B-LOC
and O
the O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
government O
’ O
s O
decision O
, O
Jews O
were O
granted O
equal O
rights O
and O
so O
his O
opinion O
was O
wrong O
. O

Mr O
. O

Hacar B-PERS
then O
told O
me O
: O
Our O
Association O
is O
for O
our O
people O
only O
and O
not O
you O
who O
were O
only O
persecuted O

When O
I O
retorted O
that O
we O

, O
Mr O

Hacar B-PERS
threatened O
to O
throw O
me O
down O

on O

on O

that O

but O
to O
all O
of O

For O

I O
spent O
3 O
years O

Hitler B-PERS

army O
had O
already O

Moravia B-LOC
for O
two O
years O
and O
the O
oppression O
of O
the O
population O
, O
especially O
the O
Jews O
, O
was O
increasing O
day O
by O
day O
. O

We O
heard O
in O
Prague B-LOC
that O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
Moravian B-LOC
Ostrava I-LOC
and O
other O
cities O
large O
deportation O
transports O
of O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
Poland B-LOC
and O
were O
resettled O
there O
in O
so O
- O
called O
ghettos O
, O
where O
they O
lived O
crammed O
together O
and O
suffered O
from O
hunger O
and O
cold O
as O
well O
as O
a O
lack O
of O
hygiene O
and O
were O
cut O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

The O
news O
would O
not O
keep O
it O
quiet O
that O
a O
general O
deportation O
of O
all O
Jews O
was O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
bit O
by O
bit O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
soon O
started O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
emigration O
files O
had O
to O
be O
filled O
out O
and O
all O
mobile O
and O
mobile O
property O
had O
to O
be O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Nazi O
authorities O
. O

Then O
every O
1000 O
people O
were O
gathered O
around O
every O
fourth O
day O
in O
the O
Prague B-LOC
exhibition O
centre O
, O
each O
of O
whom O
could O
bring O
luggage O
with O
a O
total O
weight O
of O
50 O
kg O
, O
as O
well O
as O
bedding O
and O
had O
to O
leave O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
belongings O
and O
furniture O
in O
the O
apartment O
and O
hand O
over O
the O
keys O
. O

There O
were O
5 O
transports O
from O
Prague B-LOC
and O
1 O
transport O
to O
Poland B-LOC
/Leda/ O
from O
Brno B-LOC
and O
the O
fear O
and O
confusion O
was O
a O
general O
one O
. O

Objects O
that O
had O
become O
worthless O
were O
quickly O
sold O
secretly O
/this O
was O
officially O
forbidden/ O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
a O
number O
of O
objects O
recommended O
by O
the O
Jewish O
religious O
community O
in O
Prague B-LOC
were O
bought O
, O
so O
that O
in O
a O
short O
time O
all O
Prague B-LOC
shops O
selling O
these O
articles O
were O
sold O
out O
and O
everyone O
was O
preparing O
for O
the O
transport O
. O

Mainly O
these O
were O
suitcases O
, O
rucksacks O
, O
bread O
bags O
, O
warm O
clothes O
and O
laundry O
, O
high O
Canadian O

, O
medicines O
, O
stoves O
, O
canteens O
, O
lamps O
, O
devices O
and O
tools O
and O
the O
like O
. O

Officially O
, O
nothing O
was O
ever O
said O
about O
the O
place O
of O
arrival O
, O
so O
the O
wildest O
rumors O
were O
in O
circulation O
/including O
that O
the O
men O
would O
be O
separated O
from O
the O
women O
, O
that O
the O
baggage O
carts O
would O
be O
uncoupled O
and O
the O
like O
. O

/ O
The O
transports O
were O
put O
together O
by O
the O
religious O
community O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
SS O
and O
anyone O
who O
had O
no O
protection O
there O
was O
soon O
placed O
in O
such O
a O
transport O
. O

Particularly O
wealthy O
people O
or O
people O
who O
were O
particularly O
unpopular O
with O
the O
Nazis O
were O
classified O
individually O
or O
by O
family O
according O
to O
special O
instructions O
. O

This O
is O
how O
my O
family O
came O
to O
fill O
out O
the O
file O
after O
some O
of O
my O
dearest O
friends O
had O
already O
been O
deported O
. O

On O
November B-DATE
27 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
, O
I O
had O
to O
equip O
my O
poor O
old O
mother O
because O
she O
had O
received O
the O
transport O
order O
without O
my O
volunteer O
report O
being O
taken O
into O
account O
and O
she O
moved O
into O
the O

. O

On O
December B-DATE
1st I-DATE
this O
transport O
left O
for O
an O
unknown O
destination O
, O
but O
immediately O
afterwards O
the O
news O
spread O
that O
a O
ghetto O
would O
be O
established O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
that O
this O
transport O
that O
had O
just O
departed O
was O
already O
going O
to O
this O
ghetto O
. O

Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
as O
construction O
commando O
I O
from O
there O
to O
make O
the O
facilities O
and O
preparations O
. O

A O
second O
construction O
commando O
transport O
of O
1000 O
men O
was O
also O
to O
be O
assembled O
and O
the O
religious O
community O
and O
the O
SS O
promised O
those O
who O
took O
part O
in O
this O
transport O
that O
they O
would O
have O
a O
preferred O
position O
as O
assembly O

in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
that O
their O
wives O
would O
be O
sent O
along O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

I O
then O
signed O
up O
to O
be O
close O
to O
my O
mother O
again O
. O

I O
moved O
into O
the O
exhibition O
grounds O
on O
December B-DATE
1 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
and O
my O
wife O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
place O
where O
we O
said O
goodbye O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
. O

The O
suitcases O
were O
put O
in O
a O
magazine O
and O
were O
to O
be O
transported O
separately O
. O

I O
also O
had O
a O
rucksack O
, O
1 O
bread O
bag O
and O
1 O
bed O
roll O
. O

We O
were O
crammed O
together O
in O
the O
cold O
and O
dirty O
rooms O
, O
some O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
some O
on O
old O
, O
greasy O
mattresses O
or O
on O
wooden O
beds O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
3 O
days O
we O
had O
to O
sign O
all O
possible O
declarations O
of O
surrender O
and O
waiver O
for O
movable O
and O
immovable O
property O
, O
papers O
, O
insurances O
, O
claims O

and O
were O
asked O
to O
deliver O
all O
personal O
documents O
, O
money O
, O
cigarettes O
, O
tobacco O
, O
medicines O
, O
spirits O
. O

These O
objects O
piled O
up O
to O
form O
small O
mountains O
on O
the O
tables O
, O
and O
yet O
there O
were O
many O
people O
who O
did O
not O
give O
up O
everything O
or O
gave O
up O
nothing O
and O
cheated O
their O
way O
through O
. O

Some O
were O
caught O
doing O
this O
and O
severely O
slapped O
by O
the O
SS O
- O
Scharführer O
Fiedler B-PERS
and O
Burger B-PERS
. O

All O
transport O
work O
( O
manual O
and O
administrative O
) O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Jews O
themselves O
, O
who O
had O
strict O
instructions O
from O
the O
SS O
. O

Sometimes O
Jews O
from O
the O
administration O
, O
especially O
Mr O
. O

Mandler B-PERS
, O
excelled O
very O
ingloriously O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
- O
more O
papal O
than O
the O
Pope O
- O
even O
made O
the O
orders O
stricter O
and O
very O
often O
beat O
his O
fellow O
sufferers O
himself O
. O

I O
remember O
very O
well O
his O
shiny O
leather O
coat O
and O
his O
domineering O
flailing O
with O
a O
huge O
daimon O
focus O
wide O
beam O
lamp O
. O

/This O
gentleman O
later O
came O
to O
the O
ghetto O
and O
was O
duly O
rewarded O
with O
heavy O
blows O
and O
slaps O
in O
the O
face O
immediately O
after O
arrival O
so O
that O
he O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
go O
out O
into O
the O
street O
, O
but O
by O
order O
of O
the O
SS O
he O
was O
declared O
a O
prominent O
figure O
and O
then O
held O
a O
high O
position./ O
On O
the O
second O
day O
the O
hairs O
of O
our O
heads O
were O
shaved O
off O
and O
since O
it O
had O
just O
gotten O
very O
cold O
, O
we O
all O
froze O
pitifully O
, O
as O
we O
had O
to O
walk O
around O
with O
our O
heads O
uncovered O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
December O
4th O
, O
we O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
Bubny B-LOC
train O
station O
at O
7 O
a.m O
. O

under O
protective B-ORG
police I-ORG
guard I-ORG
and O
were O
put O
in O
a O
car O
. O

At O
4 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
we O
arrived O
in O
Bauschowitz B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
working O
group O
of O
our O
friends O
from O
assembly O
commando O
I O
, O
who O
had O
been O
sent O
ahead O
, O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
to O
arrange O
the O
luggage O
transport O
. O

We O
then O
walked O
4 O
km O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
where O
we O
were O
quartered O
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
Barracks I-LOC
, O
which O
had O
been O
abandoned O
by O
soldiers O
. O

The O
people O
from O
the O
first O
transport O
were O
standing O
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
this O
barracks O
and O
there O
- O
then O
I O
saw O
my O
1 O
. O

mother O
, O
who O
was O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
me O
here O
. O

We O
were O
assigned O
huge O
halls O
with O
concrete O
floors O
on O
the O
top O
floor O
for O
about O
300 O
- O
400 O
people O
each O
and O
were O
occupied O
with O
mattresses O
. O

The O
previous O
mixed O
transport O
lived O
on O
the O
lower O
floor O
in O
smaller O
rooms O
with O
wooden O
floors O
for O
around O
25 O
- O
40 O
people O
each O
. O

A O
mixed O
transport O
from O
Brno B-LOC
of O
1,000 O
people O
that O
arrived O
on O
the O
same O
day O
was O
also O
quartered O
in O
one O
of O
the O
uppermost O
halls O
. O

Everyone O
was O
busy O
with O
feeding O
themselves O
as O
well O
as O
possible O
from O
the O
food O
they O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
, O
because O
the O
food O
that O
was O
initially O
provided O
was O
very O
poor O
. O

The O
kitchen O
was O
not O
yet O
well O
organized O
, O
the O
barracks O
kettles O
were O
not O
enough O
for O
the O
3340 O
people O
and O
the O
potato O
peeling O
went O
very O
slowly O
, O
so O
we O
all O
had O
to O
help O
. O

4 O
washrooms O
, O
with O
around O
100 O
taps O
, O
and O
4 O
toilets O
with O
around O
20 O
cubicles O
were O
available O
, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
always O
had O
to O
queue O
to O
attend O
to O
our O
needs O
or O
to O
get O
lunch O
, O
which O
was O
very O
uncomfortable O
with O
the O
prevailing O
strong O
frost O
. O

Considering O
that O
further O
transports O
had O
been O
announced O
, O
the O
women O
were O
then O
moved O
to O
another O
barracks O
/ O
Dresdner B-LOC
/. O
Then O
the O
news O
spread O
that O
a O
separate O
transport O
of O
25 O
prominent O
people O
from O
the O
Prague B-LOC
religious O
community O
had O
arrived O
, O
from O
which O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Council O
of O
Elders O
and O
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
other O
capable O
people O
, O
the O
staff O
to O
support O
it O
should O
be O
formed O
. O

This O
institution O
, O
which O
was O
supposed O
to O
represent O
a O
kind O
of O
small O
government O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
was O
entrusted O
by O
the O
SS O
with O
the O
autonomous O
administration O
of O
the O
ghetto O
. O

This O
Council O
of O
Elders O
included O
: O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein B-PERS
with O
the O
title O
Judenältester O
, O
Engineer O
Zucker B-PERS
, O
Dr O
. O

Munk B-PERS
, O
Dr O
. O

Egon B-PERS
Popper I-PERS
, O
Schliesser B-PERS
, O
Fredy B-PERS
Hirsch I-PERS
, O
Klaber B-PERS
, O
Freiberger B-PERS
and O
others O
, O
and O
was O
divided O
into O
individual O
departments O
such O
as O
the O
Central O
Secretariat O
, O
Internal O
Administration O
, O
Security O
, O
Health O
, O
Youth O
Welfare O
, O
Economic O
Department O
, O
Work O
Center O
, O
Production O
, O
etc O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
these O
departments O
were O
created O
gradually O
and O
were O
subject O
to O
many O
changes O
, O
as O
did O
the O
service O
they O
provided O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
heavy O
responsibility O
that O
often O
seemed O
intolerable O
, O
and O
their O
bosses O
often O
changed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
continuing O
fluctuation O
caused O
by O
transports O
. O

Since O
my O
mother O
moved O
to O
the O
Dresdner B-LOC
barracks O
with O
the O
other O
women O
, O
I O
was O
separated O
from O
her O
again O
. O

The O
barracks O
were O
guarded O
by O
Czech B-LOC
gendarmes O
who O
had O
their O
guard O
rooms O
at O
the O
exit O
gates O
. O

You O
could O
only O
leave O
the O
barracks O
with O
a O
special O
pass O
. O

Such O
passes O
were O
given O
to O
people O
from O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
, O
the O
staff O
, O
craftsmen O
or O
people O
who O
had O
to O
do O
any O
work O
outside O
the O
barracks O
on O
orders O
, O
or O
to O
closed O
work O
columns O
who O
marched O
off O
militarily O
and O
passed O
numerically O
on O
a O
collective O
pass O
with O
which O
the O
column O
leader O
identified O
himself O
. O

Since O
I O
was O
not O
yet O
on O
the O
job O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
I O
could O
get O
to O
Mother O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
be O
included O
in O
one O
of O
the O
work O
columns O
that O
went O
to O
the O
Dresdner B-LOC
barracks O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O

At O
least O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
written O
messages O
over O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

Two O
weeks O
passed O
and O
further O
transports O
from O
Prague B-LOC
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Each O
transport O
was O
labeled O
alphabetically O
and O
consisted O
of O
1,000 O
people O
of O
mixed O
ages O
and O
genders O
. O

Only O
the O
two O
construction O
commando O
transports O
, O
which O
consisted O
only O
of O
men O
and O
whose O
members O
had O
a O
privileged O
position O
in O
the O
ghetto O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
retained O
the O
transport O
designations O
AK O
I O
and O
AK O
II O
. O

Many O
of O
our O
wives O
arrived O
with O
another O
transport O
, O
and O
we O
saw O
they O
pass O
by O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
our O
barracks O
. O

My O
wife O
Mana B-PERS
also O
arrived O
with O
some O
friends O
in O
mid- O
December B-DATE
and O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
about O
her O
invitations O
. O

Since O
the O
barracks O
that O
had O
been O
open O
so O
far O
were O
not O
enough O
, O
another O
one O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Hohenelber B-LOC
barracks O
, O
was O
vacated O
; O
the O
Bodenbacher B-LOC
, O
Magdeburger B-LOC
, O
Hamburger B-LOC
and O
Hanover B-LOC
barracks O
could O
later O
be O
opened O
, O
the O
Kavalier B-LOC
barracks O
became O
an O
old O
people O
's O
home O
, O
hospital O
was O
established O
in O
the O
Hohenelber B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
Magdeburg B-LOC
barracks O
were O
made O
available O
exclusively O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
and O
staff O
with O
their O
families O
, O
where O
they O
gradually O
made O
themselves O
comfortable O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
the O
Aussiger B-LOC
and O
Jäger B-LOC
barracks O
were O
schleusse O
barracks O
where O
incoming O
transports O
were O
received O
and O
outgoing O
shipments O
were O
dispatched O
. O

For O
me O
the O
problem O
of O
getting O
to O
my O
wife O
and O
mother O
had O
become O
a O
burning O
problem O
and O
finally O
, O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
some O
friends O
, O
I O
joined O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Transporthunderschaft O
, O
which O
the O
two O
youth O
leaders O
from O
the O
retraining O
camp O
Linden O
Erwin B-PERS
Mautner I-PERS
and O
Franz B-PERS
Peschau I-PERS
led O
. O

They O
kept O
the O
group O
together O
in O
military O
discipline O
and O
organized O
the O
heavy O
transport O
work O
. O

In O
this O
way O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
out O
of O
our O
barracks O
in O
a O
closed O
working O
group O
and O
to O
get O
into O
the O
women O
’ O
s O
barracks O
and O
talk O
to O
mother O
and O
wife O
almost O
every O
day O
, O
which O
lifted O
my O
initially O
depressed O
mood O
a O
little O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
also O
brought O
some O
groceries O
with O
her O
and O
cooked O
dumplings O
, O
semolina O
porridge O
, O
and O
noodles O
on O
the O
primitive O
cooker O
she O
had O
brought O
with O
her O
, O
and O
we O
ate O
together O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
the O
very O
slim O
rations O
, O
which O
only O
consisted O
of O
bread O
, O
potatoes O
, O
water O
soup O
, O
a O
little O
margarine O
and O
every O
10 O
- O
14 O
days O
something O
like O
5 O
dk O
meat O
or O
salami O
was O
slightly O
improved O
. O

Often O
we O
worked O
days O
and O
nights O
/15 O
- O
20 O
hours/ O
handling O
the O
incoming O
transports O
before O
we O
had O
anything O
to O
eat O
, O
as O
the O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Brno B-LOC
residents O
had O
meanwhile O
learned O
from O
illegal O
messages O
that O
the O
luggage O
was O
not O
being O
taken O
away O
, O
but O
was O
being O
handled O
correctly O
and O
as O
a O
result O
many O
transport O
participants O
did O
not O
bring O
50 O
kg O
, O
but O
500 O
- O
600 O
kg O
/ O
I O
remember O
seeing O
people O
who O
took O
11 O
, O
16 O
and O
even O
20 O
suitcases O
with O
them O
/ O
This O
of O
course O
dragged O
out O
the O
unloading O
work O
and O
distributing O
it O
to O
the O
recipients O
. O

Because O
the O
everyman O
newcomer O
, O
who O
we O
worked O
for O
for O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
saw O
that O
there O
was O
not O
much O
food O
provided O
here O
, O
and O
eventually O
everyone O
was O
just O
happy O
to O
get O
their O
suitcase O
and O
backpack O
out O
of O
the O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
pieces O
of O
luggage O
, O
the O
nice O
custom O
arose O
to O
reward O
us O
with O
the O
food O
that O
had O
been O
brought O
along O
, O
which O
of O
course O
was O
very O
welcome O
. O

All O
the O
more O
so O
since O
the O
efforts O
of O
our O
Hunderschaftsführer O
to O
get O
a O
little O
more O
food O
for O
our O
hard O
work O
were O
not O
taken O
into O
account O
by O
the O
administration O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

So O
came O
the O
first O
Christmas O
and O
New O
Years O
, O
which O
we O
tried O
to O
celebrate O
with O
more O
or O
less O
humor O
despite O
the O
uncomfortable O
situation O
in O
which O
we O
were O
. O

The O
men O
had O
more O
success O
because O
musical O
instruments O
had O
also O
been O
passed O
around O
and O
music O
was O
often O
played O
in O
the O
halls O
or O
rooms O
of O
the O
men O
’ O
s O
barracks O
. O

All O
barracks O
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
objects O
outside O
, O
were O
guarded O
by O
gendarmes O
to O
prevent O
any O
contact O
with O
the O
civilian O
population O
. O

This O
did O
not O
always O
succeed O
, O
and O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people O
on O
the O
various O
work O
details O
, O
such O
as O
the O
railway O
and O
the O
like O
, O
smuggled O
in O
food O
, O
money O
, O
and O
tobacco O
. O

The O
risk O
was O
great O
and O
the O
prices O
on O
the O
black O
market O
were O
correspondingly O
high O
. O

A O
loaf O
of O
bread O
cost O
K O
80 O
to O
100 O
. O

Cigarettes O
rose O
from O
K O
4.50 O
to O
K O
8 O
, O
later O
to O
12 O
, O
15 O
, O
25 O
- O
at O
which O
level O
they O
stayed O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
then O
rose O
even O
further O
. O

The O
gendarmes O
behaved O
relatively O
decently O
, O
when O
one O
got O
to O
know O
individuals O
better O
some O
helped O
with O
smuggling O
and O
the O
like O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
, O
including O
the O
commander O
Oberleutnant O
Janeček B-PERS
, O
and O
the O
sergeants O
Sykora B-PERS
, O
Drahonovsky B-PERS
, O
Simandl B-PERS
and O
others O
, O
who O
were O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
or O
were O
in O
thrall O
to O
the O
Nazis O
, O
went O
very O
hard O
and O
arrested O
many O
of O
our O
people O
for O
violations O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
to O
the O
German O
authorities O
. O

The O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
/a O
temporary O
concentration O
camp O
near O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
/ O
was O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
. O

To O
give O
a O
frightening O
example O
, O
one O
day O
SS O
Obersturmbannführer O
Bergel B-PERS
and O
the O
camp O
commandant O
SS O
- O
Hauptsturmführer O
Seidl B-PERS
hanged O
9 O
and O
then O
7 O
young O
men O
because O
of O
violations O
/ O
unauthorized O
traffic O
with O
civilians O
, O
smuggling O
groceries O
to O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

, O
possession O
of O
money O
or O
cigarettes O
, O
shopping O
in O
Ther B-GHETTO
. O

business O
, O
sending O
or O
receiving O
black O
letters O
etc O
. O

/ O
on O
a O
gallows O
in O
front O
of O
the O
entire O
Council O
of O
Elders O
. O

The O
execution O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
a O
Jew O
, O
the O
notorious O
former O
butcher O
Fischer B-PERS
, O
who O
later O
also O
acquired O
a O
bad O
reputation O
for O
badly O
treating O
his O
fellow O
sufferers O
. O

In O
order O
to O
maintain O
peace O
and O
order O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
the O
security O
system O
was O
created O
and O
placed O
under O
the O
direction O
of O
Messrs O
. O

Klaber B-PERS
, O
Kominik B-PERS
and O
Komita B-PERS
. O

When O
a O
story O
with O
money O
or O
cigarettes O
was O
discovered O
, O
Klaber B-PERS
was O
deposed O
and O
imprisoned O
for O
6 O
months O
. O

His O
successor O
was O
Löwenstein B-PERS
, O
the O
former O
police O
chief O
of O
the O
Minsk B-GHETTO
ghetto O
, O
who O
was O
also O
imprisoned O
in O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
. O

He O
later O
had O
an O
affair O
and O
was O
locked O
up O
. O

His O
deputy O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
Frey B-PERS
. O

He O
did O
not O
officiate O
for O
long O
and O
then O
a O
former O
Reich O
German O
police O
judge O
named O
Rosenthal B-PERS
came O
to O
the O
helm O
, O
who O
held O
up O
until O
the O
time O
of O
my O
departure O
and O
was O
quite O
popular O
and O
truly O
served O
justice O
to O
the O
best O
of O
his O
ability O
. O

The O
SS O
, O
too O
, O
never O
objected O
to O
his O
administration O
. O

The O
security O
system O
had O
2 O
departments O
, O
namely O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
- O
a O
kind O
of O
city O
police O
, O
which O
was O
responsible O
for O
guarding O
the O
barracks O
and O
Jewish O
objects O
together O
with O
the O
Czech B-LOC
gendarmes O
and O
whose O
uniform O
consisted O
of O
a O
belt O
and O
a O
black O
cap O
with O
high O
edges O
and O
a O
yellow O
stripe O
. O

Both O
were O
worn O
with O
the O
other O
civilian O
clothes O
and O
looked O
a O
little O
strange O
, O
but O
we O
soon O
got O
used O
to O
them O
. O

The O
second O
department O
was O
the O
Kripo B-ORG
or O
Kriminalwache B-ORG
- O
which O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
uncovering O
of O
thefts O
and O
other O
offenses O
or O
crimes O
as O
well O
as O
contraband O
violations O
- O
to O
circumvent O
regulations O
in O
favor O
of O
fellow O
sufferers O
with O
mildness O
, O
but O
there O
were O
also O
some O
individuals O
who O
- O
more O
papal O
than O
the O
Pope O
- O
insisted O
on O
an O
unnecessary O
harshness O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
for O
fear O
of O
inconveniencing O
themselves O
, O
reported O
many O
of O
their O
fellow O
sufferers O
and O
brought O
down O
severe O
punishment O
by O
the O
superior O
authorities O
/the O
Nazi O
SS O
/ O
if O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
handle O
the O
individual O
cases O
by O
either O
carrying O
out O
the O
sentences O
or O
covering O
up O
the O
cases O
internally O
, O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
Jewish O
self O
- O
government O
security O
system O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
had O
got O
used O
to O
this O
strange O
life O
a O
little O
and O
I O
always O
met O
my O
wife O
and O
mother O
in O
the O
Dresdner B-LOC
barracks O
. O

My O
wife O
sometimes O
worked O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
cleaning O
crew O
, O
whose O
work O
included O
washing O
floors O
and O
corridors O
in O
the O
men O
’ O
s O
barracks O
so O
that O
she O
could O
also O
get O
to O
me O
in O
the O
barracks O
, O
or O
we O
met O
while O
the O
unloading O
potatoes O
in O
the O
protective O
walls O
, O
where O
the O
big O
potato O
stores O
were O
, O
or O
in O
barracks O
cellars O
, O
where O
they O
were O
stored O
. O

More O
transports O
came O
. O

If O
at O
the O
beginning O
pieces O
of O
luggage O
were O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
transport O
participants O
without O
further O
ado O
, O
a O
drastic O
change O
took O
place O
at O
that O
time O
. O

As O
already O
said O
, O
after O
receiving O
black O
messages O
that O
everything O
was O
going O
perfectly O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
the O
transport O
participants O
brought O
more O
and O
more O
luggage O
with O
them O
, O
so O
that O
one O
day O
the O
Nazis O
left O
three O
quarters O
of O
the O
total O
amount O
of O
luggage O
at O
the O
departure O
station O
, O
as O
they O
didn’t O
want O
to O
make O
any O
more O
wagons O
available O
. O

Later O
, O
becoming O
wiser O
from O
the O
bad O
experiences O
of O
others O
, O
transport O
participants O
adhered O
to O
the O
prescribed O
50 O
kg O
. O

Second O
, O
an O
examination O
of O
all O
persons O
and O
all O
luggage O
for O
contraband O
was O
now O
carried O
out O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Nazis O
, O
i.e O
. O

to O
articles O
whose O
possession O
or O
use O
we O
Jews O
were O
forbidden O
according O
to O
Nazis O
regulations O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
money O
, O
valuables O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
tobacco O
, O
cigarettes O
, O
smoking O
accessories O
, O
matches O
, O
pipes O
, O
instruments O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
chemicals O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
medicines O
/some O
of O
which O
, O
however O
, O
were O
delivered O
to O
the O
hospital O
/ O
hard O
alcohol O
, O
stoves O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
in O
particular O
electric O
stoves O
, O
cords O
and O
contacts O
, O
all O
kinds O
of O
rubber O
goods O
such O
as O
tubes O
, O
thermophores O
, O
enemas O
, O
preservatives O
, O
thermo O
bottles O
, O
cosmetic O
preparations O
of O
all O

such O
as O

, O
Odol O
, O

, O
candles O
, O
food O
in O
perfectly O
preserved O
condition O
, O
especially O
tin O
cans O
, O
as O
well O
as O
whole O
salamis O
. O

These O
goods O
were O
confiscated O
from O
the O
luggage O
by O
the O
gendarmes O
, O
to O
whom O
Jewish O
ghetto O
guards O
had O
to O
provide O
manual O
assistance O
, O
and O
criminal B-ORG
police I-ORG
guards I-ORG
had O
to O
monitor O
the O
proceedings O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
very O
benevolent O
and O
often O
left O
half O
of O
the O
transport O
unchecked O
, O
and O
in O
the O
baggage O
they O
searched O
they O
left O
half O
of O
the O
objects O
to O
be O
confiscated O
either O
from O
insufficient O
knowledge O
or O
out O
of O
benevolent O
convenience O
. O

They O
almost O
always O
took O
away O
only O
cigarettes O
, O
spirits O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
because O
they O
themselves O
were O
the O
intended O
beneficiaries O
and O
since O
they O
only O
committed O
this O
little O
theft O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
Jews O
/ O
ghetto O
guards O
and O
Kripo B-ORG
/ O
instead O
of O
delivering O
the O
goods O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
in O
return O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
so O
they O
otherwise O
handled O
the O
investigation O
of O
the O
other O
contraband O
items O
benevolently O
. O

With O
the O
intercession O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guards O
, O
it O
was O
even O
often O
possible O
to O
get O
objects O
that O
had O
already O
been O
confiscated O
from O
friends O
and O
relatives O
. O

The O
searches O
took O
place O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Shleusskaserne O
, O
where O
the O
transports O
were O
schleussed O
, O
those O
of O
the O
Kavalier B-LOC
barracks O
, O
an O
old O
, O
elongated O
, O
low O
structure O
with O
rooms O
that O
resembled O
crypts O
and O
in O
which O
a O
huge O
old O
people O
’s O
home O
for O
about O
2000 O
- O
2300 O
people O
was O
later O
set O
up O
. O

who O
slept O
in O
double O
beds O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
. O

Later O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
became O
the O
Shleusskaserne O
. O

The O
confiscated O
contraband O
was O
carried O
by O
ghetto O
guards O
- O
later O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Transporthundertschaft O
- O
under O
guard O
by O
the O
gendarmerie O
to O
their O
/the O
gendarmes O
/ O
barracks O
. O

On O
the O
way O
there O
, O
objects O
of O
the O
confiscated O
goods O
were O
often O
stolen O
by O
the O
gendarmes O
or O
ghetto O
guards O
by O
mutual O
agreement O
, O
which O
was O
not O
immoral O
after O
all O
, O
since O
this O
formerly O
Jewish O
property O
had O
become O
Nazis O
property O
after O
the O
confiscation O
and O
by O
passing O
it O
on O
the O
Nazis O
robbery O
got O
smaller O
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
thus O
made O
more O
friendly O
towards O
the O
Jews O
and O
carried O
out O
their O
duties O
with O
less O
severity O
. O

Over O
time O
almost O
every O
gendarme O
stood O
with O
a O
larger O
number O
of O
ghetto O
guards O
- O
or O
later O
in O
business O
relationships O
with O
members O
of O
the O
Transporthundertschaft O
, O
and O
these O
business O
relationships O
were O
then O
used O
again O
to O
make O
the O
gendarmerie O
docile O
and O
benevolent O
when O
smuggling O
money O
, O
food O
and O
the O
like O
from O
outside O
into O
the O
ghetto O
. O

With O
a O
transport O
of O
1000 O
people O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
mood O
, O
the O
gendarmes O
confiscated O
about O
5 O
- O
6 O
100 O
kg O
boxes O
of O
contraband O
, O
which O
, O
viewed O
from O
the O
right O
perspective O
, O
was O
actually O
not O
much O
, O
as O
one O
transport O
sometimes O
contained O
up O
to O
200,000 O
kg O
of O
luggage O
. O

One O
day O
the O
Nazis O
ordered O
a O
further O
tightening O
and O
from O
now O
on O
all O
suitcases O
from O
the O
transport O
participants O
were O
confiscated O
and O
stored O
in O
the O
Aussiger B-LOC
barracks O
. O

There O
they O
were O
then O
gradually O
opened O
, O
all O
their O
contents O
sorted O
out O
and O
stored O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
closet O
. O

There O
were O
special O
departments O
for O
clothes O
, O
underwear O
, O
shoes O
and O
all O
those O
things O
that O
were O
not O
contraband O
. O

The O
contraband O
was O
taken O
away O
, O
most O
of O
the O
medicines O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
Jewish O
central O
pharmacy O
, O
the O
food O
, O
if O
it O
was O
not O
ready O
for O
use O
, O
was O
put O
in O
the O
central O
provisions O
for O
consumption O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
but O
if O
it O
was O
ready O
for O
use O
, O
it O
was O
taken O
by O
everyone O
who O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O

that O
nothing O

left O
for O

. O

Leather O

, O

Objects O
, O

were O
placed O
in O
the O
haberdashery O
department O
, O
tools O
were O
made O
available O
to O
the O
tool O
distribution O
center O
. O

If O
relatives O
or O
acquaintances O
succeeded O
in O
rescuing O
items O
of O
luggage O
intact O
, O
this O
was O
a O
major O
hit O
and O
the O
owners O
were O
always O
grateful O
for O
this O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
people O
were O
employed O
in O
the O
dressing O
room O
who O
sorted O
the O
individual O
departments O
and O
were O
searched O
every O
day O
after O
work O
by O
the O
gendarmerie O
and O
Kripo B-ORG
to O
see O
whether O
they O
had O
hidden O
items O
from O
them O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
, O
arrests O
and O
staff O
changes O
. O

Half O
a O
year O
later O
, O
the O
SS O
gave O
orders O
that O
all O
non- O
Jewish O
residents O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
/ O
that O
is O
, O
the O
civilian O
population O
/ O
of O
the O
city O
must O
evacuate O
; O
this O
evacuation O
was O
carried O
out O
within O
a O
month O
and O
the O
whole O
city O
was O
now O
handed O
over O
to O
Jewish O
self O
- O
government O
, O
as O
the O
number O
of O
ghetto O
inmates O
had O
increased O
enormously O
due O
to O
the O
large O
contribution O
of O
further O
transports O
and O
they O
were O
now O
also O
housed O
in O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
city O
. O

With O
this O
, O
the O
exit O
ban O
for O
the O
barracks O
fell O
and O
we O
were O
now O
free O
to O
move O
around O
the O
city O
, O
of O
course O
only O
until O
curfew O
, O
which O
differed O
in O
the O
individual O
seasons O
, O
first O
until O
6 O
, O
later O
until O
8 O
and O
in O
summer O
until O
9 O
and O
even O
until O
10 O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

At O
10 O
o'clock O
all O
light O
had O
to O
be O
turned O
off O
. O

The O
barracks O
were O
now O
guarded O
by O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

Inmates O
who O
were O
able O
to O
leave O
the O
barracks O
or O
who O
came O
home O
after O
curfew O
were O
checked O
by O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
for O
their O
pass O
. O

About O
two O
months O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
first O
Jewish O
people O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
we O
were O
hit O
by O
a O
hard O
blow O
. O

We O
had O
all O
thought O
that O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
would O
be O
a O
permanent O
stay O
for O
us O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
we O
were O
taught O
better O
. O

The O
Nazis O
suddenly O
ordered O
that O
transports O
to O
Poland B-LOC
had O
to O
leave O
. O

There O
was O
again O
a O
lot O
of O
misery O
and O
suffering O
, O
hard O
work O
with O
the O
luggage O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
which O
was O
then O
left O
behind O
and O
sorted O
out O
in O
the O
dressing O
room O
. O

Many O
relatives O
who O
had O
just O
met O
in O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

were O
again O
torn O
apart O
, O
parents O
from O
children O
, O
brothers O
from O
sisters O
, O
etc O
. O

Only O
married O
couples O
with O
underage O
children O
stayed O
together O
. O

We O
as O
members O
of O
the O
Ak O
- O
Transport O
were O
protected O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
we O
had O
contributed O
most O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
ghetto O
. O

The O
number O
of O
Gh B-GHETTO
. I-GHETTO

inmates O
fluctuated O
colossally O
, O
at O
first O
it O
grew O
to O
7,000 O
, O
then O
fell O
again O
to O
5,000 O
, O
then O
rose O
again O
to O
over O
60,000 O
despite O
simultaneous O
outgoing O
transports O
in O
July B-DATE
- O
August B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
to O
over O
60,000 O
and O
then O
slowly O
fell O
again O
. O

The O
first O
transports O
that O
left O
Th B-GHETTO
. I-GHETTO

, O
were O
unofficially O
rumored O
to O
be O
going O
to O
Riga B-GHETTO
/later O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
correct./ O
Further O
transports O
went O
to O
Lodz B-GHETTO
, O
and O
more O
allegedly O
to O
Izbica B-GHETTO
by O
Lublin B-GHETTO
, O
others O
to O
Minsk B-GHETTO
, O
but O
we O
could O
never O
find O
out O
anything O
more O
precise O
. O

My O
own O
later O
experiences O
led O
one O
to O
speculate O
with O
a O
fair O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
these O
people O
perished O
in O
the O
Polish B-LOC
ghettos O
or O
later O
in O
exterminationconcentration O
camps O
. O

We O
always O
observed O
that O
the O
SS O
treated O
people O
ruthlessly O
in O
order O
to O
clear O
the O
transports O
on O
time O
and O
that O
large O
amounts O
of O
luggage O
were O
always O
left O
behind O
. O

When O
4 O
transports O
of O
2,000 O
old O
people O
had O
to O
leave O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
1942 B-DATE
, O
60 O
of O
them O
were O
crammed O
into O
a O
truck O
, O
one O
on O
top O
of O
the O
other O
, O
and O
thus O
brought O
to O
the O
train O
station O
, O
where O
they O
were O
again O
crammed O
tightly O
into O
cattle O
cars O
. O

The O
work O
of O
stuffing O
into O
the O
trucks O
and O
wagons O
was O
done O
by O
the O
ingloriously O
well O
- O
known O
executioner O
Fischer B-PERS
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
nurse O
Rene B-PERS
Jellinek I-PERS
, O
both O
of O
whom O
were O
so O
ruthless O
and O
brutal O
that O
they O
were O
extremely O
favored O
by O
the O
SS O
- O
Nazis O

, O
Bergel B-PERS

Klausen B-PERS

Rene B-PERS
Jellinek I-PERS
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
Hauptscharführer O
Otto B-PERS
and O
the O
driver O
Poljak B-PERS
, O
Otto B-PERS
Later O
on O
, O
the O
Kripo B-ORG
officer O
Susa B-PERS
Braun I-PERS
and O
other O
people O
were O
also O
involved./I O
myself O
saw O
lower O
SS O
charges O
like O
the O
driver O
Poljak B-PERS
brutally O
beat O
old O
people O
who O
could O
not O
sit O
in O
the O
truck O
from O
the O
outside O
with O
blows O
of O
the O
cane O
so O
that O
they O
fell O
over O
their O
fellow O
sufferers O
in O
the O
truck O
. O

I O
also O
saw O
SS O
- O
Hauptscharführer O
Klausen B-PERS
Claussen O
in O
the O
Aussiger B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
with O
old O
men O
and O
women O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
part O
with O
at O
least O
their O
smallest O
piece O
of O
luggage O
when O
getting O
into O
the O
trucks O
, O
tear O
this O
rucksack O
or O
bag O
from O
their O
hand O
and O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
so O
that O
these O
transports O
of O
old O
people O
had O
almost O
nothing O
with O
them O
. O

He O
also O
kicked O
them O
in O
the O
buttocks O
so O
that O
they O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

At O
that O
time O
I O
was O
horrified O
by O
the O
brutality O
of O
taking O
everything O
away O
from O
people O
, O
today O
I O
know O
that O
the O
SS O
led O
these O
old O
people O
to O
their O
immediate O
extermination O
on O
arrival O
in O
an O
extermination O
concentration O
camp O
and O
therefore O
thought O
whether O
the O
people O
were O
already O
losing O
everything O
here O
or O
at O
the O
place O
of O
arrival O
did O
not O
matter O
, O
they O
did O
not O
need O

, O
because O
they O
either O
died O
on O
the O
long O
journey O
/3 O
- O
4 O
days O
of O
exhausting O
driving/ O
or O
immediately O
after O
arriving O

Other O
people O
who O
had O
either O
made O
themselves O
unpopular O
with O
the O
Jewish O
authorities O
or O
the O
imprisoned O
bad O
guys O
were O
also O
placed O
on O
such O
transports O
. O

Very O
often O
sick O
people O
were O
taken O
away O
with O
them O
, O
once O
even O
around O
1000 O
insane O
people O
. O

Bringing O
these O
old O
and O
sick O
people O
together O
, O
most O
of O
whom O
lay O
in O
some O
attic O
, O
was O
already O
torture O
. O

They O
were O
often O
literally O
lying O
in O
their O
own O
droppings O
, O
dressed O
in O
stinking O
clothes O
, O
lying O
one O
on O
top O
of O
the O
other O
in O
the O
dark O
or O
on O
the O
cold O
tiles O
of O
the O
attic O
and O
us O
they O
had O
to O
be O
driven O
to O
the O
schleusse O
barracks O
on O
the O
only O
wagons O
available O
to O
us O
, O
namely O
old O
Jewish O
funeral O
cars O
. O

Many O
were O
already O
dying O
and O
were O
loaded O
while O
already O
dead O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
spare O
other O
living O
people O
. O

When O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
unprotected O
Jews O
from O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Brno B-LOC
had O
been O
ghettoized B-GHETTO
, O
the O
other O
districts O
of O
the O
Protectorate O
had O
their O
turn O
, O
such O
as O
Pilsen B-LOC
, O
Budweis B-LOC
, O
Kladno B-LOC
, O
Königgrätz B-LOC
, O
Pardubice B-LOC
, O
Iglau B-LOC

so O
on O

and O
in O

those O
came O

Munich B-LOC
, O
Kassel B-LOC

and O
later O
from O
Holland B-LOC

Denmark B-LOC
arrived O
. O

These O
were O
a O
bunch O
of O
older O
people O
who O
were O
previously O
housed O
in O
old O
people O
's O
homes O
, O
while O
their O
younger O
family O
members O
were O
transported O
directly O
to O
Poland B-LOC

These O
old O
and O
sick O
Reich O
Germans O
arrived O
in O
Th B-GHETTO
. I-GHETTO

in O
a O
desperate O
state O
, O
with O
little O
luggage O
, O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
from O
the O
journey O
/pressed O
together O
in O
cattle O
wagons O
/ O
, O
mostly O
in O
clothes O
stinking O
with O
feces O
and O
urine O
, O
as O
they O
had O
not O
been O
let O
out O
of O
the O
wagons O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
days O
, O
and O
mostly O
lousy O
. O

The O
louse O
situation O
became O
so O
out O
of O
hand O
that O
the O
medical O
personnel O
were O
no O
longer O
sufficient O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
delousing O
and O
a O
special O
lice O
station O
was O
set O
up O
in O
the O
Jäger B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
a O
long O
, O
low O
building O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
seriously O
lousy O
old O
sick O
people O
still O
had O
a O
chance O
at O
survival O
, O
they O
were O
bathed O
there O
several O
times O
and O
changed O
into O
fresh O
towels O
and O
bedclothes O
. O

/However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
also O
suffered O
from O
dysentery O
or O
at O
least O
enteritis O
and O
the O
beds O
were O
usually O
terribly O
soiled O
again/. O
As O
far O
as O
the O
people O
showed O
little O
life O
energy O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
no O
longer O
deloused O
and O
I O
saw O
a O
large O
number O
of O
dead O
people O
being O
carried O
away O
from O
this O
house O
of O
misery O
every O
day O
, O
covered O
over O
and O
over O
with O
lice O
that O
just O
left O
the O
dead O
body O
in O
large O
numbers O
. O

These O
people O
's O
blankets O
and O
pillows O
were O
burned O
. O

For O
the O
sake O
of O
interest O
, O
when O
I O
was O
carrying O
out O
the O
ambulance O
service O
for O
the O
deloused O
people O
, O
I O
counted O
about O
3000 O
living O
teeming O
lice O
on O
a O
red O
pillow O
40x40 O
cm O
. O

However O
, O
the O
combined O
efforts O
of O
the O
doctors O
and O
the O
nursing O
staff O
succeeded O
in O
mastering O
the O
lice O
and O
the O
associated O
typhus O
danger O
. O

The O
increasing O
density O
of O
the O
ghetto O
population O
turned O
the O
housing O
issue O
into O
a O
burning O
acute O
problem O
. O

The O
SS O
ordered O
that O
wooden O
beds O
with O
3 O
floors O
be O
placed O
in O
all O
available O
rooms O
, O
with O
2 O
floors O
in O
lower O
rooms O
. O

In O
the O
so O
- O
called O
building O
yard O
, O
where O
the O
old O
workshops O
with O
old O
tools O
and O
machines O
were O
put O
back O
into O
operation O
at O
the O
behest O
of O
the O
SS O
and O
where O
there O
was O
a O
forge O
, O
locksmiths O
, O
plumbing O
, O
wagons O
, O
wagons O
, O
carpenters O
, O
painters O
, O
glaziers O
etc O
. O

The O
craftsmen O
had O
it O
pretty O
good O
, O
since O
everyone O
worked O
on O
their O
own O
specialty O
and O
ate O
more O
food O
and O
also O
earned O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
or O
cigarettes O
by O
doing O
various O
unauthorized O
private O
work O
. O

A O
large O
carpentry O
shop O
was O
in O
this O
building O
yard O
, O
which O
was O
entrusted O
with O
the O
construction O
of O
beds O
and O
whose O
capacity O
was O
greatly O
increased O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
huge O
amounts O
of O
wood O
were O
brought O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
via O
Bauschowitz B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
later O
not O
only O
beds O
, O
but O
also O
chairs O
, O
benches O
, O
tables O
and O
wardrobes O
for O
the O
wealthy O
and O
prominent O
were O
made O
, O
including O
reversible O
boards O
for O
the O
women O
's O
barracks O
so O
that O
women O
could O
store O
their O
small O
items O
on O
them O
. O

The O
women O
's O
rooms O
always O
looked O
nicer O
as O
they O
attached O
colorful O
cloths O
, O
blankets O
, O
throws O
, O
etc O
. O

to O
the O
walls O
and O
boards O
and O
gave O
the O
rooms O
a O
warm O
impression O
. O

With O
the O
large O
number O
of O
old O
and O
sick O
people O
, O
it O
was O
very O
natural O
that O
the O
need O
for O
doctors O
and O
nurses O
was O
very O
great O
and O
the O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
work O
of O
these O
people O
was O
one O
of O
the O
brightest O
points O
in O
the O
ghetto O
. O

If O
it O
has O
to O
be O
said O
that O
some O
doctors O
and O
nurses O
treated O
their O
patients O
somewhat O
harshly O
, O
it O
may O
have O
been O
due O
to O
impatience O
and O
overwork O
. O

The O
hospital O
staff O
were O
relatively O
well O
- O
supplied O
with O
food O
, O
as O
they O
also O
had O
food O
for O
the O
sick O
and O
a O
large O
number O
of O
these O
patients O
were O
unable O
to O
eat O
and O
as O
a O
result O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
was O
left O
over O
, O
which O
the O
nursing O
staff O
divided O
up O
. O

In O
the O
Hohenelber B-LOC
barracks O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hospital O
block O
, O
first O
- O
class O
outpatient O
clinics O
with O
good O
instruments O
, O
operating O
theaters O
and O
apparatus O
were O
set O
up O
, O
and O
bacteriological O
test O
cases O
were O
sent O
out O
. O

There O
were O
also O
a O
fair O
number O
of O
good O
x O
- O
ray O
machines O
from O
the O
private O
practices O
of O
the O
doctors O
in O
question O
. O

The O
Nazis O
also O
made O
personal O
use O
of O
the O
doctors O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
visited O
the O
facilities O
and O
were O
cured O
. O

/ O
Sturmbannführer O
Bergel B-PERS
regularly O
visited O
Lecturer O
Stein B-PERS
at O
the O
eye O
clinic O
, O
a O
few O
times O
secret O
births O
or O
abortions O
were O
carried O
out O
for O
Nazi O
women O
under O
orders O
in O
Jewish O
clinics/. O
One O
day O
in O
April B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
the O
order O
came O
that O
1,000 O
women O
were O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
Pürglitzer B-LOC
forests O
to O
work O
in O
the O
woods O
. O

This O
aroused O
mixed O
feelings O
, O
many O
single O
women O
pushed O
for O
it O
, O
believing O
that O
such O
a O
healthy O
workplace O
outside O
of O
the O
ghetto O
would O
be O
good O
for O
them O
, O
while O
others O
feared O
a O
renewed O
separation O
from O
their O
husbands O
or O
other O
relatives O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
a O
speech O
by O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
who O
had O
news O
from O
the O
SS O
, O
tipped O
the O
scales O
and O
said O
that O
no O
woman O
had O
to O
be O
afraid O
; O
that O
the O
work O
consisted O
of O
reforestation O
or O
planting O
of O
young O
trees O
in O
the O
burned O
- O
out O
Pürglitz B-LOC
forest O
district O
, O
the O
accommodation O
was O
in O
groups O
in O
village O
inns O
, O
the O
security O
only O
foresters O
, O
the O
food O
was O
good O
and O
plentiful O
, O
fresh O
air O
, O
the O
prospect O
of O
writing O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
so O
that O
the O
women O
finally O
found O
themselves O
there O
with O
a O
lighter O
heart O
. O

My O
wife O
Manicka B-PERS
also O
went O
with O
them O
and O
she O
did O
well O
, O
the O
stay O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
and O
beautiful O
surroundings O
had O
done O
her O
quite O
good O
, O
she O
came O
back O
really O
rested O
and O
said O
this O
would O
have O
been O
one O
of O
the O
best O
summer O
stays O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
were O
extremely O
worried O
about O
her O
for O
the O
entire O
2 O
months O
. O

I O
still O
remember O
the O
beautiful O
sunny O
day O
when O
the O
women O
came O
back O
from O
the O
Bauschowitz B-LOC
train O
station O
, O
each O
with O
a O
large O
bouquet O
of O
wildflowers O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
radiant O
faces O
, O
tanned O
and O
of O
course O
we O
just O
flew O
into O
each O
other O
's O
arms O
after O
this O
time O
of O
separation O
. O

From O
there O
she O
had O
also O
written O
to O
Prague B-LOC
and O
had O
often O
received O
replies O
and O
parcels O
from O
relatives O
too O
, O
as O
well O
as O
K O
5000.- O
from O
my O
former O
boss O
on O
account O
of O
my O
credit O
with O
him O
, O
yes O
, O
her O
cousin O
Karl O
even O
came O
to O
visit O
her O
and O
talked O
to O
her O
there O
in O
the O
forest O
and O
brought O
food O
in O
his O
suitcase O
. O

Some O
smaller O
male O
labor O
transports O
had O
also O
left O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
300 O
men O
to O
Kladno B-LOC
, O
100 O
to O
Oslavan B-LOC
and O
then O
more O
to O
Kladno B-LOC
. O

They O
all O
had O
it O
pretty O
well O
made O
and O
were O
given O
all O
the O
necessary O
support O
from O
the O
non O
- O
Jewish O
workers O
they O
came O
into O
contact O
with O
on O
these O
detachments O
/ O
food O
, O
money O
, O
cigarettes O
, O
etc./ O
They O
also O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
write O
home O
secretly O
. O

After O
her O
return O
my O
wife O
moved O
with O
others O
in O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
women O
's O
barracks O
, O
which O
like O
the O
Dresden B-LOC
was O
now O
transformed O
into O
an O
old O
people O
’s O
home O
. O

She O
came O
into O
a O
large O
attic O
with O
24 O
companions O
, O
where O
it O
was O
a O
little O
cold O
, O
but O
where O
there O
were O
lots O
of O
capable O
women O
, O
there O
was O
always O
cooking O
and O
people O
tried O
to O
be O
funny O
. O

There O
were O
now O
also O
official O
amusements O
under O
the O
name O
of O
Freizeitgestaltung O
, O
free O
time O
activities O
, O
and O
tolerated O
by O
the O
SS O
, O
music O
and O
even O
dance O
with O
a O
jazz O
band O
, O
lectures O
of O
a O
scientific O
, O
fiction O
and O
biographical O
nature O
, O
revues O
based O
on O
Voskovec O
and O
Werich O
and O
the O
like O
. O

The O
like O
. O

Well O
- O
known O
comedians O
and O
virtuosos O
performed O
and O
even O
some O
operas O
and O
plays O
were O
performed O
, O
which O
became O
a O
lasting O
introduction O
. O

All O
leisure O
evenings O
were O
always O
full O
. O

The O
Hundertschaften O
were O
used O
for O
all O
kinds O
of O
work O
, O
such O
as O
sewerage O
, O
garbage O
disposal O
, O
unloading O
potatoes O
and O
coal O
, O
moving O
machines O
and O
furniture O
, O
and O
leveling O
work O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1942 B-DATE
, O
the O
swim O
school O
had O
to O
be O
prepared O
for O
the O
SS O
. O

The O
sports O
fields O
were O
repaired O
, O
wells O
were O
drilled O
, O
pipes O
were O
dug O
, O
graves O
were O
dug O
up O
, O
the O
crematorium O
was O
built O
, O
and O
we O
were O
often O
sent O
to O
the O
small O
fortress O
to O
do O
field O
and O
gardening O
work O
there O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
SS O
, O
whereby O
the O
notorious O
Alfred B-PERS
and O
yet O
another O
SS O
man O
slapped O
the O
ears O
terribly O
and O
beat O
them O
bloody O
with O
a O
club O
. O

Often O
we O
were O
also O
sent O
to O
the O
farm O
building O
behind O
the O
town O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
large O
barn O
, O
and O
there O
we O
stacked O
heavy O
peat O
and O
hay O
bales O
up O
to O
a O
height O
of O
20 O
meters O
. O

An O
administrator O
named O
Brichta B-PERS
, O
who O
supervised O
us O
, O
was O
also O
guilty O
of O
inhuman O
behavior O
. O

One O
day O
a O
particularly O
large O
work O
force O
of O
several O
hundred O
men O
was O
formed O
and O
started O
building O
a O
branch O
line O
from O
the O
Bauschowitz B-LOC
train O
station O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
SS O
. O

We O
thought O
that O
the O
war O
would O
be O
over O
before O
this O
was O
finished O
, O
but O
the O
railway O
, O
which O
made O
a O
wide O
bend O
, O
was O
finished O
within O
a O
few O
months O
and O
the O
trains O
now O
drove O
to O
Th B-GHETTO
. I-GHETTO

, O
where O
the O
tracks O
branched O
, O
one O
behind O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks O
, O
and O
the O
other O
ended O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Jäger B-LOC
barracks O
. O

Now O
material O
and O
people O
transports O
could O
be O
loaded O
into O
the O
city O
, O
which O
at O
least O
spared O
the O
people O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
stress O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
an O
intensification O
of O
the O
transports O
was O
the O
result O
, O
because O
in O
the O
past O
1000 O
people O
had O
always O
come O
or O
gone O
, O
whereas O
now O
within O
10 O
days O
/ O
in O
3-day O
intervals O
7500 O
people O
were O
away O
at O
once O
. O

Already O
in O
winter O
the O
close O
coexistence O
in O
the O
houses O
and O
barracks O
had O
revealed O
a O
large O
number O
of O
vermin O
, O
mainly O
fleas O
and O
bedbugs O
, O
the O
fleas O
became O
a O
real O
nuisance O
in O
summer O
, O
one O
often O
did O
not O
sleep O
at O
all O
all O
night O
and O
scratched O
oneself O
incessantly O
. O

I O
sometimes O
caught O
30 O
- O
50 O
fleas O
in O
one O
night O
and O
all O
of O
the O
sheets O
were O
covered O
with O
the O
bloody O
excrement O
of O
the O
fleas O
. O

The O
wooden O
beds O
and O
the O
boards O
behind O
them O
housed O
entire O
breeding O
grounds O
for O
bedbugs O
and O
we O
were O
completely O
powerless O
against O
it O
. O

Burning O
out O
and O
dismantling O
the O
beds O
did O
not O
help O
. O

When O
the O
management O
intervened O
, O
the O
Nazis O
finally O
sent O
disinfectants O
and O
the O
barracks O
and O
blocks O
were O
subjected O
to O
a O
thorough O
disinfection O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
which O
although O
it O
never O
completely O
eradicated O
the O
vermin O
, O
as O
the O
same O
was O
always O
brought O
in O
again O
, O
at O
least O
brought O
a O
great O
relief O
. O

All O
the O
inmates O
of O
a O
block O
or O
part O
of O
the O
barracks O
were O
evacuated O
for O
4 O
- O
5 O
days O
, O
all O
doors O
and O
windows O
and O
other O
openings O
were O
carefully O
glued O
over O
with O
paper O
, O
and O
cyclone O
or O
vontox O
gas O
was O
let O
in O
, O
which O
went O
through O
all O
clothes O
, O
suitcases O
and O
beds O
, O
killing O
all O
vermin O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
the O
inmates O
came O
back O
, O
everything O
was O
opened O
, O
aired O
and O
we O
had O
a O
few O
weeks O
of O
rest O
until O
new O
vermin O
were O
brought O
in O
from O
elsewhere O
. O

With O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
ghetto O
population O
due O
to O
continuously O
arriving O
transports O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
Reich O
and O
Austria B-LOC
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
departure O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
so O
- O
called O
Protectorate O
members O
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
the O
Reich O
German O
inmates O
had O
become O
numerically O
overrepresented O

demanded O
that O
this O
also O
be O
expressed O
in O
the O
leadership O
as O
well O
as O
in O
all O
offices O

In O
the O

in O

only O
German B-LOC

As O
Jewish O
elder O
, O
Dr O

Paul O
Israel O
Eppstein O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
was O
appointed O
and O
the O
former O
Jewish O

Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
became O
his O

Another O
position O
in O
the O
Council O

was O
given O
to O
the O
disreputable O
Dr O

Murmelstein B-PERS
from O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

Edelstein O
was O
later O
accused O
by O
the O
SS O
of O
not O
keeping O
things O
in O
order O
because O
some O
people O
had O
run O
away O
and O
this O
incident O
had O
been O
covered O
up O
and O
concealed O
by O
the O
evidence O
management O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
was O
locked O
up O
and O
sent O
away O
on O
a O
later O
transport O
. O

The O
same O
fate O
befell O
Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
, O
because O
in O
October B-DATE
, O
when O
it O
was O
announced O
in O
October B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
that O
the O
new O
transports O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
were O
going O
to O
be O
exterminated O
and O
he O
was O
told O
to O
keep O
silent O
about O
it O
, O
to O
which O
he O
did O
not O
agree O
, O
he O
was O
locked O
up O
and O
nobody O
heard O
from O
him O
anymore O
, O
whereupon O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
took O
over O
the O
management O
, O
whose O
mentality O
did O
not O
impose O
any O
mental O
inhibitions O
on O
him O
when O
he O
kept O
silent O
about O
the O
transport O
regulations O
. O

All O
handicraft O
businesses O
were O
grouped O
together O
in O
a O
special O
department O
called O
Production O
, O
which O
meant O
both O
production O
for O
the O
consumption O
of O
the O
ghetto O
inmates O
and O
for O
purposes O
. O

The O
cabinet O
- O
making O
department O
set O
up O
entire O
rooms O
in O
the O
SS O
headquarters O
and O
the O
comradeship O
home O
, O
and O
first O
- O
class O
Jewish O
artists O
were O
entrusted O
with O
decorating O
the O
interior O
. O

Some O
establishments O
served O
directly O
for O
commercial O
sales O
purposes O
, O
e.g O
. O

the O
workshops O
H. B-PERS
Lautsch I-PERS
, O
which O
were O
set O
up O
in O
a O
command O
center O
building O
. O

There O
, O
lampshades O
, O

, O
congratulation O

paintings O
, O
as O
well O
as O
associated O
frames O
, O
sculptures O
, O
pottery O
and O
ceramic O
work O
, O
were O
completed O
, O
dispatched O
and O
paid O
for O
, O
which O
was O
very O
good O
for O
the O
ghetto O
. O

A O
large O
workshop O
for O
mica O
columns O
was O
set O
up O
. O

/The O
mica O
came O
to O
Th B-GHETTO
. I-GHETTO

in O
large O
pieces O
in O
boxes O
and O
was O
split O
into O
thin O
plates O
by O
the O
hand O
of O
women O
, O
packed O
and O
sent O
back O
. O

These O
mica O
plates O
are O
used O
in O
the O
electrical O
industry O
for O
insulation O
purposes./ O
A O
large O
cardboard O
workshop O
and O
a O
small O
factory O
for O
children O
's O
building O
toys O
and O
picture O
books O
were O
built O
which O
also O
employed O
many O
men O
and O
women O
. O

In O
a O
leather O
goods O
workshop O
, O
purses O
, O
wallets O
, O
tobacco O
, O
neck O
pouches O
, O
etc O
. O

were O
made O
in O
large O
quantities O
from O
synthetic O
material O
. O

Finally O
one O
day O
a O
large O
war O
production O
workshop O
was O
set O
up O
on O
the O
large O
market O
place O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
K O
- O
/boxes/ O
production O
. O

3 O
huge O
tents O
, O
each O
100 O
m O
long O
, O
were O
set O
up O
on O
iron O
scaffolding O
, O
infinite O
quantities O
of O
special O
boards O
came O
in O
, O
from O
which O
boxes O
of O
a O
standard O
size O
were O
put O
together O
, O
and O
various O
small O
components O
that O
arrived O
were O
put O
together O
and O
packed O
into O
the O
boxes O
. O

These O
were O
devices O
to O
prevent O
the O
freezing O
of O
motor O
truck O
engines O
. O

This O
production O
lasted O
through O
the O
winter O
of O
1943 B-DATE
and O
through O
that O
time O
, O
1,000,000 O
boxes O
were O
filled O
. O

Then O
the O
tents O
were O
broken O
down O
again O
and O
the O
market O
place O
was O
cleared O
. O

Since O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
food O
, O
as O
well O
as O
cigarettes O
were O
bagged O
in O
the O
Lautsch B-PERS
workshops O
, O
and O
even O
Germans B-LOC
were O
involved O
, O
one O
day O
most O
of O
the O
workshops O
were O
closed O
. O

Only O
the O
jewelry O
department O
remained O
. O

All O
the O
land O
around O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
as O
well O
as O
on O
and O
between O
the O
ramparts O
, O
which O
are O
known O
to O
be O
arranged O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
12-pointed O
star O
, O
were O
built O
on O
and O
a O
special O
agricultural O
department O
had O
the O
task O
of O
sowing O
, O
mowing O
, O
planting O
, O
watering O
, O
clearing O
and O
fertilizing O
. O

This O
group O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
- O
a O
large O
number O
of O
men O
and O
women O
were O
busy O
doing O
it O
- O
but O
it O
was O
healthy O
work O
and O
profitable O
in O
that O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
eat O
whatever O
they O
could O
eat O
on O
the O
spot O
from O
the O
harvested O
field O
and O
garden O
crops O
. O

Naturally O
, O
the O
proceeds O
were O
intended O
for O
SS O
purposes O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
everyone O
tried O
to O
bring O
a O
lot O
home O
, O
which O
most O
of O
them O
also O
managed O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
gendarmes O
, O
who O
turned O
a O
blind O
eye O
, O
or O
had O
to O
be O
very O
cleverly O
hidden O
. O

Greens O
, O
potatoes O
, O
fruit O
, O
tomatoes O
, O
swede O
, O
carrots O
came O
into O
the O
ghetto O
in O
this O
way O
, O
albeit O
only O
in O
small O
quantities O
. O

Often O
people O
were O
caught O
and O
when O
the O
Nazi O
authorities O
found O
out O
, O
they O
were O
locked O
up O
and O
then O
the O
next O
transport O
to O
the O
east O
threatened O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
farming O
people O
were O
allowed O
to O
create O
small O
gardens O
themselves O
between O
the O
entrenchments O
, O
wherever O
there O
was O
a O
green O
spot O
on O
the O
periphery O
of O
the O
ghetto O
. O

This O
was O
then O
extended O
to O
the O
prominent O
people O
, O
so O
that O
every O
higher O
- O
ranking O
official O
or O
workshop O
manager O
etc O
. O

had O
a O
garden O
. O

Mainly O
potatoes O
, O
swede O
, O
cauliflower O
, O
carrots O
, O
etc O
. O

were O
planted O
. O

Ordinary O
mortals O
, O
of O
course O
, O
could O
not O
acquire O
a O
garden O
and O
, O
as O
in O
everything O
else O
, O
were O
dependent O
on O
their O
hunger O
pangs O
. O

A O
chapter O
in O
itself O
was O
the O
kitchen O
and O
provisions O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
bakery O
, O
all O
of O
which O
were O
subordinate O
to O
the O
economic O
department O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
cooks O
in O
the O
kitchen O
took O
as O
much O
food O
as O
they O
wanted O
, O
because O
it O
would O
have O
been O
difficult O
to O
prevent O
them O
. O

The O
kitchen O
staff O
always O
stole O
large O
amounts O
of O
food O
from O
the O
kitchen O
for O
relatives O
and O
friends O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ingredients O
such O
as O
margarine O
, O
sugar O
, O
meat O
, O
flour O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
which O
of O
course O
meant O
that O
the O
food O
of O
the O
whole O
population O
was O
poorer O
. O

The O
soups O
for O
example O
had O
no O
fat O
at O
all O
, O
as O
the O
little O
margarine O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
put O
in O
by O
the O
cooks O
didn't O
seem O
to O
be O
put O
in O
there O
. O

/ O
Nobody O
would O
have O
noticed O
anyway O
whether O
that O
little O
bit O
was O
in O
it O
or O
not O
/. O
If O
you O
consider O
that O
in O
the O
5 O
- O
6 O
large O
kitchens O
at O
least O
30 O
- O
50 O
, O
later O
even O
up O
to O
100 O
men O
and O
women O
worked O
in O
shifts O
, O
including O
the O
ration O
service O
who O
cut O
the O
relevant O
day O
coupons O
off O
the O
ration O
cards O
when O
the O
food O
was O
distributed O
in O
front O
of O
the O
kitchen O
, O
plus O
the O
kitchen O
control O
commission O
, O
which O
had O
to O
determine O
in O
the O
kitchen O
itself O
whether O
the O
raw O
products O
made O
available O
were O
actually O
put O
into O
the O
food O
, O
plus O
the O
kitchen O
guard O
, O
who O
had O
to O
take O
care O
that O
no O
food O
was O
carried O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
Kripo B-ORG
had O
to O
solve O
the O
particular O
thefts O
and O
the O
later O
- O
created O
economic O
police O
/Wipo/ O
who O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
special O
economic O
matters O
, O
which O
is O
to O
say O
they O
let O
dear O
God O
be O
a O
good O
man O
and O
ate O
and O
stole O
bravely O
, O
so O
one O
can O
imagine O
how O
it O
was O
with O
the O
food O
for O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
any O
such O
benefits O
. O

The O
same O
conditions O
prevailed O
everywhere O
in O
the O
provisions O
, O
the O
bakery O
, O
the O
portioning O
station O
and O
in O
the O
material O
store O
and O
so O
one O
should O
not O
be O
surprised O
if O
these O
people O
sitting O
at O
the O
crib O
not O
only O
ate O
well O
but O
were O
also O
able O
to O
barter O
everything O
else O
. O

Soon O
the O
cooks O
and O
food O
supervisors O
set O
up O
special O
apartments O
where O
they O
lived O
together O
with O
their O
families O
or O
relatives O
and O
a O
private O
life O
was O
made O
possible O
, O
the O
rooms O
could O
be O
better O
equipped O
and O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
same O
saw O
things O
they O
would O
never O
see O
served O
on O
the O
plates O
or O
in O
the O
stores O
. O

This O
brings O
me O
to O
another O
chapter O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Raumwirtschaft O
or O
Ubikationskanzlei O
/bosses O
were O
Messrs O
. O

Löwinger B-PERS
and O
Rindler B-PERS
/. O
This O
office O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
room O
allocation O
for O
the O
ghetto O
inmates O
. O

In O
the O
early O
days O
, O
when O
only O
the O
barracks O
were O
inhabited O
, O
each O
was O
entitled O
to O
about O
2.10 O
cm2 O
, O
which O
roughly O
corresponded O
to O
the O
area O
of O
​​a O
bed O
plus O
a O
shelf O
behind O
the O
head O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
and O
the O
staff O
lived O
much O
better O
with O
their O
relatives O
and O
had O
smaller O
rooms O
of O
6 O
- O
20 O
cm2 O
for O
the O
family O
, O
where O
they O
soon O
furnished O
themselves O
architecturally O
with O
older O
furniture O
or O
new O
furniture O
made O
to O
order O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Soon O
the O
various O
workshop O
managers O
, O
kitchens O
- O
etc O
. O

, O
provisioning O
staff O
, O
higher O
officials O
, O
etc O
. O

moved O
with O
the O
permission O
of O
the O
Ubikationskanzlei O
with O
their O
families O
, O
because O
rooms O
were O
vacated O
by O
evacuation O
and O
deaths O
. O

People O
who O
had O
protection O
from O
the O
authorities O
or O
who O
could O
buy O
it O
from O
the O
space O
management O
were O
soon O
assigned O
rooms O
to O
live O
separately O
and O
the O
others O
just O
had O
to O
continue O
to O
live O
in O
a O
cramped O
manner O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
overcrowding O
it O
was O
a O
shame O
to O
look O
at O
the O
old O
people O
, O
to O
whom O
the O
space O
management O
, O
partly O
for O
lack O
of O
protection O
, O
partly O
for O
lack O
of O
space O
, O
did O
not O
allocate O
better O
rooms O
than O
attics O
, O
where O
they O
laid O
in O
the O
greatest O
dirt O
on O
the O
bare O
stone O
, O
in O
the O
summer O
in O
terrible O
heat O
and O
in O
winter O
just O
as O
cold O
. O

Many O
enterprising O
younger O
people O
who O
knew O
something O
about O
work O
and O
also O
had O
some O
uncle O
in O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
or O
room O
management O
were O
given O
free O
building O
material O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
larger O
room O
in O
some O
attic O
, O
where O
they O
then O
broke O
through O
the O
roofs O
and O
built O
nice O
, O
habitable O
attics O
for O
2 O
- O
5 O
. O

It O
was O
very O
comfortable O
here O
, O
almost O
like O
in O
civilian O
life O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
house O
elders O
, O
who O
lived O
in O
1 O
or O
more O
rooms O
with O
their O
families O
, O
also O
led O
a O
comfortable O
life O
. O

Most O
of O
these O
people O
also O
had O
another O
source O
of O
livelihood O
, O
which O
arose O
from O
their O
position O
in O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

Since O
they O
had O
acquired O
this O
position O
through O
relatives O
or O
other O
relationships O
through O
protection O
, O
one O
can O
imagine O
the O
system O
of O
favoritism O
that O
prevailed O
, O
how O
few O
real O
experts O
were O
in O
their O
correct O
positions O
, O
and O
how O
discontent O
among O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
mortals O
grew O
. O

Due O
to O
heavy O
evacuations O
during O
the O
year O
43 B-DATE
, O
the O
population O
was O
reduced O
and O
the O
housing O
conditions O
would O
have O
generally O
improved O
if O
the O
order O
had O
not O
been O
given O
one O
day O
that O
the O
largest O
men O
’ O
s O
barracks O
, O
the O
Sudeten O
barracks O
, O
must O
be O
vacated O
within O
48 O
hours O
, O
as O
the O
SS O
authorities O
intended O
to O
move O
there O
from O
Prague B-LOC
/Probably O
because O
they O
felt O
safest O
there O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
possible O
enemy O
air O
raids/. O
It O
was O
a O
hot O
summer O
day O
at O
the O
time O
and O
when O
the O
order O
to O
evacuate O
was O
given O
, O
there O
was O
indescribable O
chaos O
. O

There O
were O
about O
4800 O
men O
who O
, O
according O
to O
orders O
, O
were O
mostly O
transferred O
to O
unoccupied O
attics O
. O

Only O
individual O
groups O
of O
protected O
children O
were O
able O
to O
obtain O
orders O
to O
move O
to O
small O
rooms O
in O
blocks O
from O
the O
Ubikationskanzlei O
. O

All O
old O
flat O
cars O
and O
funeral O
cars O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
depot O
and O
all O
rucksacks O
, O
suitcases O
, O
bedrolls O
, O
tables O
, O
chairs O
, O
beds O
, O
etc O
. O

loaded O
and O
transported O
to O
the O
new O
residential O
areas O
. O

It O
was O
like O
being O
in O
an O
evacuated O
city O
before O
enemy O
occupation O
. O

One O
helped O
the O
other O
and O
all O
were O
extremely O
exhausted O
from O
the O
hard O
work O
in O
the O
dust O
and O
heat O
that O
evening O
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
an O
attic O
with O
several O
friends O
, O
which O
was O
very O
bad O
and O
we O
decided O
, O
like O
most O
of O
the O
others O
, O
to O
take O
matters O
into O
our O
own O
hands O
and O
build O
an O
attic O
somewhere O
on O
our O
own O
. O

I O
went O
on O
a O
search O
and O
found O
an O
ideal O
place O
in O
a O
former O
city O
administration O
building O
in O
the O
attic O
, O
from O
which O
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
view O
of O
the O
market O
square O
. O

In O
consideration O
of O
the O
exceptional O
situation O
, O
the O
room O
management O
approached O
all O
requests O
in O
this O
regard O
with O
benevolence O
and O
the O
news O
spread O
that O
in O
general O
there O
would O
be O
no O
objections O
to O
converting O
the O
attics O
into O
attics O
and O
that O
this O
would O
be O
tacitly O
approved O
. O

However O
, O
in O
general O
, O
material O
was O
not O
just O
made O
available O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
did O
what O
all O
other O
fellow O
sufferers O
did O
and O
took O
material O
where O
we O
could O
get O
it O
. O

My O
friend O
Paul B-PERS
Dub I-PERS
/by O
civil O
profession O
a O
dental O
technician O
- O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
however O
, O
menage O
service/ O
had O
relationships O
with O
people O
from O
the O
wood O
store O
and O
we O
got O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
wooden O
planks O
, O
strips O
, O
squared O
timber O
, O
ship O
planks O
of O
all O
kinds O
and O
planing O
from O
there O
over O
several O
consecutive O
days O
; O
I O
obtained O
the O
material O
through O
my O
connections O
to O
the O
machine O
joinery O
. O

At O
that O
time O
I O
had O
already O
left O
the O
transport O
hundertschaft O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
worked O
in O
the O
accounting O
department O
of O
the O
production O
department O
, O
in O
which O
position O
I O
had O
free O
access O
to O
all O
production O
facilities O
and O
was O
able O
to O
establish O
many O
relationships O
. O

So O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
me O
to O
use O
a O
lot O
of O
material O
like O
locks O
, O
hinges O
, O
glass O
, O
nail O
screws O
, O
tools O
, O
etc O
. O

Like O
lime O
, O
cement O
, O
sand O
, O
gypsum O
, O
etc O
. O

Heraklite O
slabs O
were O
piled O
up O
in O
large O
quantities O
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
our O
building O
and O
were O
supposed O
to O
be O
used O
to O
expand O
the O
attic O
anyway O
, O
but O
the O
plan O
had O
always O
been O
postponed O
by O
the O
building O
authorities O
. O

I O
started O
now O
with O
Paul B-PERS
Dub I-PERS
and O
a O
second O
colleague O
, O
Andrej B-PERS
Malinovski I-PERS
/from O
civilian O
profession O
fur O
cutter O
- O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
carpenter O
/ O
to O
build O
and O
took O
some O
special O
craftsmen O
, O
such O
as O
glaziers O
, O
window O
carpenters O
, O
upholsterers O
, O
bricklayers O
, O
locksmiths O
to O
help O
. O

We O
paid O
for O
their O
work O
for O
weeks O
with O
our O
stocks O
of O
bread O
, O
jam O
, O
margarine O
, O
canned O
food O
, O
sugar O
, O
ate O
nothing O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
worked O
when O
we O
weren't O
professionally O
employed O
, O
so O
that O
our O
health O
pretty O
much O
deteriorated O
, O
but O
in O
a O
few O
days O
the O
roof O
was O
broken O
through O
, O
the O
window O
was O
finished O
, O
the O
scaffolding O
of O
the O
16 O
cm2 O
mansard O
was O
erected O
and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
everything O
was O
covered O
with O
Heraklite O
and O
bricked O
up O
, O
painted O
and O
sealed O
and O
3 O
couches O
, O
armchairs O
, O
chest O
of O
drawers O
, O
built O
- O
in O
cupboards O
and O
moved O
in O
with O
us O
. O

From O
that O
time O
on O
we O
led O
a O
somewhat O
private O
life O
with O
our O
friends O
and O
spouses O
. O

We O
also O
had O
electric O
cookers O
, O
immersion O
heaters O
, O
heating O
pads O
, O
irons O
, O
everything O
was O
on O
electric O
and O
in O
her O
free O
time O
my O
wife O
switched O
on O
in O
the O
attic O
like O
at O
home O
and O
she O
cooked O
, O
ironed O
, O
washed O
, O
and O
made O
clothes O
, O
all O
of O
which O
gave O
her O
great O
pleasure O
. O

The O
other O
two O
women O
had O
good O
apartments O
elsewhere O
, O
so O
that O
Manička B-PERS
and O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
attic O
the O
most O
. O

Many O
friends O
came O
to O
visit O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
my O
mother O
was O
now O
our O
daily O
guest O
. O

At O
that O
time O
we O
were O
just O
getting O
several O
parcels O
from O
our O
Prague B-LOC
relatives O
, O
some O
of O
our O
friends O
were O
in O
the O
farm O
, O
others O
in O
the O
bakery O
, O
Dub B-PERS
could O
get O
some O
food O
from O
the O
menage O
service O
every O
now O
and O
then O
and O
that O
's O
how O
we O
lived O
at O
that O
time O
happier O
and O
hoped O
to O
survive O
the O
terrible O
war O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
halfway O
protected O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
1943 B-DATE
, O
large O
furniture O
transports O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
which O
came O
from O
old O
, O
partly O
broken O
furniture O
in O
the O
Jewish O
apartments O
of O
the O
Jews O
deported O
from O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
Moravia B-LOC
. O

Some O
of O
this O
furniture O
was O
badly O
infested O
and O
had O
to O
be O
disinfected O
, O
after O
which O
it O
was O
then O
allocated O
to O
all O
prominent O
people O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
provided O
they O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
private O
apartment O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
furniture O
was O
set O
up O
in O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
, O
some O
in O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks O
on O
the O
courtyards O
, O
much O
of O
it O
was O
taken O
away O
by O
other O
people O
/who O
were O
not O
prominents O
- O
but O
already O
had O
nice O
apartments O
, O
because O
the O
large O
number O
of O
items O
was O
difficult O
to O
to O
guard O
. O

I O
also O
procured O
from O
there O
2 O
wire O
inlays O
for O
our O
couches O
, O
a O
folding O
table O
, O
3 O
upholstered O
armchairs O
, O
1 O
cupboard O
, O
and O
a O
nice O
large O
mirror O
, O
which O
we O
could O
use O
very O
well O
in O
the O
attic O
, O
my O
wife O
was O
particularly O
happy O
with O
the O
mirror O
and O
that O
we O
now O
put O
new O
wardrobe O
in O
conjunction O
with O
the O
other O
closets O
that O
had O
already O
been O
installed O
, O
all O
our O
clothes O
and O
linen O
in O
them O
nicely O
and O
cleanly O
, O
as O
the O
constant O
opening O
and O
closing O
of O
the O
suitcases O
was O
extremely O
uncomfortable O
for O
us O
. O

Major O
changes O
had O
meanwhile O
also O
taken O
place O
in O
the O
ghetto O
. O

Probably O
to O
create O
an O
alibi O
in O
front O
of O
the O
world O
, O
the O
Nazi O
authorities O
ordered O
one O
day O
that O
all O
kinds O
of O
shops O
should O
be O
set O
up O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
within O
a O
week O
. O

We O
should O
be O
very O
lucky O
to O
be O
in O
a O
model O
and O
propaganda O
ghetto O
. O

Men O
’s O
clothing O
, O
women O
’s O
clothing O
, O
men O
’s O
underclothes O
, O
and O
women O
’s O
underclothes O
, O
children O
's O
clothing O
, O
kitchen O
utensils O
, O
paper O
and O
haberdashery O
, O
suitcases O
and O
leather O
goods O
stores O
were O
set O
up O
, O
employees O
were O
put O
in O
and O
the O
goods O
from O
the O
sorted O
out O
contents O
of O
the O
confiscated O
suitcases O
emptied O
in O
the O
clothing O
room O
were O
made O
available O
. O

Selling O
took O
place O
using O
a O
coupon O
, O
there O
were O
coupons O
of O
different O
types O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
articles O
to O
be O
bought O
. O

The O
ghetto O
inmates O
were O
able O
to O
shop O
on O
a O
rotating O
basis O
, O
but O
the O
intervals O
were O
so O
long O
that O
their O
turn O
came O
once O
every O
2 O
- O
3 O
months O
and O
there O
was O
mostly O
nothing O
in O
stock O
or O
only O
the O
greatest O
trash O
, O
as O
things O
were O
sorted O
into O
3 O
categories O
in O
the O
clothing O
room O
and O
only O
the O
third O
quality O
was O
made O
available O
to O
the O
ghetto O
shops O
. O

Most O
of O
it O
was O
unusable O
. O

Payment O
also O
had O
to O
be O
made O
, O
and O
specifically O
for O
this O
purpose O
the O
Nazis O
had O
special O
ghetto O
money O
printed O
in O
the O
Czech B-LOC
National O
Bank O
with O
values O
​​of O
K O
1 O
, O
- O
2 O
, O
- O
5 O
, O
- O
10 O
, O
- O
20 O
, O
- O
50 O
, O
- O
and O
100 O
, O
- O
in O
different O
sizes O
and O
colors O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
same O
motifs O
. O

On O
one O
side O
there O
was O
an O
image O
of O
Moses O
with O
the O
tablets O
of O
the O
law O
/this O
was O
probably O
done O
with O
mocking O
or O
at O
least O
ironic O
intent/ O
and O
on O
the O
other O
side O
was O
next O
to O
the O
usual O
text O
Receipt O
for O
... O
crowns O
, O
the O
number O
and O
the O
signature O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
, O
Jewish O
Elder O
. O

If O
the O
shopkeepers O
in O
question O
got O
better O
things O
from O
the O
clothes O
closet O
, O
they O
didn’t O
put O
them O
up O
for O
sale O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
exchanged O
them O
for O
groceries O
or O
cigarettes O
. O

We O
had O
to O
have O
special O
purchase O
certificates O
for O
complete O
suits O
or O
shoes O
, O
which O
were O
very O
difficult O
to O
obtain O
, O
i.e O
. O

protection O
was O
necessary O
for O
this O
. O

A O
so O
- O
called O
grocery O
store O
was O
also O
opened O
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
real O
groceries O
in O
it O
, O
only O
spices O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
artificial O
pepper O
, O
paprika O
, O
garlic O
powder O
, O
mustard O
, O
tomato O
sauce O
, O
spicy O
spreads O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
saccharine O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
almost O
never O
went O
shopping O
because O
it O
always O
made O
us O
angry O
. O

At O
most O
, O
we O
once O
bought O
a O
few O
colorful O
pillowcases O
to O
decorate O
our O
attic O
. O

A O
special O
bank O
was O
entrusted O
with O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
money O
as O
well O
as O
the O
payment O
of O
the O
working O
ghetto O
inmates O
and O
their O
account O
management O
/ O
so O
that O
they O
could O
also O
save O
/ O
which O
was O
of O
course O
created O
for O
this O
purpose O
and O
which O
proudly O
bore O
the O
name O
Bank O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Self O
- O
Government O
. O

The O
whole O
institute O
was O
of O
course O
just O
a O
farce O
, O
resp O
. O

a O
Potemkin O
village O
like O
everything O
else O
, O
but O
the O
appearance O
was O
kept O
up O
all O
along O
, O
as O
if O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
real O
and O
regular O
. O

Since O
the O
money O
had O
no O
coverage O
whatsoever O
, O
at O
best O
in O
private O
transactions O
it O
had O
the O
value O
of O
game O
tokens O
. O

It O
was O
not O
valid O
outside O
the O
ghetto O
and O
it O
was O
also O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
spend O
this O
money O
outside O
the O
ghetto O
. O

We O
heard O
that O
they O
supposedly O
paid O
relatively O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
outside O
to O
get O
this O
money O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
curiosity O
. O

The O
bank O
was O
the O
building O
in O
which O
I O
lived O
in O
the O
attic O
. O

In O
the O
same O
building O
there O
was O
also O
the O
health O
service O
/ O
Ministry O
of O
Public O
Welfare O
and O
Hygiene O
/ O
as O
well O
as O
the O
finance O
department O
- O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Finance O
and O
the O
Ghetto O
Court O
- O
an O
institution O
set O
up O
by O
the O
Nazis O
, O
which O
had O
to O
try O
all O
major O
offenses O
and O
crimes O
in O
the O
ghetto O
insofar O
as O
the O
Nazis O
were O
interested O
. O

This O
ghetto O
court O
was O
of O
course O
a O
Potemkin O
village O
too O
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
shops O
, O
a O
coffee O
house O
was O
also O
created O
, O
the O
interior O
was O
relatively O
nicely O
furnished O
. O

You O
could O
have O
tea O
or O
coffee O
in O
it O
to O
consume O
, O
table O
games O
were O
forbidden O
, O
you O
couldn't O
smoke O
in O
it O
, O
of O
course O
, O
but O
there O
was O
always O
a O
nice O
music O
program O
in O
the O
afternoons O
and O
evenings O
, O
first O
- O
class O
cabaret O
artists O
, O
jazz O
band O
and O
classical O
music O
, O
singing O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
so O
the O
thing O
was O
always O
full O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
coffee O
house O
provided O
a O
pleasant O
change O
in O
exile O
. O

The O
Jazz O
Singers O
, O
Mayer B-PERS
Meyer O
- O
Sattler B-PERS
, O
Ghettoswingers O
, O
were O
particularly O
popular O
. O

We O
called O
this O
coffeehouse O
the O
largest O
in O
the O
world O
because O
it O
was O
a O
coffeehouse O
for O
30,000 O
people O
. O

Likewise O
, O
as O
part O
of O
the O
propaganda O
for O
the O
modelghetto O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
city O
beautification O
campaign O
was O
ordered O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1944 B-DATE
. O

The O
K O
production O
tent O
had O
just O
been O
demolished O
and O
the O
marketplace O
was O
completely O
empty O
. O

Within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
the O
market O
square O
was O
plowed O
, O
sown O
, O
large O
flower O
beds O
laid O
out O
, O
benches O
set O
up O
everywhere O
, O
/this O
also O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
city/ O
, O
a O
music O
pavilion O
was O
built O
in O
which O
the O
city O
band O
played O
all O
day O
, O
and O
the O
houses O
were O
repainted O
all O
over O
the O
city O
, O
the O
entrenchments O
around O
the O
city O
opened O
as O
a O
promenade O
for O
the O
ghetto O
inmates O
, O
a O
huge O
children O
's O
playground O
made O
available O
on O
the O
large O
slope O
, O
a O
really O
nice O
children O
's O
hospital O
set O
up O
in O
the O
former O
villa O
of O
a O
German O
- O
Aryan O
resident O
of O
the O
city O
, O
who O
moved O
elsewhere O
, O
a O
pavilion O
for O
small O
children O
was O
built O
in O
one O
ghetto O
park O
so O
the O
smallest O
could O
play O
, O
and O
even O
bathing O
facilities O
in O
a O
pool O
, O
and O
a O
community O
building O
with O
a O
theater O
, O
cinema O
and O
reading O
room O
was O
set O
up O
in O
the O
former O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium O
, O
but O
all O
of O
these O
were O
only O
intended O
as O
Potemkin O
villages O
because O
an O
international O
commission B-ORG
was O
coming O
to O
visit O
and O
see O
the O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

However O
, O
for O
all O
the O
time O
before O
the O
Commission B-ORG
came O
we O
took O
advantage O
of O
this O
facility O
, O
though O
we O
always O
had O
the O
uncomfortable O
feeling O
that O
this O
joy O
would O
not O
last O
long O
. O

The O
commission B-ORG
finally O
came O
from O
SS O
- O
Hauptsturmführer O
Rahm B-PERS
/ O
Camp O
Commandant O
/ O
, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
satellites O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
from O
the O
Council O
of O
Elders O
, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
this O
commission B-ORG
was O
not O
really O
an O
international O
control O
organ O
, O
but O
only O
contained O
representatives O
of O
those O
nations O
that O
were O
already O
in O
thrall O
to O
the O
Nazis O
or O
under O
Nazi O
leadership O
, O
such O
as O
Danes B-LOC
and O
the O
like O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
selected O
commissioners B-ORG
apparently O
agreed O
entirely O
with O
Nazi O
policy O
. O

The O
control O
was O
carried O
out O
to O
the O
full O
satisfaction O
of O
all O
involved O
, O
the O
SS O
was O
satisfied O
, O
the O
commission B-ORG
was O
supposedly O
also O
satisfied O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
the O
Jews O
were O
also O
because O
the O
SS O
promised O
certain O
benefits O
considering O
the O
good O
result O
. O

But O
the O
bitter O
end O
would O
still O
follow O
. O

This O
condition O
and O
the O
actual O
beautification O
of O
the O
city O
and O
improvement O
of O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
ghetto O
had O
progressed O
little O
by O
little O
and O
lifted O
our O
general O
mood O
, O
so O
that O
we O
could O
devote O
ourselves O
to O
the O
questions O
of O
daily O
life O
, O
all O
the O
more O
so O
as O
the O
political O
situation O
also O
foresaw O
an O
imminent O
end O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
armies O
in O
Africa B-LOC
, O
Sicily B-LOC
, O
Italy B-LOC
, O
etc O
. O

, O
which O
had O
been O
driven O
out O
and O
received O
ever O
greater O
blows O
. O

But O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
this O
improvement O
had O
only O
occurred O
gradually O
and O
towards O
the O
end O
. O

The O
number O
of O
deaths O
had O
dropped O
from O
the O
record O
number O
of O
1942 B-DATE
/205 O
daily/ O
to O
20 O
- O
30 O
deaths O
daily O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
however O
, O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
change O
of O
circumstances O
, O
excitements O
and O
incidents O
of O
all O
and O
unpleasant O
kinds O
were O
always O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
, O
people O
were O
constantly O
locked O
up O
, O
taken O
to O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
, O
beaten O
half O
or O
completely O
dead O
during O
interrogation O
, O
badly O
mistreated O
, O
etc O
. O

One O
of O
the O
worst O
SS O
people O
, O
who O
was O
feared O
everywhere O
, O
was O
Scharführer O
Heinl B-PERS
. O

He O
seemed O
like O
a O
pike O
in O
a O
carp O
pond O
, O
he O
was O
always O
out O
and O
about O
in O
the O
ghetto O
and O
suddenly O
appeared O
exactly O
where O
he O
was O
not O
expected O
and O
saw O
someone O
secretly O
smoking O
or O
bringing O
stolen O
vegetables O
home O
or O
doing O
other O
prohibited O
things O
, O
such O
as O
carrying O
items O
stolen O
back O
from O
the O
closet O
/the O
technical O
term O
was O
ausschleussen O
/. O
There O
were O
always O
slaps O
in O
the O
face O
, O
imprisonment O
, O
and O
the O
next O
evacuation O
threatened O
. O

This O
Public O
Enemy O
No.1 O
as O
we O
called O
him O
later O
took O
over O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
clothing O
closet O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Czech B-LOC
gendarmes O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Oberwachtmeister O
Novak B-PERS
and O
the O
Sergeant O
Pribyl B-PERS
. O

These O
two O
gendarmes O
, O
who O
would O
like O
to O
be O
particularly O
praised O
, O
behaved O
very O
well O
to O
us O
ghetto O
inmates O
at O
all O
times O
, O
helped O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
as O
they O
could O
, O
always O
secretly O
stood O
in O
the O
sharpest O
opposition O
to O
the O
Nazis O
because O
they O
were O
ardent O
Czech B-LOC
nationalists O
and O
did O
all O
possible O
harm O
to O
the O
Nazis O
. O

They O
supported O
everyone O
who O
somehow O
came O
into O
contact O
with O
them O
, O
they O
came O
to O
our O
theater O
performances O
of O
Czech B-LOC
operas O
in O
disguise O
and O
really O
did O
their O
best O
for O
a O
good O
cause O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
had O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
outwardly O
. O

Herr O
Heinl O
now O
led O
the O
toughest O
regiment O
in O
the O
clothing O
closet O
, O
there O
were O
several O
incidents O
every O
day O
, O
people O
had O
to O
undress O
naked O
, O
it O
didn't O
matter O
that O
members O
of O
the O
opposite O
sex O
were O
present O
, O
scenes O
of O
slapping O
proceeded O
without O
pause O
, O
Heinl O
was O
always O
on O
the O
body O
searches O
of O
arriving O
transports O
and O
was O
so O
brutal O
in O
finding O
forbidden O
objects O
on O
the O
transport O
participants O
that O
he O
even O
hit O
and O
kicked O
old O
men O
or O
women O
. O

The O
female O
transport O
participants O
were O
always O
stripped O
naked O
in O
a O
separate O
room O
and O
searched O
by O
3 O
female O
Gestapo B-ORG
officers O
. O

These O
were O
3 O
ugly O
, O
vulgar O
older O
women O
from O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
helped O
by O
some O
ghetto O
inmates O
and O
1 O
or O
2 O
female O
Jewish O
detectives O
. O

These O
female O
Gestapo B-ORG
officers O
were O
also O
otherwise O
very O
feared O
, O
as O
they O
never O
let O
us O
rest O
under O
the O
gendarmerie O
and O
ghetto O
guard O
assistance O
, O
with O
constant O
house O
and O
barracks O
searches O
. O

They O
always O
confiscated O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
contraband O
, O
which O
most O
of O
the O
ghetto O
inmates O
still O
had O
in O
large O
numbers O
. O

Wherever O
they O
came O
across O
cigarettes O
or O
money O
they O
confiscated O
it O
, O
and O
when O
there O
were O
no O
or O
only O
trustworthy O
viewers O
they O
kept O
it O
and O
did O
not O
report O
anything O
. O

However O
, O
if O
larger O
sums O
of O
money O
or O
numbers O
of O
cigarettes O
were O
found O
, O
the O
owners O
were O
beaten O
up O
, O
locked O
up O
and O
could O
expect O
to O
be O
on O
the O
next O
transport O
. O

These O
ladies O
were O
commonly O
called O
Berušky O
based O
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
word O
bráti O
/to O
take/. O
Some O
gendarmes O
/ O
Drahonovsky B-PERS
, O
Sykora B-PERS
/ O
excelled O
in O
providing O
assistance O
in O
an O
inglorious O
way O
, O
because O
they O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
reports O
and O
even O
doled O
out O
slaps O
in O
the O
face O
. O

When O
the O
Berušky O
approached O
, O
all O
contraband O
was O
hidden O
or O
carried O
away O
by O
the O
inmates O
if O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
. O

Even O
so O
, O
much O
was O
still O
found O
. O

One O
day O
an O
order O
was O
finally O
given O
to O
clear O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks O
too O
. O

Here O
, O
too O
, O
3,500 O
women O
were O
affected O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
had O
to O
be O
housed O
in O
attics O
and O
some O
in O
barracks O
that O
had O
just O
been O
vacated O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
the O
otherwise O
so O
strict O
space O
management O
gave O
special O
permits O
so O
that O
women O
could O
move O
in O
with O
their O
husbands O
in O
attics O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
other O
attic O
occupants O
did O
not O
raise O
any O
objections O
. O

This O
was O
very O
welcome O
to O
me O
. O

My O
wife O
was O
always O
with O
me O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
cook O
anyway O
and O
only O
left O
at O
9 O
or O
10 O
at O
curfew O
, O
which O
had O
been O
very O
uncomfortable O
for O
us O
, O
so O
from O
now O
on O
she O
always O
stayed O
with O
us O
overnight O
and O
slept O
on O
the O
big O
couch O
. O

Also O
my O
colleague O
Malinovski B-PERS
often O
had O
his O
wife O
at O
our O
house O
at O
night O
and O
we O
not O
only O
didn’t O
bother O
each O
other O
but O
led O
a O
very O
sociable O
life O
together O
. O

And O
again O
there O
were O
evacuations O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1944 B-DATE
. O

This O
time O
we O
were O
all O
afraid O
, O
because O
the O
AK O
no O
longer O
protected O
and O
none O
of O
us O
had O
such O
a O
position O
that O
made O
him O
indispensable O
or O
influential O
acquaintances O
on O
the O
line O
who O
could O
keep O
him O
. O

The O
danger O
for O
our O
parents O
was O
particularly O
great O
. O

On O
the O
first O
transport O
, O
the O
Malinovskis B-PERS
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
was O
beset O
by O
misfortune O
and O
despite O
the O
children O
's O
best O
efforts O
to O
get O
her O
out O
, O
she O
had O
to O
go O
, O
so O
Andrej B-PERS
and O
his O
wife O
went O
with O
them O
voluntarily O
. O

The O
separation O
was O
very O
touching O
, O
we O
had O
always O
been O
good O
friends O
the O
whole O
time O
and O
we O
didn't O
know O
if O
we O
would O
ever O
meet O
again O
. O

During O
the O
transport O
, O
fate O
met O
my O
friend O
Paul B-PERS
Dub I-PERS
and O
his O
wife O
Alice B-PERS
, O
with O
whom O
my O
Manička B-PERS
was O
very O
good O
friends O
from O
Prague B-LOC
and O
they O
had O
always O
lived O
together O
. O

We O
were O
deeply O
shaken O
and O
helped O
pack O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
. O

Everyone O
was O
in O
tears O
. O

I O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
both O
spouses O
, O
although O
they O
did O
not O
harmonize O
with O
one O
another O
and O
the O
beautiful O
Alice B-PERS
officially O
lived O
with O
another O
man O
. O

We O
were O
very O
sad O
about O
our O
friends O
leaving O
and O
couldn't O
get O
over O
it O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
then O
lived O
alone O
with O
Manička B-PERS
in O
the O
attic O
, O
almost O
like O
in O
civilian O
life O
, O
we O
had O
visitors O
every O
day O
and O
felt O
very O
happy O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Mother O
was O
healthy O
and O
with O
us O
every O
day O
. O

We O
also O
often O
wrote O
short O
cards O
to O
our O
Prague B-LOC
relatives O
, O
and O
often O
received O
messages O
and O
parcels O
from O
them O
, O
which O
always O
made O
us O
very O
happy O
. O

My O
wife O
's O
cousins O
​​were O
with O
us O
every O
day O
or O
we O
were O
with O
them O
. O

When O
we O
feared O
that O
the O
room O
management O
would O
send O
us O
an O
uncomfortable O
third O
roommate O
into O
the O
attic O
, O
we O
voluntarily O
took O
in O
our O
Prague B-LOC
friend O
Philipp B-PERS
Spira I-PERS
, O
who O
worked O
in O
agriculture O
and O
didn't O
come O
home O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
idyll O
only O
lasted O
2 O
months O
. O

Just O
as O
we O
had O
cleaned O
the O
attic O
of O
vermin O
one O
day O
, O
the O
order O
came O
to O
clear O
the O
large O
bank O
building O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
few O
other O
blocks O
, O
because O
the O
SS O
authorities O
wanted O
to O
move O
more O
members O
and O
offices O
. O

We O
had O
to O
move O
out O
with O
bleeding O
hearts O
, O
see O
the O
attic O
destroyed O
and O
be O
separated O
again O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
Jäger B-LOC
barracks O
, O
taking O
some O
pieces O
of O
furniture O
with O
me O
, O
which O
I O
managed O
to O
accommodate O
privately O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
group O
elder O
from O
the O
Jäger B-LOC
barracks O
in O
a O
common O
room O
there O
, O
and O
my O
wife O
went O
to O
the O
western O
barracks O
that O
had O
been O
set O
up O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
arrange O
ourselves O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
and O
thought O
we O
would O
hold O
out O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
. O

But O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
October B-DATE
, O
rumors O
about O
the O
transport O
came O
up O
again O
and O
quickly O
intensified O
. O

This O
time O
5000 O
men O
should O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
Reich O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
which O
way O
and O
where O
it O
was O
going O
, O
but O
it O
didn’t O
look O
good O
, O
as O
we O
had O
received O
little O
or O
no O
information O
about O
the O
recently O
departed O
transports O
. O

Spira B-PERS
was O
the O
next O
victim O
and O
went O
with O
the O
first O
1,500 O
men O
. O

Again O
, O
I O
was O
lucky O
, O
as O
before O
, O
but O
further O
mixed O
transports O
were O
announced O
. O

It O
looked O
like O
the O
whole O
ghetto O
would O
be O
liquidated O
and O
war O
invalids O
and O
people O
with O
war O
decorations O
who O
had O
previously O
been O
protected O
now O
had O
to O
register O
and O
most O
of O
them O
were O
put O
into O
line O
. O

Even O
the O
so O
- O
far O
protected O
half O
- O
breeds O
went O
to O
the O
registration O
and O
only O
a O
few O
managed O
to O
get O
to O
the O
machine O
, O
i.e O
. O

to O
have O
their O
protection O
confirmed O
. O

Mother O
, O
Manička B-PERS
and O
I O
were O
also O
added O
to O
the O
6th O
transport O
. O

The O
schleusse O
was O
in O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks O
, O
as O
from O
there O
the O
path O
led O
through O
the O
back O
gate O
directly O
to O
the O
platform O
and O
the O
loading O
of O
the O
wagons O
was O
faster O
. O

There O
was O
great O
excitement O
, O
as O
not O
only O
the O
1,500 O
people O
lined O
up O
for O
the O
transport O
filled O
the O
rooms O
, O
but O
also O
, O
as O
always O
, O
a O
large O
reserve O
of O
500 O
people O
, O
as O
well O
as O
large O
numbers O
of O
people O
who O
were O
not O
part O
of O
the O
transport O
, O
going O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

All O
toilets O
and O
washrooms O
were O
always O
full O
and O
dirty O
, O
people O
were O
no O
longer O
embarrassed O
about O
each O
other O
and O
women O
washed O
themselves O
naked O
in O
front O
of O
men O
and O
vice O
versa O
. O

Large O
numbers O
of O
Kripo B-ORG
and O
ghetto O
guards O
, O
as O
well O
as O
officials O
, O
tried O
to O
maintain O
order O
, O
or O
rather O
mainly O
to O
help O
their O
own O
people O
. O

Moving O
children O
of O
the O
Protectorate O
was O
already O
less O
possible O
this O
time O
, O
but O
it O
was O
all O
the O
more O
striking O
. O

I O
was O
very O
scared O
out O
of O
consideration O
for O
my O
lung O
disease O
because O
I O
could O
hardly O
go O
to O
work O
. O

However O
, O
the O
intervention O
of O
the O
attending O
physician O
did O
not O
help O
, O
we O
had O
to O
go O
because O
it O
was O
not O
our O
ability O
to O
work O
but O
our O
ability O
to O
travel O
that O
made O
the O
difference O
. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
go O
through O
the O
terrible O
crowd O
to O
the O
barracks O
exit O
with O
all O
our O
luggage O
and O
were O
brought O
into O
the O
coupe O
. O

The O
luggage O
was O
crammed O
in O
through O
the O
window O
with O
great O
speed O
, O
so O
that O
we O
all O
almost O
suffocated O
, O
as O
tight O
as O
we O
were O
already O
packed O
. O

Heinl B-PERS
hit O
everyone O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barracks O
, O
including O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
, O
it O
was O
brutal O
. O

The O
train O
left O
on O
October B-DATE
12th I-DATE
in O
the O
evening O
, O
we O
waited O
until O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
in O
Bauschowitz B-LOC
, O
then O
it O
went O
via O
Aussig B-LOC
, O
Tetschen B-LOC
, O
Pirna B-LOC
to O
Dresden B-LOC
, O
we O
liked O
the O
train O
journey O
very O
much O
after O
such O
a O
long O
time O
and O
we O
hoped O
, O
according O
to O
the O
rumors O
, O
to O
get O
to O
Königstein B-LOC
or O
Riesa B-LOC
soon O
. O

But O
our O
hopes O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
deceptive O
and O
we O
passed O
these O
cities O
without O
having O
to O
get O
out O
. O

From O
Dresden B-LOC
we O
drove O
eastwards O
and O
I O
immediately O
suspected O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
maybe O
even O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

But O
I O
had O
only O
a O
very O
faint O
idea O
of O
​​Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
at O
least O
I O
knew O
nothing O
about O
the O
horrors O
that O
awaited O
us O
. O

We O
passed O
Bautzen B-LOC
, O
Görlitz B-LOC
, O
Breslau B-LOC
and O
my O
hunch O
became O
a O
certainty O
. O

After O
3 O
days O
we O
arrived O
in O
Katowice B-LOC
and O
finally O
in O
the O
terrible O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
what O
was O
going O
on O
there O
is O
now O
generally O
known O
. O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
write O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
because O
I O
immediately O
suffer O
a O
mental O
depression O
again O
if O
I O
only O
hear O
the O
terrible O
name O
. O

Re O
: O
New O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
seem O
determined O
to O
solve O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
with O
drastic O
measures O
, O
sending O
a O
great O
number O
of O
Semtic O
elements O
to O
the O
occupied O
Russian B-LOC
territories O
. O

These O
deportations O
had O
already O
started O
during O
last O
winter O
and O
involved O
the O
Jews O
living O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
Bukovina B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
accused O
of O
having O
welcomed O
the O
Bolshevik O
occupation O
, O
and O
those O
in O
Moldavia B-LOC
, O
who O
during O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
war O
had O
stirred O
up O
Communist O
riots O
in O
Jassy B-LOC
and O
in O
Galatz B-LOC
that O
were O
immediately O
suppressed O
. O

The O
system O
now O
has O
been O
extended O
to O
other O
regions O
and O
towns O
, O
including O
the O
capital B-LOC
, O
where O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
the O
police O
have O
carried O
out O
vast O
round O

ups O
among O
the O
Jewish O
element O
and O
have O
sent O
the O
people O
arrested O
beyond O
the O
Dnestr B-LOC
and O
beyond O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
, O
mainly O
road O
works O
, O
but O
reportedly O
last O
winter O
many O
, O
due O
also O
to O
lack O
of O
equipment O
and O
of O
suitable O
lodgings O
, O
did O
not O
survive O
the O
long O
marches O
from O
one O

the O
other O
and O
the O
rigours O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
winter O
. O

News O
of O
these O
measures O
spread O
rapidly O
even O
abroad O
, O
causing O
the O
United B-LOC

to O
send O
a O
protest O
note O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG

their O

However O
, O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
government O
, O
during O
the O
last O
meeting O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
decided O
to O
ignore O
the O
American O

to O
carry O
on O
with O
the O
deportations O
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
the O
Jews O
to O
be O
sent O
beyond O
the O
Dniestr B-LOC
have O
been O
classed O

according O
to O
a O
list O
that O

who O
in O
their O

deluded O
themselves O
that O

The O

disapproves O
of O

what O
they O

Among O
the O
Jews O
there O
is O
resentment O

gangs O

broke O
into O
their O

harsh O
orders O

anyone O

be O

do O
this O

“ O

the O

The O

printed O
articles O

many O

advancing O
the O

that O

contrary O
to O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity O
, O
violated O
the O
Constitution O
, O
and O
was O

The O
Gentile O

stressed O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
Jews O

assimilate O
, O
their O
practicing O
a O
doctrine O
of O
race O
defense O

their O
inferior O

their O
failure O

the O

it O

In O
the O
last O
analysis O
, O
many O
responsible O
Hungarians O
are O
wondering O
what O
will O
become O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
especially O
the O
poorer O
ones O
, O
when O
they O
are O
deprived O
of O
their O
means O
of O
livelihood O
. O

They O
feel O
that O
the O
Government O
is O
making O
a O
huge O
problem O
for O
itself O
by O
accelerating O
this O
problem O
without O
sufficient O
preparation O
. O

The O
German O
Minister O
told O
me O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
possible O
for O
the O
Hungarians O
to O
carry O
on O
an O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
policy O
as O
they O
conceived O
it O
because O
, O
unlike O
Germany O

there O
were O
no O

Gentiles O

replace O
the O
Jews O

This O
happened O
on O
the O
evening O
of O

23rd B-DATE
. O

A O
group O
of O
Jewish O
women O
of O
various O
nationalities O
came O
to O
Winter B-PERS
. O

The O
women O
were O
in O
terrible O
condition O
. O

They O
had O
footwear O
that O
was O
almost O
entirely O
inadequate O
, O
were O
wrapped O
in O
rags O
, O
possessed O
not O
even O
the O
most O
primitive O
objects O
of O
daily O
use O
, O
and O
their O
only O
luggage O
was O
a O
blanket O
that O
often O
served O
as O
a O
dress O
. O

Their O
heads O
were O
shaved O
and O
many O
were O
ill O
, O
and O
Winter B-PERS
was O
warned O
about O
Typhus O
. O

The O
inmates O
were O
abused O
by O
female O
guards O
in O
front O
of O
Winter B-PERS
and O
his O
wife O
and O
chased O
into O
the O
barns O
with O
shouts O
of O
get O
in O
, O
get O
in O
. O

Mrs O
. O

Winter B-PERS
, O
appalled O
by O
this O
picture O
, O
wanted O
to O
help O
some O
of O
the O
women O
. O

When O
one O
of O
the O
guards O
noticed O
, O
she O
called O
out O
, O
wanna O
join O
in O
? O
and O
kept O
chasing O
the O
inmates O
in O
. O

Winter B-PERS
estimates O
the O
number O
of O
inmates O
who O
stayed O
the O
night O
with O
him O
at O
around O
320 O
. O

From O
the O
short O
conversations O
that O
he O
and O
members O
of O
his O
family O
had O
with O
the O
inmates O
, O
he O
learned O
that O
most O
had O
long O
years O
of O
suffering O
in O
concentration O
camps O
behind O
them O
. O

They O
came O
from O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
, O
Ravensbrück B-CAMP
and O
other O
large O
concentration O
camps O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
they O
said O
that O
in O
some O
concentration O
camps O
where O
they O
worked O
in O
factories O
, O
things O
were O
a O
little O
better O
, O
but O
that O
since O
they O
had O
been O
evacuated O
there O
had O
been O
no O
proper O
food O
, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
inmates O
had O
already O
died O
or O
been O
killed O
on O
the O
way O
, O
and O
that O
for O
many O
death O
was O
a O
relief O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Winter B-PERS
himself O
is O
not O
aware O
of O
anyone O
from O
the O
inmate O
trains O
who O
was O
killed O
in O
the O
Teplá B-LOC
area O
. O

On O
his O
own O
initiative O
, O
says O
Winter B-PERS
, O
he O
cooked O
soup O
for O
those O
who O
were O
ill O
, O
and O
a O
female O
guard O
tried O
to O
prevent O
it O
from O
being O
distributed O
, O
but O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O

According O
to O
the O
order O
, O
potatoes O
were O
cooked O
for O
all O
inmates O
. O

Winter B-PERS
also O
remembers O
the O
following O
scenes O
: O
When O
some O
of O
the O
inmates O
, O
exhausted O
, O
sank O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
were O
chased O
into O
the O
barn O
with O
blows O
, O
he O
heard O
a O
squad O
leader O
say O
: O
Now O
I O
have O
had O
enough O
. O

With O
these O
words O
, O
Winter B-PERS
says O
, O
the O
overseer O
announced O
his O
intention O
to O
leave O
the O
train O
and O
to O
desert O
, O
because O
it O
was O
already O
too O
much O
for O
him O
. O

On O
25 B-DATE

came O
another O
train O
of O
inmates O
, O
this O
time O
men O
, O
in O
much O
better O
condition O
: O
striped O
clothes O
, O
different O
nationalities O
, O
but O
no O
Jews O
and O
demanded O
overnight O
accommodation O
. O

Winter B-PERS
refused O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
the O
barns O
were O
contaminated O
and O
he O
had O
not O
yet O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
clean O
them O
. O

To O
prevent O
infection O
, O
he O
sent O
her O
to O
another O
monastery O
estate O
. O

Finally O
, O
Winter B-PERS
states O
that O
many O
of O
the O
inmates O
promised O
to O
write O
, O
but O
he O
has O
not O
received O
any O
news O
yet O
. O

He O
never O
thought O
that O
such O
a O
thing O
would O
be O

us O
to O
the O
guardsmen B-ORG

Luckily O
, O
our O
uncle O
received O
the O
adoption O
documents O
that O
day O
and O
the O
guardsmen B-ORG
had O
to O
let O
us O
go O

Sealed O
Apartment O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
school O
. O

Jewish O
children O
weren’t O
allowed O
to O
, O
but O
my O
uncle O
managed O
to O
get O
me O
accepted O
. O

I O
was O
in O
4th O
grade O
when O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
uprising O
began O
. O

On O
September B-DATE
7th I-DATE
, O
I O
came O
home O
from O
school O
to O
find O
that O
the O
apartment O
had O
been O
sealed O
. O

I O
knew O
what O
this O
meant O
: O
the O
guardsmen B-ORG
were O
looking O
for O
us O
. O

They O
were O
deporting O
people O
. O

I O
met O
up O
with O
my O
uncle O
in O
a O
cellar O
that O
he O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
if O
this O
should O
ever O
happen O
. O

Then O
I O
hid O
in O
the O
villages O
around O
Nitra B-LOC
. O

My O
last O
hiding O
place O
was O
at O
a O
worker O
’ O
s O
house O
in O
Nitra B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
connected O
to O
the O
partisans O
and O
hid O
up O
to O
15 O
Jewish O
children O
. O

But O
the O
guardsman B-ORG
who O
deported O
father O
and O
mother O
2 O
years O
ago O
found O
out O
. O

The O
Prison O
in O
Hlinka B-ORG
House O
They O
took O
me O
to O
the O
Hlinka B-ORG
house O
. O

To O
the O
cellar O
. O

About O
30 O
people O
were O
already O
there O
and O
more O
kept O
coming O
, O
and O
so O
there O
was O
nowhere O
to O
sit O
. O

We O
didn’t O
have O
enough O
air O
; O
we O
were O
suffocating O
. O

They O
didn’t O
let O
us O
go O
out O
, O
not O
even O
to O
the O
bathroom O
and O
so O
the O
cellar O
stank O
terribly O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
bread O
to O
eat O
, O
roughly O
the O
size O
of O
a O
matchbox O
, O
and O
coffee O
, O
at O
noon O
some O
watery O
soup O
and O
again O
a O
small O
slice O
of O
bread O
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
only O
coffee O
. O

I O
spent O
8 O
days O
in O
the O
Hlinka B-ORG
house O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
found O
out O
that O
my O
uncle O

who O
had O
had O
an O
operation O
and O
was O
recovering O
in O
the O
hospital O

was O
dragged O
away O

he O
still O
had O
an O
open O
wound O

I O
don’t O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
him O

I O
also O
never O

Then O
they O

two O

three O

The O
ghetto O

The O

the O
German B-LOC
Biebow B-PERS

Life O
was O
very O
hard O
here O

The O
worst O
thing O
was O
hunger O

We O
didn’t O
get O
enough O
food O
. O

We O
often O
had O
to O
cook O
grass O
. O

Grandma O
died O
of O
hunger O
here O

Many O
people O
died O
here O
in O

There O
were O
about O
20,000 O

the O
ghetto O

roughly O
3,000 O

which O
were O
from O

We O
could O
only O
write O

they O
weren’t O

We O
were O
given O
printed O
German B-LOC

stated O
that O
we O
were O
doing O
well O

we O
were O
told O

The O
ghetto O
was O
completely O
cut O
off O

the O
rest O

We O
didn’t O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
beyond O
its O
tall O
walls O

barbed O
wire O

A O
railroad O
track O
passed O
through O
the O
ghetto O
with O
several O
bridges O
across O
it O

and O
so O
we O
couldn’t O
meet O
anybody O

We O
weren’t O
allowed O

go O
outside O

It O

the O

When O
I O

In O

One O
day O

the O
German B-LOC

closed O
off O
our O

The O
Germans B-LOC
went O
from O

out O

They O
made O
us O
hurry O

Everything O

There O

to O
move O
out O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
turned O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
into O
a O
ghetto O
. O

Right O
about O
that O
time O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
Seidl B-PERS
was O
sent O
to O
the O
front O
and O
SS O
Obersturmführer O
Burger B-PERS
arrived O
to O
replace O
him O
. O

He O
was O
later O
replaced O
by O
SS O
Obersturmführer O
Rahm B-PERS
. O

Burger B-PERS
was O
the O
worst O
of O
them O
. O

He O
loved O
to O
beat O
people O
and O
let O
people O
starve O
. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
poor O
. O

We O
received O
a O
small O
loaf O
of O
bread O
, O
which O
was O
usually O
moldy O
, O
every O
4 O
days O
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
we O
could O
only O
write O
once O
every O
3 O
months O
, O
and O
no O
more O
than O
30 O
words O
, O
all O
of O
them O
positive O
. O

The O
whole O
time O
we O
were O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
almost O
3 O
years O
, O
we O
received O
2 O
letters O
and O
6 O
packages O
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
it O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
speak O
any O
other O
language O
except O
German B-LOC
, O
and O
so O
all O
our O
letters O
were O
written O
in O
German B-LOC
. O

When O
they O
moved O
the O
inhabitants O
out O
of O
the O
town O
, O
we O
could O
walk O
around O
the O
whole O
town O
freely O
because O
only O
prisoners O
lived O
in O
the O
houses O
. O

However O
, O
we O
weren’t O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
town O
, O
only O
to O
go O
to O
work O
accompanied O
by O
the O
guards O
. O

We O
didn’t O
receive O
any O
news O
. O

We O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
was O
happening O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Smoking O
wasn’t O
allowed O
. O

If O
they O
found O
you O
with O
a O
cigarette O
they O
would O
punish O
you O
. O

People O
were O
hanged O
almost O
every O
day O
. O

People O
were O
executed O
if O
a O
radio O
or O
a O
record O
player O
was O
found O
among O
your O
things O
, O
if O
they O
wrote O
the O
truth O
without O
permission O
, O
if O
they O
went O
outside O
of O
the O
town O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
hung O
a O
Czech B-LOC
policeman O
for O
bringing O
a O
letter O
to O
a O
prisoner O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
stole O
our O
possessions O
and O
then O
sold O
them O
in O
the O
stores O
that O
they O
opened O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

These O
stores O
were O
mostly O
there O
for O
propaganda O
purposes O
. O

They O
showed O
them O
to O
foreign O
journalists O
to O
show O
how O
well O
we O
were O
treated O
and O
what O
goods O
we O
could O
purchase O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
bought O
our O
own O
things O
back O
from O
these O
stores O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
had O
to O
work O
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
work O
, O
but O
couldn’t O
be O
compared O
to O
what O
awaited O
us O
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Healthy O
men O
and O
women O
worked O
for O
12 O
hours O
per O
day O
in O
the O
fields O
and O
workshops O
. O

Older O
men O
and O
women O
were O
given O
easier O
jobs O
. O

Many O
people O
died O
, O
mostly O
from O
malnutrition O
. O

There O
were O
many O
orphans O
. O

Germans B-LOC
soon O
started O
to O
transport O
people O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

The O
transports O
were O
headed O
for O
Poland B-LOC
, O
but O
where O
exactly O
we O
didn’t O
know O
. O

We O
did O
know O
, O
however O
, O
that O
somewhere O
in O
that O
land O
were O
gas O
chambers O
and O
that O
going O
to O
Poland B-LOC
was O
a O
death O
sentence O
. O

Everyone O
did O
what O
they O
could O
to O
avoid O
being O
deported O
. O

People O
would O
say O
that O
they O
were O
sick O
, O
they O
would O
bribe O
German B-LOC
officials O
. O

In O
some O
instances O
, O
people O
tried O
to O
commit O
suicide O
. O

When O
they O
were O
saved O
and O
brought O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
they O
bought O
themselves O
some O
time O
. O

My O
turn O
came O
along O
with O
my O
father O
, O
mother O
, O
and O
sister O
in O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
. O

Few O
people O
were O
left O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
then O
, O
only O
about O
10,000 O
. O

The O
transport O
I O
was O
on O
contained O
about O
7,000 O
people O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
they O
placed O
boards O
with O
numbers O
around O
our O
necks O
, O
locked O
us O
in O
so O
we O
wouldn’t O
run O
away O
, O
and O
didn’t O
feed O
us O
for O
3 O
days O
. O

Then O
they O
rushed O
us O
onto O
the O
train O
and O
stuffed O
us O
into O
the O
cars O
. O

They O
swore O
at O
us O
and O
beat O
us O
. O

We O
were O
finally O
given O
food O
for O
the O
journey O
: O
1 O
kg O
of O
bread O
, O
10 O
dkg O
of O
sugar O
, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
salami O
and O
margarine O
. O

We O
rode O
for O
two O
days O
. O

We O
were O
all O
in O
a O
terrible O
state O
, O
because O
we O
knew O
that O
something O
terrible O
awaited O
us O
. O

The O
train O
stopped O
at O
a O
ramp O
. O

SS O
- O
men O
stood O
outside O
and O
we O
saw O
people O
in O
prison O
uniforms O
. O

They O
hurried O
us O
out O
of O
the O
cars O
; O
we O
couldn’t O
take O
our O
luggage O
and O
never O
saw O
it O
again O
. O

The O
guards O
beat O
us O
. O

One O
prisoner O
, O
seeing O
me O
with O
my O
sister O
, O
told O
me O
to O
say O
that O
we O
were O
twins O
because O
it O
might O
save O
me O
. O

The O
camp O
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
. O

When O
any O
of O
the O
transported O
people O
got O
close O
to O
it O
, O
they O
were O
killed O
. O

The O
wires O
were O
electrified O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-LOC
didn’t O
tell O
us O
. O

They O
rejoiced O
whenever O
any O
of O
us O
touched O
the O
wires O
. O

This O
was O
how O
we O
were O
greeted O
in O
the O
Birkenau B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
. O

In O
one O
of O
Alexei B-PERS
Tolstoy I-PERS
’ O
s O
articles O
, O
a O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
soldier I-ORG
thinks O
about O
a O
child O
that O
was O
being O
tortured O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

A O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
Ivan O
Karamazov O
asked O
his O
brother O
Alyosha O
: O
if O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
sacrifice O
only O
one O
child O
, O
to O
torture O
it O
to O
death O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
mankind O
to O
be O
guaranteed O
— O
would O
you O
be O
capable O
to O
doing O
it O
? O
Ivan O
Karamazov O
thought O
that O
he O
was O
asking O
Alyosha O
a O
question O
that O
couldn’t O
be O
answered O
. O

Alyosha O
was O
quiet O
and O
didn’t O
answer O
. O

To O
torture O
to O
death O
a O
child O
, O
what O
could O
be O
more O
horrible O
? O
Yes O
, O
maybe O
for O
all O
of O
mankind O
to O
be O
happy O
… O
such O
happiness O
would O
be O
cursed O
… O
but O
Karamazov O
’s O
riddle O
was O
solved O
in O
the O
simplest O
way O
. O

They O
were O
solving O
it O
right O
now O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
would O
torture O
to O
death O
a O
child O
, O
but O
I O
should O
be O
that O
child O
. O

And O
it O
’s O
an O
empty O
, O
made O
- O
up O
question O
anyway O
. O

Life O
posed O
us O
a O
different O
question O
. O

To O
save O
even O
a O
single O
child O
, O
this O
child O
, O
from O
suffering O
, O
is O
anyone O
who O
considers O
himself O
a O
human O
willing O
to O
fight O
for O
life O
and O
death O
? O
It O
’s O
a O
direct O
question O
and O
the O
answer O
is O
clear O
. O

Yes O
, O
even O
I O
, O
Grisha O
, O
even O
machine O
- O
gunner O
Ivan O
and O
the O
other O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG

will O
answer O
: O
we O
are O
willing O
. O

Alexei B-PERS
Tolstoy I-PERS
ends O
his O
ruminations O
by O
saying O
: O
let O
’s O
ask O
ourselves O
this O
question O
practically O
. O

We O
demand O
a O
settlement O
. O

Three O
million O
Germans B-LOC
for O
the O
single O
murdered O
child O
, O
three O
million O
blonds O
with O
thin O
necks O
, O
doe O
- O
eyed O
lashes O
, O
and O
degenerate O
brains O
. O

How O
many O
Germans B-LOC
should O
be O
sentenced O
to O
death O
just O
for O
the O
children O
murdered O
in O
the O
Birkenau B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
? O
Birkenau B-CAMP
Everyone O
here O
beat O
us O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
we O
arrived O
, O
continues O
Petr B-PERS
. O

The O
guards O
beat O
us O
, O
the O
overseers O
beat O
us O
, O
even O
the O
senior O
in O
the O
barracks O
beat O
us O
. O

Roll O
call O
was O
at O
5 O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

This O
meant O
another O
beating O
. O

They O
counted O
us O
and O
led O
us O
to O
the O
showers O
. O

We O
were O
afraid O
that O
they O
would O
be O
gas O
chambers O
. O

But O
they O
were O
real O
showers O
. O

There O
, O
they O
took O
the O
last O
of O
our O
possessions O
away O
from O
us O
and O
gave O
us O
prisoner O
uniforms O
: O
pants O
and O
a O
jacket O
. O

We O
wore O
this O
in O
summer O
as O
well O
as O
in O
winter O
. O

The O
children O
got O
to O
keep O
their O
shoes O
. O

Then O
they O
tattooed O
numbers O
on O
our O
arms O
. O

My O
number O
was O
A O
- O
77 O
. O

We O
didn’t O
eat O
anything O
for O
two O
days O
. O

Then O
we O
got O
camp O
food O
: O
beet O
soup O
, O
200 O
g O
of O
bread O
, O
and O
a O
spoonful O
of O
beet O
marmalade O
. O

After O
we O
ate O
the O
marmalade O
, O
we O
all O
got O
horrible O
diarrhea O
and O
people O
died O
. O

We O
were O
shut O
in O
our O
barracks O
, O
nobody O
was O
allowed O
out O
, O
not O
even O
to O
the O
bathroom O
. O

And O
for O
every O
soiling O
they O
beat O
us O
cruelly O
. O

Experiments O
on O
Twins O
Then O
the O
camp O
doctor O
, O
SS O
- O
Hauptsturmführer O
Mengele B-PERS
, O
arrived O
. O

He O
was O
a O
terrible O
person O
. O

He O
selected O
who O
would O
be O
gassed O
and O
who O
would O
live O
. O

When O
he O
sent O
someone O
to O
the O
chimneys O
, O
he O
did O
so O
politely O
and O
said O
that O
he O
was O
sending O
them O
somewhere O
where O
they O
would O
be O
better O
off O
. O

Mengele B-PERS
would O
have O
twins O
summoned O
. O

It O
was O
his O
hobby O
. O

He O
conducted O
medical O
experiments O
on O
them O
and O
until O
the O
twin O
died O
from O
them O
nothing O
was O
supposed O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

He O
would O
often O
take O
blood O
samples O
from O
us O
, O
sometimes O
even O
from O
our O
ears O
. O

Once O
, O
he O
took O
so O
much O
blood O
from O
us O
that O
we O
couldn’t O
get O
up O
for O
several O
days O
. O

He O
busied O
himself O
with O
us O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
. O

During O
the O
last O
week O
when O
the O
front O
was O
coming O
closer O
he O
didn’t O
have O
time O
for O
us O
. O

The O
experiments O
saved O
my O
life O
because O
small O
children O
like O
me O
were O
considered O
useless O
and O
went O
to O
the O
chimneys O
. O

A O
Natural O
Death O
E O
camp O
was O
built O
for O
10,000 O
people O
, O
but O
they O
stuffed O
14,000 O
into O
it O
. O

It O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Czech B-LOC
camp O
. O

Within O
6 O
months O
, O
about O
half O
of O
the O
people O
there O
died O
a O
natural O
death O
. O

The O
work O
was O
hard O
. O

We O
hammered O
rocks O
, O
dug O
out O
earth O
, O
and O
hauled O
mud O
away O
from O
the O
swamps O
on O
which O
the O
camp O
was O
built O
. O

Between O
the O
barracks O
were O
piles O
of O
corpses O
. O

Bloody O
, O
beaten O
, O
they O
often O
laid O
there O
for O
several O
days O
and O
stank O
horribly O
. O

We O
got O
used O
to O
it O
. O

While O
people O
worked O
, O
they O
saw O
dead O
bodies O
all O
the O
time O
. O

When O
someone O
could O
no O
longer O
go O
on O
working O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
throw O
him O
onto O
the O
pile O
of O
corpses O
, O
and O
if O
he O
didn’t O
die O
fast O
enough O
they O
would O
beat O
him O
to O
death O
. O

They O
often O
threw O
a O
husband O
onto O
the O
pile O
of O
corpses O
in O
front O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
a O
child O
in O
front O
of O
its O
mother O
, O
etc O
. O

And O
With O
Gas O
In O
July B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
they O
took O
away O
the O
healthy O
men O
, O
supposedly O
to O
go O
work O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Only O
women O
, O
the O
elderly O
, O
the O
sick O
, O
and O
children O
remained O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
the O
Gypsy O
camp O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
they O
took O
the O
twins O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
, O
during O
the O
night O
, O
sent O
all O
of O
the O
Gypsies O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
along O
with O
6,000 O
people O
from O
camp O
E. O
During O
this O
time O
, O
large O
transports O
began O
arriving O
, O
mostly O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-LOC
were O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
, O
they O
first O
separated O
the O
people O
from O
the O
transport O
into O
groups O
and O
sent O
some O
to O
the O
camp O
, O
but O
they O
sometimes O
sent O
entire O
transports O
from O
the O
train O
cars O
directly O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
. O

The O
hospital O
was O
right O
next O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
and O
crematoria O
( O
there O
were O
4 O
in O
total O
) O
and O
I O
saw O
people O
standing O
in O
line O
in O
front O
of O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

They O
let O
as O
many O
people O
in O
as O
the O
chambers O
would O
hold O
. O

Then O
cries O
could O
be O
heard O
for O
several O
minutes O
, O
and O
then O
everything O
was O
quiet O
and O
more O
would O
enter O
. O

Prisoners O
— O
Russians B-LOC
and O
Jews O
— O
also O
worked O
in O
the O
crematoria O
and O
gas O
chambers O
. O

Every O
two O
months O
, O
the O
Germans O
would O
kill O
the O
old O
workers O
, O
which O
they O
called O
the O
Sonderkommando O
, O
by O
gassing O
them O
, O
and O
would O
send O
new O
workers O
in O
. O

The O
crematoria O
couldn’t O
keep O
up O
when O
there O
was O
a O
big O
flood O
of O
people O
, O
and O
so O
the O
Germans B-LOC
burned O
corpses O
on O
large O
pyres O
. O

Every O
other O
day O
, O
and O
sometimes O
every O
single O
day O
, O
the O
medical O
committee O
would O
walk O
through O
the O
camp O
and O
“ O
select O
. O

” O
It O
would O
select O
the O
weak O
who O
could O
no O
longer O
work O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
be O
gassed O

, O
Poles B-LOC
. O

There O
were O
also O
many O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

Imprisoned O
Germans B-LOC
had O
a O
special O
position O
. O

They O
were O
mostly O
vulgar O
criminals O
, O
thieves O
, O
murderers O
, O
and O
swindlers O
. O

They O
guarded O
everyone O
else O
. O

There O
were O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
Russian B-LOC
POWs O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
treated O
them O
extremely O
cruelly O
. O

They O
died O
of O
hunger O
and O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
shoot O
them O
for O
any O
reason O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
small O
. O

Once O
, O
4 O
Russian B-LOC
POWs O
attempted O
to O
escape O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
caught O
them O
and O
hung O
them O
in O
front O
of O
all O
of O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

Before O
the O
men O
died O
, O
they O
cried O
out O
: O
Glory O
to O
the O
fatherland O
, O
glory O
to O
the O
RedArmy O
. O

After O
the O
execution O
, O
the O
camp O
commander O
asked O
the O
Russians B-LOC
whether O
they O
agreed O
with O
what O
was O
done O
to O
the O
4 O
men O
. O

All O
of O
the O
Russians B-LOC
shouted O
out O
: O
we O
don’t O
agree O
. O

The O
SS O
- O
men O
then O
began O
shooting O
them O
and O
killed O
many O
Russians B-LOC
. O

English B-LOC
POWs O
were O
also O
there O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
treated O
them O
very O
well O
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
camp O
, O
good O
food O
, O
they O
even O
got O
better O
cigarettes O
, O
walked O
around O
in O
their O
own O
uniforms O
, O
wore O
their O
awards O
and O
decorations O
. O

When O
the O
front O
drew O
closer O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
were O
very O
surprised O
. O

They O
said O
that O
they O
were O
counting O
on O
the O
English B-LOC
and O
Americans B-LOC
to O
arrive O
, O
but O
not O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

That O
’s O
why O
they O
treated O
the O
English B-LOC
POWs O
so O
well O
. O

The O
Last O
Days O
of O
Birkenau B-CAMP
About O
5 O
months O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army B-ORG
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
began O
to O
transport O
prisoners O
, O
apparently O
to O
go O
work O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

In O
December B-DATE
, O
they O
no O
longer O
transported O
anybody O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
were O
to O
be O
transported O
had O
to O
walk O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
asked O
those O
who O
could O
handle O
walking O
40 O
- O
50 O
km O
a O
day O
to O
come O
forward O
. O

People O
were O
scared O
not O
to O
go O
because O
they O
thought O
they O
would O
be O
killed O
otherwise O
. O

Mostly O
only O
women O
, O
the O
elderly O
, O
and O
the O
sick O
stayed O
behind O
. O

The O
more O
the O
front O
got O
closer O
, O
the O
more O
chaos O
there O
was O
. O

The O
order O
came O
down O
to O
liquidate O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
began O
to O
set O
fire O
to O
the O
warehouses O
. O

They O
had O
already O
blown O
up O
the O
crematoria O
and O
gas O
chambers O
. O

Then O
they O
led O
the O
remaining O
prisoners O
to O
the O
neighboring O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
. O

Auschwitz B-CAMP
Today O
, O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
is O
a O
blanket O
term O
for O
the O
whole O
system O
of O
torture O
chambers O
built O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
around O
the O
town O
with O
the O
same O
name O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
was O
only O
one O
of O
many O
camps O
. O

It O
was O
actually O
smaller O
than O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
which O
was O
planned O
for O
10,000 O
prisoners O
. O

The O
camps O
created O
something O
like O
a O
town O
with O
several O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
prisoners O
, O
all O
surrounded O
by O
a O
barbed O
wire O
electric O
fence O
, O
which O
was O
illuminated O
with O
light O
bulbs O
at O
night O
and O
small O
guard O
towers O
with O
machine O
guns O
every O
hundred O
meters O
( O
the O
so O
- O
called O
grosse O
Postenkette O
) O
. O

Each O
camp O
was O
once O
more O
surrounded O
by O
electrified O
barbed O
wires O
and O
guard O
towers O
( O
the O
so O
- O
called O
kleine O
Postenkette O
) O
, O
has O
its O
own O
railroad O
track O
, O
its O
own O
crematoria O
, O
own O
gas O
chambers O
, O
etc O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
each O
camp O
there O
were O
blocks O
separated O
by O
barbed O
wire O
fences O
. O

Each O
block O
had O
a O
number O
, O
held O
5 O
to O
10,000 O
people O
, O
and O
had O
its O
own O
purpose O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Birkenau B-CAMP
block O
A O
was O
the O
quarantine O
ward O
, O
B O
was O
the O
women O
’s O
camp O
, O
D O
the O
men O
’s O
camp O
, O
E O
the O
Gypsy O
camp O
, O
FKL O
for O
women O
with O
children O
, O
F O
the O
hospital O
, O
etc O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
say O
which O
concentration O
camp O
was O
the O
worst O
. O

Everywhere O
they O
killed O
with O
a O
German B-LOC
thoroughness O
and O
cold O
calculation O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
miracle O
that O
we O
weren’t O
sent O
to O
the O
chimneys O
, O
say O
Robert B-PERS
, O
Mario B-PERS
, O
and O
Petr B-PERS
. O

It O
was O
difficult O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
claws O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
executioners O
like O
the O
Lagerkommandantur O
of O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
: O
SS O
- O
Hauptsturmführer O
Hössler B-PERS
, O
SS O
- O
Obersturmführer O
Kaduk B-PERS
, O
who O
practiced O
shooting O
on O
live O
targets O
and O
relished O
aiming O
at O
the O
red O
signs O
that O
the O
prisoners O
had O
on O
their O
backs O
, O
Rapportführer O
Buldog B-PERS
, O
or O
the O
doctors O
SS O
- O
Hauptsturmführer O
Klein B-PERS
and O
SS O
- O
Obersturmführer O
Fischler B-PERS
. O

To O
toil O
away O
until O
we O
fell O
— O
that O
was O
our O
only O
hope O
to O
be O
saved O
. O

This O
was O
true O
for O
everyone O
, O
even O
children O
. O

If O
you O
could O
still O
stand O
on O
your O
feet O
and O
work O
, O
you O
would O
probably O
stay O
alive O
. O

This O
is O
why O
Mario B-PERS
cried O
when O
the O
young O
people O
didn’t O
want O
to O
accept O
him O
into O
the O
work O
group O
. O

He O
claimed O
to O
be O
16 O
years O
old O
and O
begged O
an O
imprisoned O
Frenchman B-LOC
to O
tattoo O
a O
number O
on O
his O
hand O
and O
add O
him O
to O
those O
who O
were O
able O
to O
work O
. O

Robert B-PERS
rose O
at O
3:30 O
a.m O
. O

and O
worked O
15 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

The O
ultimate O
goal O
of O
Hitler B-PERS
's I-PERS
new O
order O
is O
revealed O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
and O
Majdanek B-CAMP
: O
to O
turn O
people O
into O
working O
animals O
, O
slaves O
who O
have O
the O
right O
to O
live O
only O
if O
they O
are O
able O
to O
work O
. O

And O
then O
lead O
them O
to O
the O
slaughter O
like O
lame O
horses O
. O

The O
Rescuers O
The O
thundering O
of O
Soviet B-LOC
guns O
foreshadowed O
the O
rescue O
of O
10,000 O
of O
the O
6 O
million O
condemned O
people O
. O

The O
days O
and O
hours O
of O
waiting O
were O
awful O
. O

We O
didn’t O
know O
whether O
we O
would O
be O
saved O
in O
time O
, O
or O
whether O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
murder O
us O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
the O
prisoners O
already O
stood O
in O
rows O
of O
three O
and O
the O
Germans B-LOC
were O
readying O
their O
machine O
guns O
when O
news O
arrived O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
were O
here O
. O

The O
executioners O
fled O
. O

There O
are O
no O
words O
to O
express O
the O
liberated O
prisoners O
’ O
joy O
and O
gratefulness O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
heroes O
. O

No O
words O
were O
necessary O
. O

The O
Soviet B-LOC
soldier O
who O
stroked O
the O
heads O
of O
Petr B-PERS
, O
Mario B-PERS
, O
and O
Robert B-PERS
thought O
about O
his O
own O
children O
who O
had O
been O
killed O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
back O
home O
in O
Smolensk B-LOC
or O
Poltava B-LOC
, O
or O
had O
been O
dragged O
away O
into O
their O
hellhole O
. O

The O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
soldier I-ORG
smiled O
at O
the O
rescued O
children O
and O
then O
headed O
west O
, O
where O
millions O
more O
prisoners O
waited O
to O
be O
saved O
and O
millions O
of O
criminals O
awaited O
their O
punishment O
. O

At O
Home O
In O
Krakov B-LOC
, O
the O
children O
learned O
about O
our O
corps O
. O

On O
foot O
and O
in O
military O
vehicles O
they O
hurried O
to O
find O
us O
. O

Their O
documents O
were O
their O
tattooed O
numbers O
. O

When O
they O
made O
it O
to O
our O
unit O
, O
they O
begged O
our O
gray O
- O
haired O
lieutenant O
colonel O
, O
who O
had O
seen O
and O
experienced O
a O
lot O
and O
listened O
with O
emotion O
to O
their O
account O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
them O
: O
let O
us O
stay O
with O
your O
unit O
, O
we O
may O
be O
children O
, O
but O
we O
want O
to O
help O
you O
fight O
the O
Germans O
. O

It O
’s O
our O
right O
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
thought O
that O
children O
would O
never O
take O
revenge O
against O
them O
. O

But O
they O
were O
mistaken O
. O

The O
children O
’s O
revenge O
was O
their O
powerful O
testimony O
. O

And O
they O
are O
avengers O
, O
as O
are O
the O
millions O
of O
Soviet B-LOC
soldiers O
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
as O
are O
we O

We O
all O
sought O
revenge O
for O
Petr B-PERS

and O
the O
millions O

The O
welcome O

an O

, O
which O
contained O
, O
among O
other O
friendly O
words O
, O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
as O
to O
what O
belongings O
we O
would O
be O
allowed O
to O
keep O
, O
was O
concluded O
with O
a O
forceful O
Germanic O
utterance O
of O
Nichts O
, O
brooking O
no O
misunderstanding O
… O
Only O
a O
short O
while O
ago O
, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
to O
observe O
people O
, O
with O
sufficient O
presence O
of O
mind O
, O
transfer O
things O
from O
bag O
to O
rucksack O
, O
from O
rucksack O
to O
pants O
pocket O
, O
and O
vice O
versa O
, O
depending O
on O
what O
we O
all O
assumed O
would O
or O
wouldn’t O
be O
taken O
from O
us O
. O

Nobody O
spared O
a O
thought O
to O
our O
luggage O
, O
which O
had O
been O
left O
on O
the O
train O
. O

So O
we O
set O
our O
things O
aside O
and O
began O
to O
undress O
. O

In O
a O
certain O
sense O
, O
the O
fateful O
nichts O
was O
a O
relief O
. O

Still O
, O
at O
one O
point O
, O
I O
hesitated O
, O
pulling O
out O
of O
my O
breast O
pocket O
a O
small O
drawing O
that O
I O
hoped O
would O
accompany O
me O
wherever O
I O
went O
… O
That O
’s O
when O
I O
noticed O
that O
an O
old O
Lithuanian B-LOC
Jew O
was O
standing O
next O
to O
me O
. O

Only O
God O
knows O
why O
he O
wasn’t O
taken O
to O
heaven O
right O
at O
the O
train O
station O
during O
the O
sorting O
process O
, O
but O
instead O
was O
condemned O
to O
go O
through O
the O
most O
terrible O
hell O
first O
… O
He O
stood O
next O
to O
me O
, O
holding O
a O
violin O
in O
a O
canvas O
case O
under O
one O
arm O
and O
a O
small O
bag O
with O
prayer O
straps O
under O
the O
other O
. O

I O
watched O
him O
from O
the O
side O
as O
he O
bent O
down O
to O
his O
clothes O
, O
as O
if O
he O
didn’t O
know O
what O
to O
keep O
and O
what O
to O
leave O
. O

First O
the O
hand O
with O
the O
violin O
dropped O
down O
, O
then O
the O
hand O
with O
the O
straps O
. O

He O
finally O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
. O

He O
laid O
down O
the O
sack O
with O
the O
straps O
, O
covered O
it O
with O
his O
shirt O
, O
and O
stood O
upright O
with O
the O
violin O
under O
his O
arm O
. O

Noticing O
that O
I O
was O
observing O
him O
, O
he O
blushed O
and O
whispered O
, O
as O
if O
apologizing O
: O
I O
will O
pray O
over O
it O
, O
too O
, O
believe O
me O
, O
over O
it O
, O
too O
. O

The O
Lord O
God O
will O
forgive O
… O
Most O
of O
us O
crammed O
into O
this O
room O
were O
determined O
to O
smuggle O
in O
this O
or O
that O
item O
. O

One O
a O
book O
, O
the O
other O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
loved O
one O
, O
and O
the O
old O
Lithuanian B-LOC
Jew O
a O
violin O
. O

But O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
first O
person O
in O
line O
ask O
permission O
to O
keep O
a O
bible O
being O
slapped O
and O
seeing O
the O
bible O
fly O
out O
the O
window O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
photograph O
of O
the O
loved O
one O
of O
the O
man O
behind O
him O
torn O
up O
by O
the O
laughing O
SSman O
, O
I O
took O
a O
good O
look O
at O
my O
picture O
, O
gazed O
at O
it O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
my O
eyes O
projected O
it O
onto O
the O
deepest O
part O
of O
my O
soul O
, O
and O
placed O
the O
paper O
among O
my O
other O
things O
, O
taking O
its O
likeness O
to O
a O
place O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
the O
SSman O
’ O
s O
hand O
. O

Most O
of O
us O
did O
what O
I O
had O
just O
done O
. O

The O
line O
moved O
very O
slowly O
. O

When O
we O
were O
just O
in O
front O
of O
the O
SSman O
checking O
us O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
was O
still O
holding O
his O
violin O
in O
his O
trembling O
hands O
. O

They O
searched O
me O
rather O
quickly O
and O
when O
I O
looked O
back O
, O
I O
saw O
the O
old O
man O
whispering O
in O
broken O
German O
: O
Let O
me O
keep O
my O
violin O
, O
this O
old O
worthless O
violin O
, O
like O
me O
, O
an O
old O
and O
worthless O
man O
. O

Let O
me O
keep O
my O
violin O
. O

Everyone O
in O
the O
room O
stood O
frozen O
in O
horror O
. O

Would O
he O
be O
flogged O
like O
the O
one O
who O
had O
tried O
to O
smuggle O
in O
a O
ring O
, O
or O
would O
he O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
Dr O
. O

Mengele B-PERS
as O
proof O
of O
the O
mistake O
he O
had O
made O
during O
the O
sorting O
process O
? O
The O
SSman O
was O
first O
dumbstruck O
at O
the O
unprecedented O
action O
and O
insolence O
of O
the O
old O
man O
, O
but O
then O
shouted O
at O
him O
: O
Hau O
ab O
! O
and O
pointed O
his O
finger O
, O
ordering O
him O
to O
go O
forward O
. O

The O
old O
man O
trembled O
all O
over O
and O
held O
his O
violin O
firmly O
in O
his O
hands O
. O

We O
didn’t O
know O
whether O
the O
SSman O
had O
had O
a O
pang O
of O
conscience O
or O
was O
perhaps O
spurred O
on O
by O
more O
evil O
thoughts O
, O
but O
all O
of O
us O
knew O
that O
the O
story O
of O
the O
old O
man O
and O
the O
violin O
was O
far O
from O
over O
. O

Should O
I O
even O
bother O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
much O
guile O
, O
cleverness O
, O
and O
courage O
it O
took O
to O
smuggle O
a O
violin O
into O
the O
camp O
? O
I’d O
love O
to O
convey O
it O
in O
writing O
, O
but O
I O
don’t O
have O
the O
words O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Every O
capo O
who O
lined O
us O
up O
wanted O
to O
grab O
them O
. O

The O
old O
man O
hid O
them O
from O
the O
barber O
and O
weaved O
through O
the O
rows O
of O
showers O
, O
always O
covering O
them O
with O
one O
part O
of O
his O
body O
so O
they O
wouldn’t O
get O
wet O
. O

He O
promised O
half O
of O
his O
meager O
dinner O
to O
the O
greedy O
Stubendienst O
in O
exchange O
for O
hiding O
them O
during O
the O
roll O
call O
. O

Then O
, O
finally O
, O
he O
laid O
down O
with O
his O
violin O
on O
the O
cot O
, O
hugging O
it O
to O
him O
as O
he O
would O
a O
lover O
… O
It O
all O
unraveled O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Most O
people O
were O
already O
sleeping O
when O
the O
SSman O
from O
the O
baths O
burst O
in O
and O
shouted O
something O
in O
his O
native O
language O
that O
cannot O
be O
translated O
into O
any O
other O
cultured O
language O
: O
Der O
Saujud O
mit O
der O
Geige O
, O
her O
. O

Aber O
flott O
, O
flott O
. O

The O
old O
man O
got O
up O
from O
his O
bed O
and O
slowly O
walked O
out O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
in O
detail O
what O
happened O
after O
that O
. O

You O
could O
hear O
screaming O
from O
the O
Blockältester O
’s O
room O
, O
then O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
violin O
being O
played O
, O
then O
screams O
again O
, O
then O
a O
13-year O
- O
old O
Läufer O
, O
a O
seduced O
boy O
, O
ran O
naked O
out O
of O
the O
room O
and O
we O
could O
hear O
the O
drunk O
SSman O
singing O
. O

Then O
he O
shouted O
: O
SPIEL O
WENN O
'S O
JUDENBLUT O
VOM O
MESSER O
SPRITZT O
. O

When O
he O
got O
no O
response O
, O
he O
thundered O
: O
Play O
what O
I O
order O
you O
to O
play O
or O
you'll O
get O
what O
’s O
coming O
to O
you O
. O

We O
heard O
blows O
and O
screams O
… O
this O
went O
on O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
old O
Lithuanian B-LOC
Jew O
returned O
with O
a O
bump O
under O
his O
eye O
, O
scratches O
all O
over O
his O
face O
, O
and O
he O
walked O
slowly O
back O
to O
his O
cot O
, O
still O
holding O
the O
violin O
in O
his O
hands O
. O

He O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
cot O
and O
whispered O
: O
God O
has O
punished O
me O
. O

I O
ignored O
the O
call O
of O
the O
prophet O
. O

They O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
shores O
of O
Babylon O
and O
weeping O
, O
remembering O
Zion O
he O
wailed O
. O

I O
sang O
and O
played O
songs O
of O
joy O
in O
the O
land O
of O
strangers O
. O

The O
Lord O
God O
has O
punished O
me O
… O
He O
suddenly O
stood O
up O
and O
began O
to O
beat O
his O
violin O
against O
his O
cot O
with O
all O
his O
might O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
stop O
him O
, O
but O
he O
wouldn’t O
let O
us O
. O

He O
kept O
on O
breaking O
and O
beating O
it O
like O
a O
madman O
, O
wood O
against O
wood O
, O
until O
only O
a O
stump O
remained O
in O
his O
hand O
. O

With O
every O
blow O
, O
he O
swore O
: O
I’ll O
never O
, O
ever O
play O
again O
. O

Then O
he O
sank O
down O
on O
his O
cot O
and O
silently O
wept O
… O
I O
believe O
he O
was O
fated O
to O
uphold O
his O
oath O
. O

I O
last O
saw O
him O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Kaufering I-CAMP
, O
lying O
in O
the O
typhus O
block O
. O

The O
attending O
doctor O
, O
a O
Czech B-LOC
, O
had O
this O
to O
say O
about O
him O
: O
A O
strange O
man O
. O

He O
fantasizes O
whole O
movements O
of O
Mendelssohn O
’s O
violin O
concerto O
in O
his O
feverish O
state O
. O

Pointing O
to O
his O
head O
, O
he O
went O
on O
: O
you O
know O
, O
spotted O
typhus O
is O
an O
evil O
disease O
. O

I O
never O

him O
again O

The O

Commissioners O

drafted O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
provisions O
, O
and O
many O
of O
these O
Provisions O
are O
hardly O
published O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
regulations O
in O
question O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
access O
for O
the O
legation O
, O
and O
there O
may O
also O
be O
some O
minor O
differences O
in O
the O
rules O
at O
the O
various O
locations O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
the O
legation O
will O
refer O
to O
some O
of O
the O
special O
provisions O
applicable O
to O
the O
Jews O
of O
Ostland O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
foregoing O
, O
it O
is O
not O
certain O
that O
all O
the O
rules O
made O
under O
B. O
IV O
to O
VII O
apply O
throughout O
Ostland O
. O

However O
, O
the O
envoy O
has O
intended O
to O
refrain O
from O
conducting O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
they O
are O
applicable O
everywhere O
, O
as O
their O
applicability O
in O
most O
places O
is O
undoubted O
, O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
more O
the O
general O
principles O
which O
have O
been O
adopted O
by O
the O
authorities O

The O
following O
draws O
upon O
some O
of O
the O
Special O
Provisions O
of O
Interest O
. O

A. O
So O
far O
there O
is O
no O
provision O
for O
what O
is O
meant O
by O
the O
term O
' O
Jew O
' O
. O

However O
, O
one O
would O
assume O
that O
the O
rules O
of O
this O
term O
in O
Ostland O
, O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
ones O
used O
in O

from O

After O
3 O
weeks O
in O
this O
hell O
, O
we O
were O
transported O
again O
, O
this O
time O
to O
the O
labor O
camps O
in O
Čechovice B-LOC
in O
Silesia O
. O

The O
transport O
contained O
300 O
people O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
worked O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
clearing O
away O
the O
rubble O
after O
bombings O
. O

Housing O
was O
slightly O
better O
than O
in O
the O
other O
places O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
a O
former O
stable O
that O
had O
central O
heating O
pipes O
running O
through O
it O
. O

The O
work O
, O
besides O
the O
long O
working O
hours O
, O
was O
very O
hard O
, O
and O
there O
was O
very O
little O
food O
. O

We O
received O
1 O
soup O
, O
50 O
dkg O
of O
bread O
, O
and O
2 O
dkg O
of O
margarine O
a O
day O
. O

That O
was O
all O
. O

Clothing O
was O
threadbare O
, O
few O
people O
had O
shoes O
, O
and O
we O
worked O
outside O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
with O
no O
shoes O
on O
our O
feet O
. O

By O
coincidence O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
myself O
accepted O
as O
a O
stubendienst O
because O
I O
was O
young O
and O
I O
can O
say O
with O
certainty O
that O
this O
saved O
my O
life O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
entire O
transport O
of O
300 O
people O
, O
only O
14 O
survived O
and O
only O
those O
who O
worked O
at O
home O
. O

My O
father O
also O
died O
in O
Čechovice B-LOC
from O
pneumonia O
, O
as O
did O
so O
many O
others O
. O

The O
front O
was O
approaching O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-LOC
wanted O
to O
evacuate O
. O

And O
so O
they O
did O
. O

On O
January B-DATE
15th I-DATE
, O
they O
led O
us O
away O
from O
Čehovice B-LOC
and O
we O
walked O
for O
120 O
km O
. O

We O
made O
it O
to O
Loslau B-LOC
, O
also O
in O
Silesia O
, O
where O
we O
were O
loaded O
onto O
train O
cars O
and O
then O
we O
rode O
on O
. O

After O
5 O
days O
, O
we O
arrived O
in O
Gross B-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Rosen I-CAMP
. O

The O
journey O
was O
awful O
. O

120 O
of O
us O
were O
stuffed O
into O
1 O
car O
, O
they O
didn’t O
give O
us O
any O
food O
, O
and O
we O
stayed O
alive O
only O
because O
we O
begged O
or O
stole O
food O
from O
people O
at O
the O
train O
stations O
. O

In O
Gross B-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Rosen I-CAMP
, O
they O
brought O
us O
to O
a O
house O
where O
we O
slept O
on O
the O
bare O
earth O
since O
there O
was O
no O
floor O
. O

After O
4 O
days O
, O
they O
transported O
us O
to O
Buchenwalde B-CAMP
. O

Compared O
to O
the O
journey O
and O
the O
troubles O
we O
had O
already O
faced O
, O
we O
fared O
better O
here O
. O

After O
3 O
weeks O
, O
they O
transported O
us O
again O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
the O
convict O
Hermann B-PERS
- O
Göring B-PERS
-Werke O
commando O
in O
Halberstadt B-CAMP
. O

This O
was O
a O
convict O
camp O
for O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
Moabit O
prison O
, O
which O
was O
bombed O
, O
and O
when O
they O
ran O
out O
of O
convicts O
to O
add O
to O
the O
labor O
group O
of O
former O
thieves O
and O
murderers O
, O
who O
perished O
in O
high O
numbers O
here O
, O
they O
simply O
replenished O
it O
with O
Jews O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
a O
tunnel O
. O

We O
went O
to O
work O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
, O
there O
was O
no O
daylight O
in O
the O
tunnel O
, O
and O
we O
returned O
from O
work O
in O
the O
evening O
when O
it O
was O
dark O
once O
again O
. O

This O
was O
the O
hardest O
work O
ever O
. O

We O
were O
hungry O
and O
freezing O
. O

We O
didn’t O
see O
any O
light O
for O
2 O
months O
. O

Due O
to O
my O
youth O
I O
was O
again O
able O
to O
get O
easier O
work O
. O

I O
tricked O
the O
Steiger O
by O
denying O
that O
I O
was O
Jewish O
and O
so O
I O
was O
given O
lighter O
work O
, O
during O
which O
I O
was O
able O
to O
observe O
the O
work O
in O
the O
tunnel O
. O

The O
work O
was O
closely O
monitored O
. O

If O
someone O
was O
too O
weak O
or O
tired O
to O
continue O
, O
they O
were O
thrown O
into O
a O
barrel O
of O
water O
and O
left O
there O
until O
they O
drowned O
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
they O
had O
committed O
sabotage O
and O
that O
sabotage O
had O
to O
be O
punished O
. O

After O
several O
hours O
, O
the O
barrel O
was O
loaded O
onto O
a O
cart O
with O
rocks O
and O
dumped O
together O
with O
the O
rocks O
into O
an O
embankment O
, O
which O
was O
then O
flattened O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
people O
were O
buried O
here O
. O

I O
was O
the O
only O
one O
from O
our O
transport O
to O
survive O
. O

They O
evacuated O
us O
further O
away O
ahead O
of O
the O
approaching O
front O
, O
and O
the O
former O
convicts O
and O
I O
, O
the O
only O
one O
from O
our O
transport O
, O
made O
it O
to O
Magdeburg B-CAMP
, O
where O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
search O
for O
unexploded O
bombs O
after O
air O
strikes O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
we O
were O
soon O
moved O
, O
and O
in O
Belzig B-CAMP
, O
which O
was O
our O
next O
stop O
, O
we O
were O
liberated O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
my O
troubles O
, O
I O
became O
a O
so O
- O
called O
Muselmann O
. O

After O
liberation O
, O
I O
became O
ill O
and O
spent O
several O
months O
in O
a O
hospital O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
returned O
to O
Prague B-LOC
nobody O
imagined O
that O
I O
could O
have O
survived O

I O
do O

Re O
: O
Concentration O

Jews O
. O

I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
inform O
that O
an O
important O
decree O
concerning O
the O
transfer O
of O
Jews O
to O
a O
location O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
( O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
) O
has O
been O
published O
in O
the O
Collection O
of O
Laws O
and O
Decrees O
of O
the O
Reichsprotektor O
. O

With O
this O
measure O
the O
Jewish O
element O
will O
be O
definitively O
isolated O
from O
the O
remaining O
Aryan O
population O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
will O
have O
to O
be O
vacated O
by O
Aryan O
citizens O
. O

The O
Reichsprotektor O
’s O
decree O
deals O
with O
this O
problem O
and O
rules O
that O
no O
Aryan O
person O
transferred O
elsewhere O
shall O
suffer O
any O
material O
loss O
. O

All O
Aryans O
living O
in O
the O
area O
chosen O
for O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
’s I-LOC
Jewish O
ghetto O
will O
have O
their O
losses O
refunded O
and O
will O
be O
transferred O
elsewhere O
in O
an O
appropriate O
manner O
. O

Clearly O
, O
despite O
this O
measure O
, O
those O
who O
are O
to O
be O
transferred O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
some O
sacrifices O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

The O
local O
press O
emphasizes O
that O
these O
sacrifices O
will O
in O
any O
case O
be O
largely O
offset O
by O
the O
huge O
advantages O
that O
cleansing O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
of O
Jews O
will O
provide O

the O
entire O

Report O
on O
the O
Ebensee B-CAMP
Concentration O
Camp O
In O
the O
most O
beautiful O
Austrian B-LOC
countryside O
, O
in O
the O
salt O
cave O
, O
on O
the O
southern O
edge O
of O
Lake O
Traun O
, O
lies O
the O
industrial O
small O
town O
of O
Ebensee B-CAMP
. O

Several O
hundred O
meters O
from O
the O
town O
, O
on O
a O
steep O
slope O
, O
there O
are O
several O
building O
complexes O
with O
the O
typical O
architecture O
of O
concentration O
camps O
. O

The O
camp O
was O
founded O
in O
1942 B-DATE
and O
was O
originally O
designed O
to O
hold O
roughly O
2,000 O
people O
. O

Later O
, O
however O
, O
thousands O
of O
prisoners O
from O
evacuated O
camps O
from O
all O
over O
Germany B-LOC
were O
transported O
to O
Ebensee B-CAMP
, O
and O
so O
the O
average O
number O
of O
people O
here O
was O
around O
20,000 O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
4 O
, O
even O
5 O
, O
people O
shared O
an O
80 O
cm O
wide O
plank O
- O
bed O
. O

Ebensee B-CAMP
wasn’t O
a O
Vernichtungslager O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
people O
weren’t O
executed O
or O
gassed O
en O
masse O
here O
, O
but O
were O
beaten O
to O
death O
by O
the O
hundreds O
every O
day O
while O
they O
worked O
or O
were O
on O
the O
block O
. O

Combined O
with O
other O
circumstances O
, O
the O
toil O
here O
could O
not O
be O
endured O
for O
more O
than O
4 O
to O
6 O
weeks O
. O

The O
18,000 O
surviving O
prisoners O
were O
either O
only O
here O
for O
a O
very O
short O
time O
, O
or O
had O
a O
better O
position O
within O
the O
camp O
system O
. O

But O
roughly O
1,500 O
of O
the O
liberated O
prisoners O
died O
from O
various O
diseases O
and O
as O
a O
result O
of O
their O
bad O
treatment O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

They O
were O
buried O
in O
a O
cemetery O
that O
was O
renovated O
with O
dignity O
near O
the O
road O
between O
Ebensee B-CAMP
and O
Bad B-CAMP
Ischl I-CAMP
. O

In O
it O
, O
there O
are O
rows O
of O
red O
crosses O
, O
which O
alternate O
with O
wooden O
Jewish O
stars O
. O

We O
worked O
almost O
the O
whole O
time O
in O
underground O
tunnels O
. O

Paths O
were O
created O
within O
the O
cliffs O
, O
some O
over O
a O
kilometer O
in O
length O
, O
that O
were O
interconnected O
and O
made O
up O
an O
enormous O
system O
of O
underground O
tunnels O
and O
rooms O
. O

We O
manufactured O
synthetic O
gasoline O
, O
which O
is O
still O
manufactured O
here O
today O
, O
and O
a O
weapons O
plant O
of O
the O
Hermann B-PERS
- I-PERS
Göring I-PERS
-Werke O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
located O
here O
, O
but O
this O
never O
happened O
because O
of O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
. O

The O
work O
was O
extremely O
difficult O
. O

Today O
, O
SS O
men O
who O
live O
in O
the O
former O
concentration O
camp O
work O
in O
the O
synthetic O
gasoline O
factory O
. O

It O
is O
a O
strange O
sight O
to O
see O
the O
camp O
guarded O
by O
American B-ORG
troops I-ORG
, O
an O
American B-ORG
soldier O
on O
the O
guard O
tower O
, O
and O
the O
English B-LOC
- O
German B-LOC
sign O
electrified O
fence O
– O
elektrischer O
Zaun O
. O

But O
we O
also O
see O
that O
the O
interned O
SSmen O
don’t O
work O
too O
hard O
, O
and O
hear O
that O
they O
are O
allowed O
to O
receive O
packages O
, O
and O
that O
their O
food O
isn’t O
worse O
than O
the O
food O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
nearby O
camp O
, O
in O
the O
former O
SS O
barracks O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
crematorium O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
and O
during O
a O
period O
of O
high O
mortality O
it O
couldn’t O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
burning O
of O
all O
of O
the O
dead O
bodies O
, O
and O
so O
there O
was O
a O
mass O
grave O
of O
several O
thousand O
murdered O
people O
next O
to O
it O
. O

There O
was O
apparently O
a O
gas O
chamber O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
but O
we O
never O
found O
out O
if O
it O
was O
ever O
used O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
Schonungsblocks O
were O
a O
special O
sort O
of O
hell O
. O

The O
sick O
lay O
there O
naked O
on O
the O
bare O
ground O
, O
what O
little O
food O
they O
were O
to O
get O
was O
stolen O
by O
block O
leaders O
, O
and O
therefore O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
Schonungsblock O
was O
like O
a O
death O
sentence O
. O

Besides O
the O
former O
prisoners O
, O
400 O
Poles B-LOC
, O
about O
200 O
of O
which O
are O
Jews O
, O
are O
housed O
in O
the O
nearby O
camp O
( O
the O
former O
SS O
barracks O
) O
. O

Their O
living O
conditions O
are O
not O
satisfactory O
. O

Their O
accommodations O
are O
adequate O
, O
but O
they O
complain O
about O
their O
small O
food O
rations O
and O
that O
nobody O
cares O
about O
their O
clothes O
. O

They O
are O
therefore O
forced O
to O
procure O
necessities O
by O
trading O
. O

This O
angers O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
and O
American B-LOC
authorities O
, O
which O
makes O
their O
situation O
worse O
, O
and O
that O
only O
increases O
their O
poverty O
, O
and O
thus O
they O
have O
to O
trade O
. O

They O
also O
complain O
about O
not O
getting O
enough O
help O
from O
Jewish O
institutions O
, O
and O
have O
stated O
that O
they O
have O
even O
been O
robbed O
and O
cheated O
by O
them O
. O

They O
live O
alongside O
the O
Aryan O
Poles B-LOC
in O
the O
camp O
in O
a O
tense O
atmosphere O
. O

What O
we O
enjoyed O
most O
in O
the O
camp O
was O
the O
practically O
exemplary O
solidarity O
and O
brotherly O
mutual O
help O
between O
Jewish O
men O
and O
women O
. O

A O
trip O
trough O
Austria B-LOC
reveals O
that O
this O
country O
was O
full O
of O
concentration O
camps O
, O
and O
there O
is O
barely O
a O
town O
without O
a O
monstrous O
double O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
nearby O
. O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
former O
prisoners O
in O
this O
country O
is O
worse O
than O
in O
Germany B-LOC
because O
the O
Austrians B-LOC
, O
as O
citizens O
of O
a O
free O
country O
, O
have O
refused O
to O
take O
responsibility O
for O
Nazi O
crimes O
and O
so O
the O
elevated O
position O
of O
the O
prisoners O
in O
Germany B-LOC
is O
not O
the O
same O
here O
. O

In O
the O
Russian B-LOC
sector O
there O
is O
an O
obvious O
tendency O
to O
repatriate O
as O
fast O
as O
possible O
, O
even O
people O
who O
don’t O
want O
to O
return O
to O
their O
home O
country O

the O

in O
the O
manner O
I O

It O
was O

Not O

did O
they O
confiscate O

which O
they O
never O

liked O

they O
didn’t O
save O

feasted O

in O

destroyed O

When O

tried O

with O
our O
Jewish O

notify O
the O
SS O

answered O

Only O
a O

were O

One O
or O
maybe O
more O

so O
many O
things O
that O
, O
during O
a O
search O
by O
Germans B-LOC

they O

As O
far O
as O
I O

one O

We O

We O
found O
out O
that O
one O

When O

full O
Jews O
left O
Prague B-LOC

July B-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
we O
3 O
chaverim O
of O
the O
youth O
movement O
stayed O
behind O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
our O
task O
was O
to O
help O
with O
parcels O
and O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
to O
remain O
in O
written O
contact O
with O
the O
evacuees O
and O
with O
the O
movement O
abroad O
. O

The O
correspondence O
was O
handled O
by O
Heinz B-PERS
Prossnitz I-PERS
until O
his O
departure O
in O
October B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
as O
he O
usually O
did O
by O
far O
the O
largest O
part O
of O
the O
work O
with O
uncomparable O
dedication O
and O
self O
- O
sacrifice O
. O

The O
main O
purpose O
of O
the O
correspondence O
was O
to O
carefully O
write O
to O
as O
many O
addresses O
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
as O
possible O
, O
to O
which O
parcels O
were O
sent O
from O
there O
. O

Soon O
after O
the O
transport O
’ O
s O
departure O
, O
the O
previously O
unrestricted O
parcel O
traffic O
with O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
lifted O
and O
the O
first O
registration O
stamps O
for O
20 O
kg O
parcels O
arrived O
. O

Since O
the O
correct O
sender O
had O
to O
be O
listed O
, O
we O
were O
afraid O
that O
we O
could O
be O
punished O
because O
of O
the O
many O
things O
we O
bought O
unofficially O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
many O
stamps O
were O
sent O
to O
our O
addresses O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
look O
for O
people O
in O
T B-GHETTO
. O

to O
whose O
name O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
send O
stamps O
. O

How O
could O
any O
of O
us O
have O
been O
explained O
having O
about O
150 O
kg O
of O
food O
a O
month O
, O
when O
a O
Jew O
did O
not O
even O
have O
enough O
to O
eat O
on O
his O
own O
? O
But O
strangely O
, O
the O
Germans O
had O
no O
interest O
in O
such O
obvious O
transgressions O
. O

But O
after O
all O
, O
they O
did O
not O
need O
a O
reason O
to O
lock O
us O
up O
. O

Now O
the O
restriction O
on O
approval O
stamps O
applied O
only O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
, O
one O
could O
continue O
to O
send O
things O
freely O
from O
the O
Reich O
. O

So O
we O
looked O
for O
people O
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
and O
in O
the O
Reich O
, O
to O
whom O
we O
sent O
ready O
- O
made O
packets O
to O
forward O
on O
. O

Also O
, O
Noemi B-PERS
, O
who O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
star O
, O
obtained O
an O
entry O
pass O
and O
even O
drove O
a O
few O
car O
boots O
full O
of O
parcels O
into O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
. O

In O
about O
January B-DATE
, I-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
the O
first O
news O
came O
from O
Birkenau B-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Auschwitz I-CAMP
, O
also O
requesting O
parcels O
. O

Only O
food O
that O
was O
ready O
to O
eat O
was O
suitable O
, O
we O
mostly O
sent O
bread O
. O

Very O
few O
messages O
came O
through O
, O
and O
those O
that O
did O
were O
wildly O
contradictory O
, O
so O
we O
were O
always O
in O
the O
dark O
as O
to O
whether O
they O
got O
the O
parcels O
at O
all O
and O
what O
they O
got O
, O
which O
of O
course O
created O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
. O

Today O
I O
believe O
that O
only O
a O
small O
part O
actually O
arrived O
. O

And O
then O
around O
May O
the O
first O
news O
about O
the O
gassings O
came O
via O
English B-LOC
radio O
, O
so O
again O
, O
we O
did O
even O
not O
know O
who O
was O
still O
alive O
. O

Then O
, O
no O
more O
news O
came O
from O
there O
. O

Around O
July O
information O
arrived O
from O
many O
sides O
that O
the O
postal O
service O
with O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
was O
longer O
working O
and O
so O
we O
stopped O
the O
shipments O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

Now O
for O
something O
about O
our O
difficulties O
. O

First O
, O
there O
was O
the O
food O
supply O
. O

We O
had O
quite O
a O
few O
so O
- O
called O
smugglers O
who O
supplied O
us O
with O
food O
, O
but O
it O
was O
never O
enough O
. O

And O
if O
there O
was O
some O
flour O
somewhere O
, O
then O
there O
was O
no O
fat O
to O
be O
had O
, O
or O
jam O
. O

Once O
we O
were O
flooded O
with O
legumes O
and O
a O
month O
later O
there O
were O
none O
at O
all O
. O

So O
we O
always O
had O
to O
ask O
and O
beg O
from O
one O
smuggler O
to O
another O
, O
and O
we O
were O
put O
off O
until O
the O
next O
day O
, O
when O
once O
again O
there O
was O
still O
nothing O
there O
for O
some O
reason O
. O

And O
so O
most O
of O
our O
time O
was O
lost O
on O
errands O
. O

We O
couldn't O
take O
large O
quantities O
home O
either O
; O
our O
families O
were O
too O
afraid O
and O
not O
without O
cause O
. O

The O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
were O
too O
afraid O
to O
let O
us O
use O
a O
room O
there O
. O

Often O
, O
therefore O
, O
we O
had O
to O
postpone O
parcels O
, O
and O
sometimes O
couldn’t O
send O
them O
at O
all O
, O
because O
we O
lacked O
the O
most O
necessary O
food O
to O
put O
in O
them O
. O

The O
second O
crucial O
difficulty O
was O
the O
money O
supply O
, O
my O
special O
task O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
there O
was O
still O
money O
left O
over O
that O
our O
departing O
Chaverim O
had O
gotten O
from O
abroad O
. O

But O
when O
that O
ran O
out O
, O
the O
ordeal O
began O
for O
the O
remaining O
3 O
Zionists O
. O

They O
still O
had O
Zionist O
money O
, O
but O
each O
one O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
next O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
last O
reserves O
were O
with O
our O
Jewish O
elder O
and O
known O
Zionist O
, O
František B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
. O

A O
grubby O
financier O
, O
one O
had O
to O
use O
cunning O
to O
pull O
even O
a O
crown O
from O
his O
purse O
. O

It O
cost O
me O
many O
difficult O
and O
often O
unsuccessful O
attempts O
, O
for O
which O
I O
had O
employ O
all O
the O
diplomatic O
arts O
I O
could O
muster O
. O

I O
had O
to O
remind O
him O
and O
repeatedly O
awaken O
his O
empathy O
for O
the O
hungry O
, O
to O
convince O
him O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
parcels O
, O
in O
order O
to O
extract O
K O
3,000 O
from O
him O
if O
I O
was O
lucky O
. O

And O
even O
that O
was O
a O
success O
, O
because O
when O
the O
other O
two O
Zionists O
had O
asked O
him O
for O
money O
, O
they O
were O
immediately O
sent O
away O
with O
the O
assurance O
that O
he O
had O
absolutely O
nothing O
at O
present O
. O

But O
what O
K O
3,000 O
, O
- O
were O
worth O
, O
in O
the O
best O
case O
2 O
times O
in O
3 O
weeks O
, O
can O
be O
measured O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
1 O
kg O
fat O
cost O
K O
1500- O
, O
margarine O
from O
K O
500- O
to O
K O
1000- O
, O
and O
lately O
jam O
K O
150 O
, O
- O
, O
sugar O
K O
300 O
, O
- O
1 O
kg O
. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
save O
and O
save O
, O
send O
inferior O
food O
and O
fewer O
parcels O
, O
and O
those O
that O
we O
did O
send O
were O
often O
very O
sad O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
get O
money O
in O
other O
ways O
, O
by O
selling O
books O
from O
the O
Zion O
. O

Library O
and O
KKL B-ORG
stamps O
, O
but O
those O
were O
all O
drops O
in O
the O
bucket O
. O

Money O
was O
our O
eternal O
problem O
and O
grief O
, O
because O
without O
it O
we O
could O
not O
always O
fully O
exploit O
the O
opportunity O
to O
help O
. O

We O
only O
sent O
this O
money O
to O
certain O
Machsan O
addresses O
at O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
and O
in O
other O
places O
where O
there O
was O
no O
Machsan O
, O
to O
every O
Zionist O
who O
was O
in O
our O
directory O
. O

One O
more O
difficulty O
, O
but O
thank O
God O
we O
got O
over O
it O
, O
was O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
whole O
affair O
at O
every O
turn O
. O

Jews O
’ O
bags O
would O
sometimes O
be O
searched O
. O

We O
carried O
forbidden O
foods O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
and O
usually O
in O
noticeably O
large O
quantities O
such O
as O
20 O
kg O
of O
flour O
, O
a O
large O
bucket O
of O
jam O
, O
legumes O
. O

Negotiating O
in O
the O
shops O
, O
our O
whole O
relationship O
with O
the O
smugglers O
, O
was O
dangerous O
and O
it O
is O
our O
luck O
that O
none O
of O
them O
was O
ever O
caught O
. O

Then O
Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
send O
letters O
abroad O
or O
parcels O
to O
the O
Reich O
, O
could O
not O
enter O
the O
post O
office O
, O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
shop O
from O
3 O
- O
5 O
pm O
and O
of O
course O
that O
was O
not O
always O
possible O
. O

We O
had O
to O
cover O
the O
star O
though O
even O
the O
starless O
ones O
who O
were O
packing O
the O
parcels O
with O
us O
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
already O
known O
in O
the O
surrounding O
area O
and O
the O
various O
post O
offices O
, O
due O
to O
the O
large O
quantities O
that O
we O
sent O
regularly O
. O

In O
August B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
a O
camp O
for O
all O
the O
Jewish O
parts O
of O
mixed O
marriages O
from O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
was O
established O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Since O
I O
worked O
there O
, O
I O
also O
supplied O
them O
with O
food O
as O
best O
I O
could O
. O

The O
attitude O
of O
these O
so O
- O
called O
aryan O
clan O
Jews O
to O
Judaism O
was O
interesting O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
focused O
on O
assimilation O
, O
as O
far O
as O
they O
thought O
about O
it O
at O
all O
and O
especially O
with O
the O
women O
, O
it O
was O
already O
at O
a O
very O
advanced O
stage O
. O

The O
best O
proof O
of O
how O
lost O
they O
are O
to O
Judaism O
came O
at O
Christmas O
, O
which O
of O
course O
was O
celebrated O
. O

With O
fun O
by O
those O
with O
lighter O
natures O
and O
with O
tears O
about O
the O
separation O
from O
family O
, O
for O
the O
more O
serious O
ones O
. O

You O
could O
see O
that O
the O
deeper O
relationship O
to O
the O
holiday O
was O
missing O
- O
they O
could O
not O
really O
find O
the O
right O
form O
in O
which O
to O
celebrate O
- O
but O
you O
could O
see O
what O
an O
impact O
family O
and O
habits O
had O
had O
. O

And O
yet O
, O
when O
they O
came O
back O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
many O
of O
these O
women O
told O
me O
that O
they O
had O
connected O
this O
time O
and O
their O
experiences O
with O
the O
Jews O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
advantage O
for O
these O
people O
, O
as O
it O
means O
alienation O
from O
their O
own O
family O
, O
but O
that O
is O
how O
our O
typical O
Jewish O
destiny O
has O
left O
its O
mark O
even O
on O
the O
apostates O
. O

Now O
to O
the O
parcel O
actions O
. O

In O
the O
autumn O
some O
news O
came O
from O
girls O
from O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
from O
boys O
from O
Schwarzheide B-CAMP
, O
to O
whom O
we O
could O
send O
things O
. O

There O
was O
also O
an O
action O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
which O
sent O
large O
quantities O
of O
food O
and O
clothing O
to O
Schwarzheide B-CAMP
, O
which O
was O
even O
approved O
by O
the O
Central B-ORG
Offices I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Issues I-ORG
. O

Then O
the O
transports O
left O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
the O
Machsan O
parcels O
ceased O
almost O
completely O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
took O
away O
the O
last O
full O
Jews O
, O
who O
were O
previously O
indispensable O
to O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
including O
Heinz B-PERS
Prossnitz I-PERS
. O

With O
him O
, O
who O
died O
in O
the O
gas O
a O
few O
days O
later O
, O
we O
lost O
our O
main O
initiator O
, O
the O
best O
comrade O
, O
the O
most O
helpful O
and O
selfless O
man O
I O
have O
ever O
met O
in O
my O
life O
. O

On O
the O
day O
before O
Prossnitz B-PERS
’s I-PERS
departure O
, O
in O
the O
to O
- O
do O
surrounding O
the O
packages O
, O
two O
Swiss B-LOC
sent O
by O
the O
Geneva B-LOC
Hechaluz B-ORG
appeared O
with O
20.000 O
, O
- O
Dollars O
. O

But O
, O
in O
his O
excitement O
, O
Mr O
. O

Prossnitz B-PERS
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
it O
and O
sent O
the O
money O
back O
. O

After O
his O
departure O
Noemi B-PERS
and O
I O
felt O
very O
sorry O
about O
that O
, O
because O
we O
needed O
it O
very O
much O
and O
so O
we O
wrote O
to O
Switzerland B-LOC
, O
of O
course O
camouflaged O
as O
family O
stories O
. O

2 O
months O
later O
, O
a O
Czech B-LOC
appeared O
with O
20,000 O
francs O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
we O
did O
not O
have O
much O
opportunity O
to O
send O
parcels O
with O
the O
money O
, O
because O
one O
month O
later O
the O
postal O
traffic O
to O
the O
Reich O
was O
discontinued O
. O

That O
was O
the O
end O
of O
our O
work O
. O

But O
we O
already O
saw O
new O
uses O
for O
the O
money O
. O

On O
February O
4 O
, O
the O
first O
Chaverah O
, O
who O
had O
escaped O
from O
the O
Russians B-LOC
when O
she O
changed O
camps O
, O
came O
to O
see O
me O
. O

Skin O
and O
bones O
, O
with O
short O
, O
louse O
- O
ridden O
hair O
stubble O
, O
sick O
feet O
and O
some O
rags O
, O
she O
passed O
herself O
off O
as O
a O
refugee O
German O
, O
was O
given O
some O
dresses O
by O
the O
German O
aid O
organization O
and O
had O
them O
sent O
to O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Since O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
us O
to O
accommodate O
her O
, O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
train O
station O
the O
next O
day O
, O
recovered O
in O
a O
German O
hospital O
for O
six O
weeks O
and O
was O
then O
sent O
to O
a O
Czech B-LOC
village O
where O
she O
lived O
in O
her O
role O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
. O

With O
her O
we O
got O
the O
first O
authentic O
news O
about O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
the O
hells O
of O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
labour O
camp O
, O
the O
death O
marches O
on O
the O
run O
from O
the O
enemy O
. O

Then O
we O
became O
aware O
of O
how O
powerless O
we O
had O
been O
with O
our O
few O
parcels O
against O
this O
decisive O
will O
to O
exterminate O
. O

Only O
very O
, O
very O
few O
lives O
could O
be O
saved O
despite O
the O
goodwill O
of O
all O
those O
who O
helped O
us O
from O
abroad O
with O
money O
and O
parcels O
and O
from O
the O
Reich O
with O
parcel O
brokering O
. O

But O
maybe O
we O
were O
able O
to O
give O
people O
a O
little O
joy O
for O
the O
last O
time O
in O
their O
lives O
with O
them O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
give O
approximate O
statistics O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
knowledge O
and O
belief O
. O

The O

Given O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
were O
only O
3 O
people O
, O
who O
worked O
all O
day O

and O
because O
of O
the O
shortages O

, O
the O
quantities O
are O
ridiculously O
small O
compared O
to O
what O

But O
thank O
God O
we O
were O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
tried O
to O
help O
, O
most O
of O
the O
Jews O
who O
stayed O
behind O
who O
weren’t O
sent O
away O
until O
the O
last O
few O

and O
their O
non O

Jewish O
spouses O
helped O
in O
their O

as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
. O

And O
as O
the O
Chaverim O
always O
wrote O
us O
, O
a O
parcel O
meant O
not O
just O
material O
help O
, O
but O
also O
spiritual O
. O

We O
felt O
that O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
too O
, O
when O
a O
letter O
, O
once O
a O
packet O
and O
then O
the O
money O
came O
: O
We O
are O
not O
completely O
abandoned O
, O
not O
all O
of O
humanity O
hates O
us O
, O
but O
our O
people O
still O
live O
on O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
they O
feel O
with O
us O
and O
will O
help O
us O
wherever O
they O
can O
. O

And O
much O
, O
much O
more O
help O
is O
needed O
until O
we O
are O
saved O
from O
our O
eternal O
Jewish O
destiny O

, O
while O
troops O
were O
blocking O
the O
streets O

Skopje B-LOC

groups O
of O

began O
to O
knock O
at O

the O
homes O

asking O
them O

5,000 O

The O
lengthy O
examination O

will O
be O

deportation O

It O
has O
been O
a O
blanket O
action O
both O
as O
regards O
people O
and O
as O
regards O
property O
: O
even O
Jews O
of O
extremely O
advanced O
age O
or O
with O
a O
serious O
health O
condition O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
leave O
their O
homes O

were O
taken O
to O
the O
camp O
on O
rough O
carts O
, O
while O
their O
homes O
with O
all O
their O
contents O
were O
declared O
State O
property O
and O
even O
what O
little O
they O
had O
been O
allowed O
to O
take O
with O
them O

later O
further O
restricted O

They O

with O
only O
the O
oldest O
garment O
and O
the O
oldest O
shoes O
they O
had O
brought O
with O

, O
and O
the O
search O
for O
gold O
and O
money O
about O
the O
persons O
of O
the O
concentrated O
people O
has O
enabled O
officials O

soldiers O
to O
walk O
off O

all O
they O
could O
still O
lay O
their O

used O
toothbrushes O
and O
almost O
empty O
tubes O

have O
been O
taken O

unfortunate O

may O
truly O
be O
said O
to O

with O
only O
their O
eyes O

Added O
to O
the O
worries O
about O
their O
entirely O
uncertain O
future O
and O
to O
the O
pain O
for O
the O
total O
loss O
of O
all O
property O
, O
the O
9,000 O
people O
about O
to O
be O
deported O
face O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
hardships O
that O
are O
inflicted O
on O
them O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
foresight O
or O
to O
mere O
brutality O
. O

The O
most O
basic O
sanitary O
facilities O
, O
which O
at O
first O
were O
lacking O
almost O
entirely O
, O
are O
only O
now O
beginning O
to O
work O
but O
still O
only O
inadequately O
, O
food O
is O
very O
scarce O
and O
unsuitable O
( O
during O
the O
first O
days O
they O
gave O
out O
, O
even O
to O
babies O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
some O
thin O
bean O
slops O
without O
any O
bread O
) O
, O
the O
guards O
seize O
on O
any O
pretext O
to O
use O
with O
sadistic O
force O
the O
whips O
they O
carry O
, O
while O
the O
crowding O
of O
all O
sorts O
of O
people O
within O
a O
cramped O
space O
renders O
rest O
all O
but O
impossible O
. O

The O
tragic O
but O
logical O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
are O
suicides O
– O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
at O
least O
three O
so O
far O
– O
and O
, O
particularly O
among O
women O
, O
instances O
of O
hysterical O
agitation O
bordering O
on O
insanity O
. O

According O
to O
what O
Bulgarians B-ORG
are O
saying O
, O
the O
total O
elimination O
of O
Israelite O
from O
Macedonia B-LOC
has O
been O
requested O
by O
Germany B-LOC
for O
military O
reasons O
: O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
have O
made O
excellent O
, O
huge O
gains O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
that O
in O
carrying O
it O
out O
the O
have O
displayed O
the O
most O
total O
disregard O
for O
even O
the O
most O
basic O
humanitarian O
principles O
. O

I O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
claim O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
people O
who O
, O
being O
present O
in O
Skopje B-LOC

the O
manner O

taken O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
and O
having O
then O
heard O
how O
they O
were O
being O
treated O

have O
not O
felt O
a O
sense O
of O
pity O

those O
thus O

of O
deep O
condemnation O

Measures O

the O
Jews O

- O
The O
new O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
that O
had O
been O
announced O
have O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
seen O
a O
drastic O
implementation O
. O

Ten O
thousand O
Jews O
in O
towns O
and O
in O
villages O
had O
received O
personal O
summonses O
in O
order O
to O
be O
assembled O
in O
concentration O
camps O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
one O
may O
convert O
to O
the O
evangelical O
Church O
and O
because O
many O
of O
those O
summoned O
were O
aware O
that O
public O
opinion O
was O
mostly O
opposed O
to O
the O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
campaign O
, O
and O
also O
because O
rumour O
had O
it O
that O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
Monsignor O
Tiso B-PERS
, O
was O
indirectly O
opposed O
to O
such O
methods O
of O
persecution O
, O
many O
Jews O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
orders O
given O
by O
Minister B-PERS
Mach I-PERS
. O

So O
in O
the O
night O
from O
23rd O
to O
24th O
March O
patrols O
formed O
by O
police O
and O
Guardsmen O
who O
had O
been O
joined O
by O
SS O
men O
arrived O
from O
over O
the O
nearby O
border O
, O
entered O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
seized O
three O
thousand O
women O
aged O
18 O
to O
35 O
years O
, O
and O
carried O
them O
swiftly O
on O
a O
lorry O
to O
the O
munitions O
factory O
in O
Bratislava O
and O
to O
the O
internment O
areas O

Žilina B-LOC

Prešov B-LOC

etc O
. O

The O
Authorities O
closest O
to O
the O
President O
are O
denying O
or O
trying O
to O
downplay O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
events O

have O
clearly O
shaken O
the O
public O

Hlinka B-ORG

who O
is O

elements O

others O

oppose O
the O
President O

accuses O
the O
Jews O
themselves O

being O
responsible O

everything O

deserving O

the O
worst O
punishments O

It O

The O
announcement O
of O
harsher O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
measures O
had O
already O
prompted O
the O
Holy O
See O
to O
deliver O
a O
note O
to O
the O
Minister O
of O
Slovakia O
, O
Mister O
Sidor O
; O
the O
persecutions O
that O
have O
since O
taken O
place O
have O
then O
given O
rise O
to O
repeated O
démarches O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Apostolic O

Monsignor O

with O
Prime O
Minister O
Tuka B-PERS

As O
things O
now O
stand O
, O
the O
events O
described O
above O
have O
caused O
a O
rift O
not O
yet O
made O
public O

dangerous O
between O
Prime O
Minister O
Tuka B-PERS
and O
Minister B-PERS
Mach I-PERS
on O
the O
one O
side O
and O
President O
Tiso B-PERS
on O
the O
other O
. O

The O
consequences O
are O
easy O
to O
predict O
if O
the O
anti O

Semitic O
persecution O
should O
continue O
in O
the O
manner O
reported O
above O

stopped O
by O

get O
a O

for O
my O
request O
for O
the O
allocation O
of O
an O
apartment O

Two O
women O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
office O
, O
and O
so O
I O
had O
to O
wait O

I O
unwittingly O
overheard O
a O
conversation O
between O
two O
female O
clerks O
and O
one O
man O
, O
in O
which O
they O
called O
Jews O
an O
unproductive O
element O
, O
like O
profiteers O
, O
living O
off O
of O
and O
abusing O
benefits O
twice O
as O
often O
as O
other O
political O
prisoners O
, O
because O
they O
also O
receive O
benefits O
from O
their O
religious O
community O
and O
if O
there O
were O
any O
other O
organizations O
, O
then O
they O
would O
try O
and O
receive O
benefits O
from O
these O
as O
well O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
returned O
, O
but O
I O
don’t O
pity O
them O
in O
the O
least O
. O

In O
the O
concentration O
camps O
, O
all O
they O
did O
was O
receive O
rations O
. O

They O
have O
an O
aversion O
to O
work O
, O
for O
you O
can’t O
see O
any O
of O
them O
sweeping O
the O

they O

another O

What O
will O
they O

us O

what O

His O
speech O

He O
explains O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
drawn O

out O
process O
and O
explains O
the O
plans O
to O
go O
forward O
, O
but O
then O
concludes O
: O
The O
atmosphere O
that O
could O
make O
us O
aware O
of O
these O
facts O
, O
this O
atmosphere O
of O
uncertainty O
and O
doubt O
must O
not O
affect O
this O
camp O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
of O
this O
camp O
must O
be O
all O
about O
preparing O
tsionit O
and O
aliyah O
. O

Preparations O
for O
tsionit O
anywhere O
and O
under O
any O
conditions O
and O
for O
aliyah O
wherever O
and O
however O
, O
for O
you O
must O
know O
— O
I O
don’t O
see O
you O
as O
small O
children O
and O
so O
I O
cannot O
hide O
it O
from O
you O
— O
that O
we O
don’t O
know O
what O
we O
will O
have O
to O
face O
in O
the O
near O
future O
or O
what O
tasks O
will O
be O
required O
of O
us O
, O
and O
into O
what O
trouble O
this O
broken O
, O
unprepared O
Jewry O
of O
the O
Protectorate O
will O
be O
placed O
. O

Let O
us O
not O
delude O
ourselves O
. O

We O
are O
in O
a O
trap O
from O
which O
there O
is O
no O
escape O
, O
and O
we O
will O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
ourselves O
and O
ourselves O
alone O
. O

Be O
aware O
that O
the O
next O
aliyah O
will O
happen O
only O
after O
the O
great O
suffering O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
will O
help O
you O
become O
aware O

Therefore O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
hear O
that O
the O

The O
evening O
before O
wearing O
the O
Jewish O
star O
was O
made O
mandatory O
. O

A O
small O
circle O
of O
Jewish O
functionaries O
met O
. O

They O
were O
members O
of O
the O
G.A. O
and O
representatives O
of O
the O
youth O
movement O
. O

Doctor O
Kahn B-PERS
spoke O
about O
the O
concept O
of O
Jewish O
honor O
: O
The O
yellow O
star O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
shame O
( O
Schandfleck O
) O
, O
but O
this O
sign O
of O
shame O
temporarily O
affixed O
over O
our O
hearts O
will O
remain O
a O
sign O
of O
shame O
eternally O
affixed O
over O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
German O
nation O
. O

When O
the O
Jew O
will O
be O
proud O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
time O
he O
wore O
this O
sign O
, O
the O
German O
will O
scream O
at O
the O
world O
until O
he O
is O
red O
in O
the O
face O
. O

He O
then O
ended O
with O
the O
words O
: O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
speak O
about O
Jewish O
honor O
here O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
tell O
you O
this O
: O
tomorrow O
’s O
honor O
will O
be O
to O
settle O
the O
Jewish O
question O
once O
and O
for O
all O
and O
for O
all O
the O
world O
to O
see O
. O

To O
settle O
it O
with O
dignity O
, O
independently O
, O
honorably O
. O

Our O
future O
will O
be O
dishonored O
, O
our O
shame O
eternal O
, O
if O
we O
make O
the O
same O
old O
mistakes O
, O
turn O
to O
the O
murderers O
of O
our O
fathers O
, O
brothers O
, O
and O
children O
with O
the O
contrite O
and O
willing O
smile O
of O
assimilation O
and O
lay O
the O
foundations O
for O
a O
new O
tragedy O

This O
is O
what O
I O
am O
saying O
: O
nobody O
else O
in O
this O
world O
contributes O
to O
our O
honor O
or O
shame O
. O

It O
is O
only O
we O
who O
are O
the O
creators O
of O
our O
honor O
or O
shame O
. O

It O
is O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
each O
Jew O
whether O
he O
be O
honorable O
or O
shameful O
. O

He O
was O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
Suddenly O
. O

We O
couldn’t O
even O
say O
goodbye O
. O

An O

about O

in O

powerful O
Günther B-PERS

He O
made O
a O
hypocritical O
speech O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
appease O
them O
, O
promising O
that O
they O
would O
be O
treated O
extremely O
well O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
much O
better O
than O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

With O
the O
condescension O
befitting O
a O
monarch O
, O
he O
called O
upon O
those O
present O
to O
utter O
their O
final O
wishes O
, O
for O
despite O
his O
great O
sympathy O
for O
them O
, O
he O
could O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
return O
home O
. O

They O
would O
depart O
on O
the O
transport O
directly O
from O
the O
Zentralamt B-ORG
. O

He O
told O
them O
this O
and O
then O
went O
up O
to O
each O
person O
and O
asked O
them O
: O
Also O

all O

, O
Günther B-PERS
smiled O

approved O

smiled O

Coincidentally O
, O
Dr O

Kahn B-PERS
stood O
in O
the O
last O
row O
. O

Günther B-PERS
also O
stopped O
in O

him O
and O
said O
with O
a O
smile O
: O
Und O

Kahn O

he O
answered O
resolutely O
and O
clearly O
. O

Günther B-PERS
frowned O
, O
but O
said O
nothing O
and O
left O
. O

There O
was O
movement O
in O
the O
row O
. O

One O
of O
them O
had O
just O
shown O
the O
rest O
what O
character O
truly O
was O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
, O
when O
this O
scoundrel O
was O
taking O
everything O
away O
from O
them O
, O
was O
sentencing O
them O
to O
death O
, O
Dr O
. O

Kahn B-PERS
had O
no O
final O
wish O
. O

And O
then O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
True O
, O
he O
was O
reproached O
for O
standing O
aside O
; O
he O
was O
unwilling O
to O
assume O
a O
role O
of O
responsibility O
in O
the O
ghetto O
leadership O
. O

They O
criticized O
his O
principle O
of O
keeping O
one O
’s O
hands O
clean O
. O

There O
is O
no O
skill O
in O
maintaining O
clean O
hands O
if O
one O
is O
not O
going O
to O
get O
them O
dirty O
. O

But O
this O
is O
not O
how O
dirt O
is O
cleansed O
. O

In O
order O
to O
understand O
his O
attitude O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
one O
must O
know O
his O
character O
. O

He O
simply O
wasn’t O
able O
to O
work O
in O
this O
atmosphere O
. O

He O
proved O
unable O
to O
work O
anywhere O
. O

He O
was O
absolutely O
useless O
when O
it O
came O
to O
communicating O
with O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
as O
incapable O
of O
living O
in O
this O
legal O
, O
or O
rather O
lawless O
, O
atmosphere O
as O
a O
fish O
on O
dry O
land O
. O

Günther B-PERS
himself O
once O
pronounced O
about O
him O
: O
Dieser O
Mann O
ist O
mir O
zu O
wenig O
elastisch O
. O

This O
man O
is O
too O
inflexible O
. O

But O
for O
us O
who O
were O
living O
in O
the O
immorality O
that O
was O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
Dr O
. O

Kahn B-PERS
represented O
a O
living O
conscience O
, O
something O
clean O
in O
all O
of O
this O
dirt O
, O
individualism O
within O
this O
mass O
, O
culture O
in O
this O
barbarism O
. O

Young O
and O
old O
cultural O
workers O
and O
organizers O
from O
the O
offices O
would O
meet O
in O
his O
apartment O
. O

I O
will O
never O
forget O
his O
words O
about O
how O
the O
war O
would O
end O
. O

He O
had O
the O
gift O
of O
true O
judgement O
together O
with O
the O
fantasy O
of O
a O
prophet O
. O

But O
this O
question O
deserves O
separate O
attention O
and O
so O
I O
will O
not O
squeeze O
it O
into O
these O
notes O
. O

And O
then O
he O
left O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
He O
wasn’t O
calm O
, O
although O
he O
tried O
to O
seem O
that O
way O
. O

All O
of O
us O
who O
loved O
him O
met O
in O
the O
evening O
at O
his O
place O
. O

He O
was O
burning O
letters O
and O
mementoes O
of O
his O
youth O
, O
and O
removing O
photographs O
from O
his O
luggage O
. O

With O
a O
heavy O
heart O
, O
he O
tore O
himself O
away O
from O
each O
book O
, O
placing O
it O
into O
the O
box O
that O
we O
would O
keep O
safe O
for O
him O
. O

His O
wife O
was O
crying O
. O

Throwing O
a O
stack O
of O
letters O
into O
the O
fire O
, O
he O
said O
to O
her O
with O
a O
forced O
laugh O
: O
Don’t O
cry O
, O
our O
love O
is O
still O
burning O
strong O
… O
just O
like O
in O
a O
novel O
. O

When O
I O
was O
alone O
with O
him O
, O
he O
told O
me O
: O
And O
so O
goodbye O
. O

Do O
it O
better O
than O
I O
have O
done O
. O

Give O
my O
love O
to O
my O
children O
, O
tell O
them O
everything O
, O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
save O
my O
box O
for O
them O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
gas O
chamber O
closed O
behind O
Dr O
. O

Kahn B-PERS
, O
just O
like O
they O
did O
for O
millions O

his O

whose O
brighter O

he O
worked O
so O

turned O
to O
this O

How O

How O

keep O

uttered O
on O

during O

the O

a O
man O

at O

politically O

This O

In O
view O
of O
the O
heavy O
migration O

the O

At O
the O

time O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
ghetto O
have O
been O
enlarged O
to O
take O
in O
certain O
additional O
blocks O

it O
is O
feared O
that O
this O
enlargement O
may O
mean O
the O
moving O
into O
the O
ghetto O
of O
Jews O
not O
as O
yet O
resident O
in O

It O
has O
also O
been O
decided O
to O
force O
the O
transfer O
of O
Jewish O
owned O

industrial O

the O
removal O
from O

There O
are O
taking O
place O
conversations O

to O
whether O

the O

be O

that O
very O

Löwenstein B-PERS

Dr O

Löwenstein B-PERS
began O
by O
training O
the O
Prussian O
system O
. O

He O
found O
many O
agents O
who O
would O
be O
his O
informants O
and O
he O
had O
the O
privilege O
of O
being O
able O
to O
visit O
the O
Lagerkomandant O
anytime O
, O
something O
that O
only O
the O
Jewish O

could O
have O
done O
until O
then O
, O
or O
another O
person O
accompanied O
by O
him O
. O

Dr O
. O

Löwenstein B-PERS
, O
as O
he O
himself O
said O
, O
was O
a O
first O
lieutenant O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
navy O
, O
he O
was O
supposedly O
the O
guardian O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
prince O
Eitel B-PERS
, O
with O
whom O
he O
was O
– O
as O
he O
said O
himself O
– O
in O
connection O
since O
Postupim B-LOC
until O
he O
was O
called O
away O
to O
Minsk B-GHETTO
in O
Russia B-LOC

He O
spoke O
with O
restraint O
about O
his O
activities O
in O
Minsk B-GHETTO
, O
but O
said O
that O
many O
Jews O
were O
executed O
there O
and O
that O
every O
day O
this O
one O
or O
that O
one O
was O
shot O
by O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
SS O
for O
petty O
reasons O
or O
none O
at O
all O
. O

He O
was O
then O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
probably O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
replace O
him O
or O
remove O
him O
from O
office O
, O
maybe O
even O
save O
him O
. O

He O
was O
supposedly O
mixed O
race O
, O
divorced O
his O
Jewish O
wives O
, O
and O
his O
former O
mother O
- O
in O

Hamburgerová B-PERS
was O
also O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO

Dr O

Löwenstein B-PERS
also O
tried O

in O
a O
large O
part O
succeeded O
in O
being O
popular O
among O
his O
subordinates O
, O
acquiring O
various O
advantages O
for O
them O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
given O
his O
Prussian O
military O
training O
, O
he O
was O
not O
only O
strict O
, O
but O
for O
small O
infractions O
of O
his O
subordinates O
he O
issued O
punishments O
of O
6-week O
prison O
terms O
, O
expulsion O
from O
the O

Members O
of O
the O
camp B-ORG

, O
most O
of O
whom O
were O
former O
soldiers O
, O
or O
rather O
the O
non O
- O
commissioned O
officers O
and O
officers O
of O
the O
former O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
army O
, O
were O
supplemented O
or O
replaced O
by O
a O
similarly O
ranked O
German B-LOC
national O
. O

He O
was O
also O
willing O
to O
accept O
one O
or O
two O
former O
SS O
members O
who O
had O
come O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
as O
mixed O
race O
individuals O
to O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
camp B-ORG
guards I-ORG
, O
etc O
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
shortly O
thereafter O
expelled O
because O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
he O
was O
a O
thief O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Dr O
. O

Löwenstein B-PERS
informed O
the O
Lagerkomandatur O
about O
internal O
affairs O
and O
people O
, O
mainly O
from O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
and O
so O
the O
Lagerkomandant O
was O
always O
well O
informed O
about O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

He O
got O
into O
a O
dispute O
with O
the O
first O
Jewish O
elder O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
later O
with O
Dr O
. O

Epstein B-PERS
and O
Ing O

Zucker B-PERS
and O
others O
, O
he O
didn’t O
hesitate O
to O
write O
down O
his O
thoughts O
about O
these O
Lagerkomandants O

One O
or O
two O
of O
these O
letters O
were O
intercepted O

They O
weren’t O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
right O
place O

Struggles O
with O
the O
main O
leaders O
of O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
led O
to O
almost O
all O
of O
the O

several O
members O

Dr O

he O
was O
sentenced O

3 O
months O

it O

true O

as O
was O

the O
case O

that O
the O

the O

that O
the O

hopes O

avoid O

anti O

not O

are O
made O
to O
him O
, O
the O
whole O
affair O
drags O
on O
until O
the O
person O
concerned O
renounces O
because O
he O
sees O
that O
it O
is O
hopeless O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
, O
the O
people O
are O
surprised O
that O
so O
many O
Jews O
have O
returned O
home O

The O
Poles B-LOC
keep O
saying O
that O
they O
believed O
Hitler B-PERS
murdered O
all O
the O

do O
it O

they O

The O
following O
specific O
case O
is O
cited O
: O
A O
Jew O
, O
for O
example O
, O
received O
an O
apartment O
after O
a O
German O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
it O
was O
taken O
away O
from O
him O
again O
and O
he O
was O
driven O
out O
of O
the O
apartment O

3 O

where O
2 O
- O
3000 O
Jews O
lived O
before O
the O

now O
only O
a O
few O

have O
returned O
, O
members O
of O
the O
A. B-ORG

shot O
2 O
Jews O
, O
after O
which O
the O
official O
newspapers O
took O
a O
stand O
against O
this O
action O
. O

In O
Dąbrowa B-LOC
itself O
there O
were O
6000 O
Jews O
before O
the O
war O
, O
today O
30 O
have O
returned O
as O
normal O
repatriates O
. O

Like O
the O
other O
repatriates O
, O
they O
are O
employed O
by O
the O
employment O
office O
, O
but O
Jews O
have O
the O
sign O

on O
the O

The O
Polish B-LOC
militia O
, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
take O

is O
also O
anti O

After O
the O
end O
of O
the O

, O
about O
10,000 O
of O
the O
250,000 O

are O
found O
in O
Lodz B-LOC

not O

another O
10,000 O
Jews O
, O
who O
returned O
to O
Lodz B-LOC
from O
the O
camps O
and O
were O
registered O
there O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
not O
interested O
in O
getting O
their O
wealth O
back O
, O
they O
all O
want O
to O
leave O
Lodz B-LOC
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
to O
go O
to O
Palestine B-LOC

Minor O

a O
smaller O

, O
are O
officially O
handed O

but O
larger O

are O
nationalized O

The O

the O
same O
as O
for O
all O

i.e O

the O
repatriate O
who O
comes O
home O

for O
2 O

without O

but O
then O
he O
has O
to O
start O

then O
that O
’s O
the O
only O
way O
he O
can O
get O
ration O

The O
following O
case O
is O
presented O
where O
the O

broke O
into O
a O
Jewish O
apartment O
, O
shot O
the O

then O
robbed O
the O
entire O

He O
can O
tell O
a O

about O
such O
acts O
of O

. O

The O
government O
fights O
these O
gangs O
because O
they O
are O
an O
anti- O

, O
reactionary O
trend O

Jews O
hold O
important O
public O

with O
the O
semi O
- O
official O
knowledge O
of O
the O

but O
mostly O
under O

otherwise O
it O

The O
whole O

At O
9 O

the O
young O

gone O
to O

she O
heard O
the O
children O
in O
the O
next O

calling O

She O
straightened O
up O

at O
that O
moment O
a O
bullet O
hit O
the O
aunt O
who O
was O
lying O
next O
to O
her O
in O
bed O

killing O
her O
and O
spattering O
her O
with O
blood O
so O
that O
she O
didn’t O
know O
if O
she O
was O
still O
alive O
. O

Now O
the O
shooting O
had O
just O
started O
. O

The O
bandits O
came O
in O
with O
the O
words O
: O
the O
Jews O
must O
have O
hidden O
their O
gold O
and O
money O
in O
the O
bed O
, O
they O
searched O
the O
bed O
and O
only O
because O
she O
was O
completely O
spattered O
with O
blood O
, O
so O
the O
bandits O
thought O
she O
was O
already O
dead O
, O
was O
her O
life O
saved O
from O
that O
. O

The O
shooting O
and O
robbery O
continued O
until O
12 O
, O
when O
they O
packed O
everything O
they O
had O
stolen O
into O
a O

walked O

In O
the O
attack O
, O
the O

the O

After O

all O

the O

fled O
to O
the O

where O
they O
waited O

During O
the O
day O
, O
the O
young O

went O
out O
into O
the O

and O
recognized O
one O
of O
these O

as O
a O
militiaman O

The O
wounded O

fled O
immediately O

, O
according O

went O

When O

took O
an O

went O

There O

It O
happened O
at O
11 O

the O
Jews O

in O
the O

On O
the O
street O
a O
Polish B-LOC

started O
screaming O
that O

wanted O
to O
murder O
him O

Then O
hundreds O
of O

gathered O
in O
front O
of O
the O
synagogue O
, O
stormed O
and O
demolished O
it O
and O
began O
to O
beat O
the O
Jews O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
murderer O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
pogrom O
was O
the O
alleged O
ritual O
murder O
of O
this O
child O
. O

Crowds O
of O
people O
stormed O
the O
synagogue O
and O
also O
broke O
into O
the O
adjoining O
building O

where O
a O
Chalutzim O

staying O
. O

All O
inmates O
were O
threatened O
with O
a O
gun O
and O
were O
going O
to O
be O
shot O
because O
the O

murderer O
had O
not O
been O

. O

Then O
came O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
A. B-ORG
K. I-ORG

forbade O
shooting O
these O
people O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
, O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
whole O

they O
feared O

During O

It O

[ O
… O
] O
The O
most O
cursory O
reading O
of O
the O
article O
shows O
that O
it O
was O
written O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
stirring O
up O
feeling O
against O
Jews O
as O
a O
class O
. O

The O
most O
definite O
charge O
is O
that O
of O
hoarding O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
long O
ago O
placed O
under O
the O
most O
rigid O
restrictions O
with O
regard O
to O
food O
. O

Further O
, O
they O
have O
been O
so O
thoroughly O
robbed O
of O
all O
their O
possessions O
, O
including O
all O
bank O
accounts O
, O
that O
few O
of O
them O
have O
any O
considerable O
wealth O
now O
at O
their O
disposal O
. O

The O
general O
terms O
employed O
by O
the O
writer O
would O
indicate O
that O
he O
is O
not O
writing O
on O
a O
factual O
basis O
but O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
an O
effect O
, O
that O
is O
, O
suspicion O
and O
hatred O
toward O
the O
Jew O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
inflammatory O
article O
against O
the O
Jews O
which O
has O
appeared O
in O
any O
newspaper O
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

All O
evidence O
coming O
our O
[ O
sic O
] O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
indicates O
that O
the O
Bulgarian O
people O
generally O
disapprove O
of O
the O
harsh O
measures O
being O
taken O
by O
the O
Government O
against O
Jews O
and O
do O
what O
they O
can O
to O
alleviate O
their O
condition O

The O
recent O

the O
case O
with O

The O

would O
not O
appear O

envisaged O
by O

active O

[ O

A O
strange O
commentary O
on O
life O
in O
German O
- O
occupied O
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
presented O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
a O
nationalist O
Pole O
has O
endeavored O
to O
take O
on O
the O
‘ O
protective O
coloration O
’ O
of O
the O
Jew O
in O
order O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
German B-ORG
police I-ORG
or O
to O
avoid O
compulsory O
labor O
. O

These O
‘ O
refugees O
’ O
have O
adopted O
Jewish O
insignia O
and O
taken O
up O
residence O
in O
the O
ghetto O
; O
many O
stories O
are O
current O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
of O
Jews O
tearing O
off O
their O
racial O
badges O
and O
passing O
them O
over O
in O
the O
streets O
to O
fleeing O
Poles O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
during O
the O
period O
of O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
disturbances O
in O
Poland B-LOC
prior O
to O
German O
occupation O
the O
600,000 O
people O
in O
the O
Jewish O
district O
, O
almost O
evenly O
divided O
between O
Poles O
and O
Jews O
, O
managed O
to O
get O
along O
together O
peacefully O
and O
lived O
in O
a O
community O
spirit O
which O
was O
not O
noticeable O
in O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
pending O
segregation O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
an O
official O
ghetto O
affects O
an O
equal O
number O
of O
Poles O
and O
the O

greater O

it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
things O
I O
ever O

The O

had O
only O
the O
purpose O

goal O

to O
exterminate O

as O

B. B-PERS
Blank I-PERS

a O
thorough O
job O

It O
was O
not O
enough O
for O
them O
to O
that O
the O
people O
there O
were O
collapsing O
from O
starvation O
and O
cold O
; O
at O
night O
they O
used O
to O
come O
to O
the O
small O
camp O
and O
commit O
murder O
with O
blows O
and O
revolver O
shots O
. O

The O
camp O
was O
separated O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
camp O
by O
barbed O
wire O
. O

Every O
day O
at O
morning O
and O
evening O
roll O

you O
could O
see O
people O
who O
were O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
stand O
on O
their O
feet O
, O
who O
squatted O
on O
the O
floor O
or O
even O
stretched O
out O
there O
, O
quite O
apathetic O
, O
with O
sunken O
cheeks O
, O
deep O
- O
set O
eyes O
staring O
into O
nothing O
, O
often O
in O
their O
own O
feces O
because O
they O
did O
not O
even O
have O
the O
strength O
to O
answer O
the O
call O

nature O

I O
saw O
many O
holding O
onto O
the O
barbed O
wire O
with O
both O
hands O
, O
fingers O
cramped O
, O
bleeding O
from O
the O
hands O
and O
face O
, O
unwashed O
for O
days O

with O
cheeks O
turning O
blue O

resembling O
a O
skull O
more O
than O
a O
living O

Diarrhea O
and O
dysentery O
raged O
among O
these O
people O

One O
day O
we O
carried O
blankets O
to O
the O
small O
camp O

and O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
see O
the O
compartment O
for O
so O

called O
snipers O

It O
was O
a O
cage O
in O
which O
71 O
Poles O
were O
locked O

These O
people O
had O
only O
a O
shabby O
blanket O
during O
the O
exceptionally O
harsh O
winter O
and O
were O
given O
almost O
nothing O
to O
eat O

As O
we O
got O
closer O

we O
could O
only O
hear O
moaning O
, O
crying O
and O
screams O
of O
pain O

A O
single O
prisoner O
left O
this O
area O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
later O
died O
as O
a O
result O

the O
frostbite O
he O
suffered O
there O

Several O
times O
I O
was O
able O
to O
observe O
how O
the O
dying O
were O
dragged O
along O
to O
receive O
their O
portions O

their O
hands O
stretched O
out O
to O
get O
the O
bit O
of O
bread O
that O
was O
given O
to O
them O
in O
their O
poor O
condition O

The O
following O
was O
a O
very O
popular O
method O
of O
annihilation O
: O
On O
particularly O
cold O
days O
, O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O

were O

in O

This O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
enough O
for O
a O
Jew O
who O
was O
working O
hard O
in O
the O
open O
air O
, O
in O
heavy O

Even O
shopping O

In O

there O
was O
very O
little O
to O

and O
almost O
nothing O

Jews O
, O
however O
, O
often O
had O
to O
pay O
higher O
prices O

were O
forced O
to O
buy O
items O
that O
did O
not O
sell O
and O
which O
they O
had O
to O
buy O
at O
inflated O
prices O

Even O
in O
little O
things O
, O
discrimination O
was O
carried O
out O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
Jew O
was O
only O
allowed O
to O
write O
one O
page O
per O
month O
, O
while O
the O
Aryan O
was O
allowed O
to O
write O
4 O

twice O

from O
the O

was O
striking O
that O
even O
in O
the O
great O
mass O
who O
came O
to O
the O

, O
one O
did O
not O
find O
any O

I O

i.e O

in O
the O
very O
few O
cases O
in O

Protectorate B-LOC
Jews O
were O
dismissed O

that O
only O

although O
the O
action O
also O
included O
very O
poor O
Jews O
whose O
political O
disinterest O
was O
notorious O
. O

Shortly O
before O
their O
release O
, O
the O
lucky O
few O
used O
to O
receive O
the O
news O
of O
the O
sale O

their O
business O

We O
could O
see O
the O
connection O

Before O
the O
war O
began O
, O
Jews O
were O
released O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
cases O
where O
they O
had O
completed O
all O
formalities O
, O
had O
their O
emigration O

and O
had O
liquidated O
all O
their O

After O
the O

, O
the O
dismissals O
were O
rare O
, O
and O
beginning O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1940 B-DATE

they O
stopped O
completely O

only O
a O

No O
member O

made O
a O

fact O
that O
there O
was O
only O
one O

for O

the O

When O

the O
statement O

states O

the O
then O
commander O
of O
the O
quarry O
, O
Max O
Engler O
, O
who O
himself O
was O
a O
Jew O
, O
called O
to O
me O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
raise O
100 O
Mk O
, O
which O
he O
needed O
for O
the O
Kapo O
of O
the O
quarry O

Vogl O

That O
was O
a O
very O
large O
amount O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O

When O
I O
raised O
cautious O
objections O
, O
he O
declared O
openly O
that O
he O
would O
have O
to O
get O
the O
amount O
, O
otherwise O
he O
would O
take O
revenge O
. O

That O
meant O
the O
worst O
abuses O
and O
the O
death O
of O
some O
comrades O

We O
eventually O
agreed O
only O
on O
70 O

which O
he O
also O
received O

When O
Jews O
were O

the O
principle O
strictly O
observed O
was O
that O
Jews O
should O
not O
work O
in O
workshops O

under O
roofs O

The O

was O
the O

At O

Tendonitis O
was O
a O
frequent O
consequence O
of O
this O
heavy O

exhausting O
work O

Until O

instead O
a O

18 O
young O
Jews O
and O
a O
brakeman O

were O
harnessed O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1941 B-DATE
we O
often O
went O
to O
the O
quarry O
for O
rubble O
. O

Only O
4 O
people O
were O
able O
to O
do O
this O
work O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
while O
the O
others O
were O
able O
to O
rest O
. O

That O
was O
a O
thorn O

side O
of O

Greul B-PERS

While O
the O
four O
comrades O
had O
to O
load O
the O
rubble O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
driven O
into O
the O
quarry O
and O
had O
to O
carry O
heavy O
stones O
; O
even O
a O
brief O
rest O
was O
denied O
them O
. O

Individual O
Jewish O
transport O
columns O
carried O
heavy O
tree O
trunks O
out O
of O
the O
forest O
, O
on O
their O
shoulders O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
in O
winter O
was O
it O
easier O
to O
work O
because O
skids O
could O
be O
used O
on O
the O
snow O
. O

In O
the O
Gardening O
commando O
, O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
transport O
fertilizer O
, O
manure O
and O
earth O
in O
fully O
loaded O
wooden O
girders O
across O
the O
wide O
, O

After O
dissolution O

February B-DATE

boys O
from O
16 O
- O
18 O
years O
were O
promised O
that O
they O
would O
be O
classified O
as O
gardeners O
’ O
apprentices O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
used O
to O
transport O
fertilizer O
with O
only O
2 O
or O
3 O
exceptions O
. O

This O
was O
actually O
the O
case O
with O
the O
retraining O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

If O
a O
Jew O
in O
the O
camp O
was O
asked O
why O
he O
was O
there O
, O
the O
most O
sensible O
answer O
was O
: O
For O
retraining O
. O

All O
work O
was O
carried O
out O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
limits O
of O
human O
performance O
or O
the O
expediency O
of O
the O
work O
. O

People O
were O
hunted O
, O
thrashed O
, O
tormented O
at O
every O
opportunity O
, O
so O
that O
even O
relatively O
light O
work O
became O
an O
agony O
of O
severe O
torments O
. O

In O
torturing O
, O
the O
following O
stood O
out O

list O

these O

even O
that O

one O

the O

a O
summary O

anti O

Jewish O
measures O
in O

Confiscation O

apparently O
been O
the O
principal O
weapons O
employed O
in O
recent O

in O
addition O

heavily O

the O

of O
the O
Bulgarians O

that O

Concerning O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
Currently O
there O
are O
about O
50,000 O
Jews O
in O
this O
country O
, O
of O
which O
about O
26,000 O
live O
in O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

Although O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
any O
influence O
in O
the O
cultural O
sphere O
, O
in O
business O
( O
especially O
commerce O
) O
they O
are O
extremely O
influential O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
is O
increasingly O
the O
view O
that O
something O
must O
be O
done O
about O
this O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
, O
In O
the O
“ O
Law O
for O
the O
Protection O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
” O
promulgated O
in O
January B-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
Government O
established O
several O
articles O
concerning O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

However O
, O
the O
actual O
effect O
was O
rather O
limited O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
last O
fall O
the O
government O
received O
full O
authority O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jews O
. O

Consequently O
, O
they O
established O
a O
new O
bureau O
and O
required O
Jews O
to O
wear O
yellow O
tags O
, O
placed O
limitation O
on O
their O
residence O
as O
well O
as O
on O
their O
activities O
besides O
business O
, O
and O
their O
control O
of O
property O
2.6 O
billion O
leva O
etc O
. O

The O
government O
pursued O
a O
policy O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
such O
policies O
were O
not O
very O
popular O
. O

In O
January O
this O
year O
the O
vice O
speaker O
of O
the O
Parliament O
and O
about O
forty O
members O
of O
the O
Parliament O
criticized O
the O
government O
measures O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
vice O
speaker O
. O

( O
There O
is O
rumor O
that O
the O
Jews O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
this O
) O
. O

Recently O
many O
Jews O
are O
accused O
of O
being O
involved O
in O
terror O
, O
sabotage O
, O
spying O
and O
other O
forms O
of O
political O
agitation O
, O
and O
engaging O
in O
black O
market O
that O
should O
be O
called O
the O
cancer O
of O
Bulgarian O
economy O
. O

The O
government O
came O
to O
force O
Jews O
living O
in O
Sofia B-LOC
to O
relocate O
to O
local O
areas O
because O
it O
was O
not O
very O
successful O
to O
leave O
the O
matter O
to O
their O
own O
will O
( O
only O
2,600 O
had O
moved O
out O
so O
far O
) O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the O
government O
will O
notify O
Jews O
about O
the O
destination O
for O
their O
relocation O
within O
two O
to O
three O
weeks O
. O

After O
receiving O
the O
notice O
the O
Jews O
must O
leave O
the O
city O
within O
three O
days O
. O

Concerning O
this O
new O
measure O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Orthodox O
Church O
Stefan B-PERS
and O
others O
lodged O
protest O
against O
and O
it O
was O
not O
very O
popular O
in O
general O
. O

The O
Government O
, O
however O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
city O
’s O
political O
and O
economic O
condition O
will O
improve O
after O
the O
expulsion O
of O
all O
of O
its O
Jews O
. O

12,000 O
Jews O
who O
live O
in O
the O
new O
territories O
of O
Macedonia B-LOC
and O
Thrace B-LOC
have O
been O
deported O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

( O
Now O
the O
Jews O
who O
live O
in O
these O
new O
territories O
are O
mainly O
those O
with O
foreign O
citizenship O
and O
number O
no O
more O
than O
6,700 O
. O

) O
Although O
there O
was O
a O
plan O
to O
deport O
the O
10,000 O
Jews O
who O
live O
in O
the O
old O
territories O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
new O
measure O
this O
plan O
was O
put O
on O
hold O
. O

Through O
the O
intermediary O
of O
Switzerland B-LOC
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-LOC
Government O
has O
reached O
an O
agreement O
with O
Britain B-LOC
to O
send O
5,000 O
Jews O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
they O
became O
entangled O
in O
the O
detailed O
articles O
and O
the O
agreement O
had O
not O
been O
implemented O

The O

, O
31.7.1945 B-DATE
The O
Lecture O
Series O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
The O
lecture O
series O
began O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1942 B-DATE
and O
ended O
in O
May B-DATE
1945 I-DATE
. O

It O
took O
place O
entirely O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
leisure O
activities O
( O
Freizeitgestalltung O
) O
. O

The O
demand O
for O
lectures O
was O
very O
high O
. O

40 O
- O
50,000 O
ghetto B-GHETTO
inmates O
, O
among O
them O
many O
thousands O
of O
intellectuals O
, O
begged O
for O
mental O
stimulation O
. O

The O
young O
people O
, O
who O
had O
been O
without O
schooling O
for O
years O
, O
urgently O
needed O
further O
education O
. O

The O
various O
experts O
exchanged O
their O
experiences O
, O
etc O
. O

It O
was O
very O
aggravating O
when O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
the O
superior O
authority O
had O
banned O
any O
form O
of O
teaching O
and O
independent O
scientific O
research O
. O

Therefore O
, O
camouflage O
had O
to O
be O
used O
again O
and O
again O
in O
formulating O
the O
program O
descriptions O
and O
responsibility O
for O
managing O
the O
events O
themselves O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
over O
. O

A O
special O
word O
of O
thanks O
goes O
to O
the O
youth O
workers O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
whom O
are O
dead O
today O
. O

They O
selflessly O
took O
on O
great O
personal O
risk O
again O
and O
again O
to O
give O
the O
young O
people O
at O
least O
a O
bit O
of O
education O
. O

Even O
the O
language O
courses O
, O
which O
seemed O
desirable O
in O
hope O
of O
future O
emigration O
, O
could O
only O
pass O
under O
the O
flag O
of O
lectures O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
since O
publications O
of O
any O
kind O
were O
prohibited O
, O
it O
was O
only O
possible O
to O
communicate O
the O
results O
of O
scientific O
or O
artistic O
work O
in O
the O
form O
of O
lectures O
or O
recitations O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
lecture O
series O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
had O
a O
much O
wider O
function O
than O
it O
would O
have O
had O
under O
normal O
circumstances O
and O
was O
divided O
into O
the O
following O
departments O
: O
Scientific O
Lectures O
: O
Various O
scientific O

made O
up O
its O
core O

the O

, O
the O
medical O

, O
the O
technical O
department O
, O
the O

tried O

Partly O

It O
seems O
to O
us O
a O
guilty O
act O
of O
filial O
piety O
to O
commemorate O
the O
young O
native O
writer O
Georg B-PERS

in O
which O
23 O

( O

Depending O
on O
the O
time O
of O

, O
the O
bodies O
are O
likely O
from O
the O
last O
three O
death O

( O

According O
to O
the O
statements O
of O
those O
arrested O
as O
well O
as O
what O
some O
of O
the O
locals O
have O
told O
us O
, O
whenever O
they O
saw O
the O
participants O
of O
the O
death O

, O
the O
people O
were O
totally O
starving O

except O
for O
several O
who O
were O

Concerning O
those O

were O
shot O
or O
perhaps O
beaten O
to O
death O
, O
we O
could O
find O
no O

When O
they O
marched O
through O
the O

the O
police O
of O

them O
make O

The O
third O
grave O
, O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
contain O
the O
bodies O
of O
4 O
shot O
men O
, O
likely O
Russians B-LOC

who O

found O
by O
the O

An O
SS O
- O
Scharführer O
whose O
name O
I O
don’t O
recall O
came O
to O
me O
before O
the O
burials O
with O
a O
request O
to O
tell O
him O
where O
to O
bury O
the O
bodies O
. O

I O
showed O
him O
a O
place O
to O
bury O
10 O
people O
in O
the O
cemetery O
by O
the O
mortuary O
and O
where O
to O
bury O
8 O
people O
behind O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
cemetery O
. O

There O
wasn’t O
any O
room O
left O
in O
the O
cemetery O
. O

The O
dead O
were O
participants O
in O
the O
death O
marches O
who O
had O
come O
from O
Karlovy B-LOC
Vary I-LOC
through O
Teplá B-LOC
. O

One O
group O
had O
probably O
marched O
to O
Mariánské B-LOC
Lázně I-LOC
and O
the O
second O
towards O
Bezdružice B-LOC
. O

About O
1,500 O
people O
marched O
through O
here O
. O

For O
about O
two O
or O
three O
days O
, O
about O
700 O
stayed O
in O
the O
barn O
by O
the O
cemetery O
, O
300 O
people O
stayed O
in O
the O
Fichtenbühlhof O
courtyard O
, O
and O
some O
also O
stayed O
in O
the O
sheep O
stable O
near O
Klášter B-LOC
Teplá B-LOC
. O

9 O
people O
from O
this O
death O
march O
died O
, O
most O
likely O
of O
hunger O
and O
exhaustion O
. O

One O
woman O
was O
shot O
by O
SS O
guards O
during O
the O
night O
when O
she O
wanted O
to O
go O
and O
get O
some O
food O
from O
the O
nearby O
houses O
. O

These O
first O
ten O
victims O
were O
buried O
by O
the O
SS O
members O
themselves O
. O

The O
SS O
- O
men O
dug O
the O
graves O
themselves O
and O
then O
covered O
them O
. O

The O
gravedigger O
was O
at O
the O
cemetery O
, O
but O
didn’t O
participate O
in O
the O
burials O
because O
he O
had O
other O
work O
to O
do O
. O

SS O
members O
came O
to O
builder O
Kroy B-PERS
before O
the O
burials O
to O
ask O
him O
to O
give O
them O
people O
to O
help O
with O
the O
burials O
, O
but O
he O
couldn’t O
assign O
them O
any O
and O
so O
they O
buried O
the O
bodies O
all O
by O
themselves O
. O

The O
next O
8 O
victims O
were O
from O
the O
death O
march O
that O
passed O
through O
Teplá B-LOC
several O
days O
later O
. O

He O
was O
told O
, O
I O
can’t O
remember O
by O
whom O
, O
that O
there O
are O
8 O
bodies O
from O
the O
death O
march O
of O
prisoners O
lying O
out O
by O
the O
barn O
. O

I O
took O
some O
refugees O
with O
me O
, O
and O
when O
I O
came O
to O
the O
place O
, O
the O
dead O
had O
already O
been O
loaded O
onto O
a O
cart O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
who O
loaded O
them O
. O

Gravedigger O
’s O
note O
: O
the O
coach O

who O
transported O
them O
is O
named O
Jan B-PERS

and O
he O
works O
in O

They O
were O
taken O
by O
cart O
to O
the O
cemetery O
, O
where O
they O
were O
buried O
behind O
the O
wall O
. O

I O
selected O
the O
burial O
place O
myself O
because O
in O
Klášter B-LOC
Teplá B-LOC
there O
is O
no O
cemetery O
overseer O
. O

I O
was O
told O
sometime O
in O
April B-DATE
that O
there O
were O
dead O
bodies O
by O
the O
barn O
. O

I O
went O
there O
the O
next O
day O
at O
about O
11:00 O
and O
the O
dead O
were O
already O
loaded O
onto O
a O
cart O
. O

I O
selected O
some O
refugees O
to O
pull O
the O
cart O
to O
the O
cemetery O
and O
bury O
the O
corpses O
in O
a O
common O
ditch O
. O

I O
can’t O
remember O
how O
deep O
it O
was O

Councilman O
Ferdinand B-PERS

also O
present O

The O
gravedigger O
wasn’t O
present O
at O
this O
second O
burial O
either O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
were O
only O
bones O
, O
but O
I O
don’t O
know O
which O
. O

It O
wasn’t O
my O
responsibility O
to O
bury O
the O
dead O
because O
I’m O
just O
a O
builder O
here O
in O
Klášter B-LOC
Teplá B-LOC
and O
not O
the O
mayor O
. O

I O
allowed O
the O
dead O
to O
be O
buried O
behind O
the O
cemetery O
wall O
because O
there O
wasn’t O
any O
room O
left O
in O
the O
cemetery O
proper O
. O

I O
assumed O
that O
they O
would O
expand O
the O
cemetery O
. O

I O
didn’t O
notify O
the O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
authorities O
that O
came O
here O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Reich O
because O
I O
didn’t O
know O
that O
I O
had O
to O

everyone O
in O
Klášter B-LOC

Kroy B-PERS

that O
he O
always O

as O
far O
as O
he O
remembers O

on O
about O
April B-DATE

of O

he O
heard O
that O
some O
prisoner O
death O
marches O
were O
housed O
in O
the O
barns O
around O
Klášter B-LOC
. O

Since O
this O
did O
not O
fall O
under O
his O
responsibility O
, O
he O
paid O
no O
more O
attention O
to O
it O
. O

Around O
the O
same O
time O
, O
a O
certain O
SS O
- O
man O
, O
who O
was O
staying O
overnight O
in O
the O
area O
with O
another O
death O
march O
, O
came O
to O
him O
to O
ask O
him O
for O
the O
keys O
to O
the O
cemetery O
, O
because O
they O
apparently O
had O
to O
bury O
some O
bodies O
. O

He O
sent O
him O
to O
builder O
Kroy B-PERS
. O

After O
this O
incident O
, O
Kroy B-PERS
once O
told O
him O
that O
yet O
another O
death O
march O
had O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
the O
Schäfferhäuser O
barn O
and O
had O
left O
some O
dead O
bodies O
behind O
after O
it O
departed O
. O

He O
wanted O
him O
to O
come O
and O
check O
it O
out O
with O
him O
. O

Later O
, O
around O
11 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
went O
there O
together O
and O
found O
the O
cart O
by O
the O
barn O
that O
was O
loaded O
with O
corpses O
. O

He O
therefore O
entreated O
Kroy B-PERS
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
, O
which O
Kroy B-PERS
promised O
he O
would O
. O

When O
he O
later O
asked O
him O
about O
it O
, O
Kroy B-PERS
told O
him O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

This O
is O
all O
he O
knows O
and O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
matter O
. O

So O
far O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
difficulties O
for O
Jews O
wishing O
to O
flee O
the O
perils O
of O
Romania B-LOC
was O
that O
the O
Turkish O
Legation O
here O
was O
not O
empowered O
to O
give O
a O
transit O
visa O
unless O
the O
applicant O
could O
show O
a O
visa O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
or O
Syria B-LOC
which O
the O
British O
have O
not O
given O
us O
authority O
to O
grant O
, O
and O
which O
is O
not O
accorded O
to O
residents O
of O
enemy O
occupied O
countries O
such O
as O
Romania B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
therefore O
struck O
yesterday O
when O
my O
Turkish O
colleague O
called O
to O
say O
that O
he O
had O
strongly O
urged O
by O
telegram O
upon O
his O
Government B-ORG
the O
desirability O
of O
conferring O
with O
the O
British O
, O
and O
, O
out O
of O
courtesy O
, O
with O
the O
French O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
there O
was O
not O
some O
way O
to O
arrange O
temporary O
lodgings O
in O
barracks O
in O
Syria B-LOC
or O
Palestine B-LOC
for O
the O
unfortunate O
Jews O
still O
left O
in O
Romania B-LOC

[ O
... O
] O
I O
am O
wholly O
in O
accord O
with O
his O
proposal O
which O
, O
if O
adopted O
, O
might O
save O
many O
innocent O
lives O
and O
spare O
extreme O
human O
suffering O
. O

I O
have O
no O
illusions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Romanians O
will O
ever O
let O
these O
poor O
people O
out O
of O
their O
clutches O
with O
more O

believed O
therefore O
to O
have O
been O
a O
voyage O
of O
inspection O
in O
order O
to O
report O
to O
the O
Vatican O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

As O
to O
the O
question O
if O
the O
Nuncio O
’s O
journey O
served O
indeed O
the O
purpose O
of O
providing O
an O
exact O
picture O
of O
the O
Jewish O
situation O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
I O
already O
reported O
on O
this O
in O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Nuncio O
was O
not O
convinced O
by O
the O
tame O
ghetto O
he O
was O
shown O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
Vatican O
concerning O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
was O
joined O
by O
further O
pressure O
from O
the O
international O
Red O
Cross O
, O
which O
has O
friends O
and O
supporters O
among O
the O
highest O
Romanian O
circles O
. O

As O
for O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
as O
follows O
. O

When O
Romanian B-LOC
and O
German O
troops O
occupied O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews O
at O
first O
experienced O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
– O
particularly O
in O
Odessa B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
about O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
persons O
who O
had O
not O
been O
evacuated O
– O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
carried O
out O
a O
registration O
and O
some O
arrests O
. O

After O
the O
terrorist O
acts O
and O
particularly O
after O
the O
one O
of O
23rd O
October O
there O
were O
brutal O
reprisals O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
numbers O
, O
but O
many O
thousands O
, O
perhaps O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
were O
eliminated O
and O
arrested O
. O

In O
was O
then O
that O
temporary O
ghettoes O
and O
places O
for O
concentration O
were O
created O
. O

Orders O
however O
were O
as O
yet O
unclear O
, O
and O
already O
in O
November O
many O
of O
these O
Jews O
were O
set O
free O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
December O
’ O
41 O
and O
in O
January O
’ O
42 O
, O
during O
the O
harshest O
of O
winters O
, O
that O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
decided O
to O
remove O
the O
Jews O
from O
Odessa B-LOC
. O

I O
hardly O
need O
to O
describe O
how O
this O
emigration O
took O
place O
. O

The O
Germans O
themselves O
admit O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
with O
greater O
humanity O
. O

Anyway O
, O
those O
who O
managed O
to O
reach O
on O
foot O
the O
places O
of O
concentration O
, O
were O
banned O
to O
ghettoes O
, O
that O
is O
to O
sites O
in O
the O
suburbs O
of O
small O
provincial O
towns O
. O

Considering O
the O
meteorological O
and O
political O
climate O
, O
they O
were O
treated O
with O
scant O
regard O
and O
no O
doubt O
the O
well O
- O
known O
oppressive O
measures O
will O
have O
continued O
there O
, O
set O
off O
by O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
Germans O
, O
for O
their O
part O
, O
have O
acted O
similarly O
in O
the O
areas O
surrounding O
the O
territories O
inhabited O
by O
German O
communities O
. O

This O
system O
of O
things O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
has O
been O
useful O
to O
all O
to O
rebuild O
what O
had O
been O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
losses O
and O
to O
create O
benefits O
, O
lasted O
more O
or O
less O
intensely O
, O
more O
or O
less O
arbitrarily O
until O
June O
of O
last O
year O
. O

After O
that O
the O
situation O
stabilized O
or O
, O
to O
put O
it O
more O
exactly O
, O
was O
rendered O
legal O
. O

For O
a O
start O
, O
rules O
began O
to O
be O
published O
regarding O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
of O
Jews O
, O
the O
deadline O
for O
reporting O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
also O
the O
activity O
of O
Jews O
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
ghettoes O
has O
been O
specified O
, O
they O
have O
been O
granted O
a O
form O
of O
self O
- O
government O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
if O
the O
oppressive O
measures O
have O
ceased O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
would O
depend O
on O
the O
local O
authorities O
and O
on O
whether O
the O
Jews O
are O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
compromise O
with O
them O
. O

What O
can O
be O
said O
with O
certainty O
is O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
during O
the O
past O
months O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews O
has O
not O
grown O
any O
worse O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
this O
in O
person O
. O

In O
Balta B-LOC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
approx O
. O

fifteen O
thousand O
Jews O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
ghetto O
is O
in O
a O
suburban O
part O
of O
the O
town O
and O
is O
made O
up O
of O
wretched O
cottages O
where O
a O
great O
many O
families O
live O
in O
deplorable O
hygienic O
conditions O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curfew O
imposed O
on O
the O
ghetto O
which O
starts O
at O
sundown O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
not O
allowed O
into O
the O
public O
market O
, O
nor O
can O
they O
frequent O
the O
town O
’s O
establishments O
. O

There O
is O
a O
municipal O
authority O
that O
manages O
the O
community O
and O
supplies O
the O
required O
manpower O
. O

Jews O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
in O
the O
surrounding O
areas O
. O

Those O
who O
work O
receive O
one O
mark O
a O
day O
and O
a O
substantial O
bread O
ration O
. O

The O
more O
unfortunate O
Jews O
, O
however O
, O
live O
or O
rather O
vegetate O
inside O
the O
ghetto O
; O
the O
more O
able O
ones O
and O
particularly O
the O
young O
female O
elements O
manage O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
live O
outside O
the O
ghetto O
and O
in O
any O
case O
enjoy O
visible O
advantages O
for O
their O
lives O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
this O
situation O
in O
Balta B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Rybnitsa B-LOC
is O
more O
or O
less O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
other O
ghettoes O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
numbers O
of O
deported O
or O
concentrated O
Jews O
change O
all O
the O
time O
. O

( O
I O
have O
myself O
seen O
in O
Balta B-LOC
about O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
just O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
, O
mostly O
young O
people O
assigned O
to O
four O
months O
of O
compulsory O
work O
there O
) O
. O

In O
Bereswka O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
Jews O
has O
even O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
Prefecture O
, O
to O
posts O
of O
varying O
importance O
, O
with O
regular O
salaries O
. O

This O
denotes O
a O
marked O
improvement O
compared O
to O
last O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
in O
itself O
would O
not O
have O
any O
great O
significance O
, O
if O
some O
recent O
information O
, O
such O
as O
the O
news O
that O
has O
prompted O
the O
present O
report O
, O
did O
not O
confer O
on O
the O
situation O
an O
aspect O
that O
I O
believe O
ought O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
an O
excellent O
source O
that O
recently O
, O
at O
an O
ordinary O
conference O
of O
the O
Prefects O
of O
Transnistria B-LOC
held O
by O
the O
Governor O
in O
Rybniysa B-LOC
, O
these O
officials O
allegedly O
gave O
as O
their O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
present O
situation O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
war O
remains O
uncertain O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
seemed O
advisable O
to O
improve O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
or O
to O
lessen O
the O
restrictions O
on O
their O
freedom O
and O
allow O
them O
ways O
to O
resume O
a O
greater O
activity O
. O

Reportedly O
there O
was O
even O
talk O
of O
giving O
the O
Jews O
some O
compensation O
for O
the O
damages O
they O
have O
suffered O
. O

Thus O
their O
situation O
would O
be O
rendered O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
and O
in O
other O
Romanian B-LOC
towns O
. O

Naturally O
this O
news O
, O
which O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
discernible O
general O
trend O
towards O
improving O
the O
condition O
of O
Jews O
, O
has O
annoyed O
German O
circles O
and O
made O
them O
mistrustful O
. O

They O
suggest O
that O
the O
Jewish O
question O
cannot O
be O
handled O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
any O
differently O
from O
how O
it O
has O
been O
handled O
until O
now O
. O

The O
reasons O
given O
by O
the O
Prefects O
and O
by O
those O
in O
favour O
of O
improving O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
arise O
from O
a O
pessimistic O
view O
of O
the O
Axis O
’ O
s O
general O
situation O
, O
and O
that O
is O
totally O
unacceptable O
. O

They O
are O
therefore O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
entire O
matter O
is O
essentially O
decided O
by O
the O
Government O
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
influenced O
by O
the O
steps O
undertaken O
by O
the O
Vatican O
and O
by O
Geneva O
, O
and O
has O
easily O
taken O
root O
in O
the O
Anglophile O
and O
Francophile O
circles O
, O
whether O
military O
or O
civilian O
, O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish O
question O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
therefore O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
Romania O
and O
of O
the O
opinion O
held O
by O
certain O
classes O
of O
Romanians B-LOC
concerning O
the O
development O
of O
that O
situation O

feeling O

serious O

are O
under O
the O

However O
, O
as O
Nazi O
Germany O
knows O
international O
Zionism O
very O
well O
from O
its O
bitter O
experience O
in O
the O
past O

it O
pursues O
repressive O
rule O

- O
vis O
the O
two O
millions O
Jews O
by O
introducing O
Force O
Labor O
system O
or O
confiscation O
of O
their O
property O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
( O
the O
German O
authorities O
) O
strives O
for O
a O
final O
solution O
of O
the O
question O
of O
the O
Jewish O
question O
The O
Department O
will O
note O
that O
the O
law O
was O
modified O
substantially O
. O

Primarily O
, O
the O
class O
of O
Jews O
to O
be O
considered O
officially O
as O
Christians O
was O
enlarged O
but O
its O
economic O
restrictions O
were O
increased O
, O
thus O
creating O
a O
sort O
of O
second O
- O
class O
citizenship O
. O

This O
represents O
the O
real O
compromise O
made O
between O
the O
two O
houses B-ORG
of I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
. O

Also O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
placing O
the O
Jews O
in O
a O
distinct O
category O
for O
political O
purposes O
was O
discarded O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
Jews O
retain O
free O
active O
and O
passive O
suffrage O
, O
but O
the O
conditions O
of O
their O
enfranchisement O
were O
made O
much O
more O
severe O
. O

Agricultural O
property O
may O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
Jews O
, O
their O
right O
to O
acquire O
real O
estate O
is O
limited O
, O
and O
the O
restriction O
of O
their O
employment O
is O
greatly O
increased O
. O

Jewish O
journalists O
complain O
bitterly O
against O
the O
special O
press O
restriction O
by O
which O
the O
law O
was O
amended O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Jewish O
youth O
will O
suffer O
the O
most O
. O

when O
the O

although O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
would O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
labor O
camp O
in O
Heidebreck B-LOC

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
worked O
in O
the O
potato O
kitchen O
, O
where O
I O
was O
continuously O
terrorized O
by O
its O
leader O
( O
a O
Pole B-LOC
named O
Vacek B-PERS
) O
( O
Václav B-PERS
Lada I-PERS
) O
and O
by O
the O
SSmen O
overseeing O
the O
kitchen O
. O

We O
worked O
from O
4 O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
6 O
, O
or O
sometimes O
8 O
, O
in O
the O
evening O
without O
stopping O
, O
except O
for O
when O
we O
could O
eat O
lunch O
. O

If O
Vacek B-PERS
thought O
we O
were O
working O
too O
slowly O
, O
he O
would O
take O
a O
cane O
and O
beat O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Although O
he O
himself O
stole O
whole O
bags O
of O
potatoes O
and O
took O
from O
the O
kitchen O
kilos O
of O
sugar O
and O
margarine O
that O
were O
designated O
as O
meager O
rations O
for O
the O
prisoners O
and O
exchanged O
them O
for O
tobacco O
and O
jewels O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
live O
a O
debauched O
life O
, O
all O
it O
took O
for O
him O
to O
satisfy O
his O
sadistic O
whims O
in O
the O
cruelest O
ways O
was O
for O
him O
to O
find O
in O
the O
pockets O
of O
the O
potato O
peelers O
, O
or O
in O
the O
soup O
left O
aside O
for O
the O
peeler O
’ O
s O
family O
members O
, O
a O
single O
potato O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
order O
the O
prisoner O
to O
put O
the O
potato O
in O
his O
mouth O
, O
squat O
on O
a O
stool O
, O
pick O
up O
another O
stool O
in O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
exercise O
. O

When O
the O
poor O
man O
could O
no O
longer O
continue O
, O
Vacek B-PERS
would O
use O
a O
cane O
or O
he O
would O
break O
off O
the O
metal O
part O
of O
a O
shovel O
and O
hit O
him O
with O
the O
shaft O
. O

If O
the O
prisoner O
was O
still O
able O
to O
move O
, O
he O
would O
make O
him O
spin O
around O
the O
shovel O
until O
he O
got O
dizzy O
. O

Then O
he O
would O
pour O
water O
all O
over O
him O
and O
kick O
the O
tortured O
to O
the O
brink O
of O
death O
, O
collapsed O
man O
, O
throw O
him O
into O
a O
tub O
full O
of O
ice O
cold O
water O
that O
was O
used O
to O
wash O
potatoes O
in O
January B-DATE
when O
it O
was O
freezing O
cold O
. O

Then O
, O
he O
kicked O
him O
out O
of O
the O
potato O
kitchen O
and O
let O
him O
return O
to O
the O
camp O
in O
freezing O
cold O
weather O
. O

Even O
the O
strongest O
and O
healthiest O
succumbed O
to O
pneumonia O
. O

For O
one O
soup O
we O
would O
volunteer O
in O
the O
evenings O
to O
clean O
up O
after O
100 O
potato O
and O
turnip O
peelers O
. O

Everything O
was O
worked O
out O
to O
torture O
us O
. O

We O
would O
cast O
countless O
hectoliters O
of O
water O
onto O
the O
floor O
and O
if O
the O
Pole B-LOC
or O
the O
SS O
would O
find O
a O
single O
potato O
peel O
they O
would O
order O
us O
to O
play O
sports O
. O

To O
the O
delight O
of O
the O
SSmen O
, O
they O
would O
get O
the O
kitchen O
prisoners O
to O
play O
the O
game O
with O
us O
. O

With O
a O
several O
kilo O
( O
5 O
- O
7 O
) O
heavy O
wooden O
object O
, O
they O
ordered O
the O
condemned O
to O
run O
around O
a O
cauldron O
. O

They O
had O
to O
perform O
certain O
drills O
, O
such O
as O
squats O
, O
nieder O
- O
auf O
, O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
back O
up O
. O

They O
made O
them O
exercise O
in O
front O
of O
the O
open O
fire O
in O
the O
cauldrons O
. O

If O
the O
prisoner O
fainted O
, O
they O
poured O
water O
on O
him O
and O
he O
would O
have O
to O
continue O
exercising O
while O
being O
severely O
beaten O
. O

Many O
people O
didn’t O
live O
much O
longer O
after O
this O
game O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
Fassung O
was O
also O
interesting O
. O

We O
would O
commute O
from O
the O
B O
II O
family O
camp O
to O
the O
Männerlager O
, O
where O
they O
handed O
out O
enough O
foodstuffs O
for O
a O
week O
for O
10,000 O
people O
from O
the O
camp O
to O
us O
. O

We O
traveled O
back O
yoked O
like O
horses O
, O
generally O
at O
a O
trot O
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
had O
to O
load O
bags O
of O
flour O
and O
other O
foodstuffs O
while O
we O
were O
continually O
whipped O
with O
canes O
. O

We O
had O
to O
load O
35 O
cents O
of O
flour O
onto O
the O
cart O
in O
5 O
minutes O
, O
which O
was O
unbelievably O
difficult O
for O
us O
, O
and O
then O
pull O
the O
cart O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
neighboring O
camp O
. O

The O
beatings O
were O
so O
cruel O
that O
prisoners O
would O
collapse O
under O
the O
cart O
and O
be O
run O
over O
by O
the O
heavily O
laden O
vehicle O
. O

They O
would O
end O
up O
with O
fractures O

internal O
bleeding O

no O

too O
, O
was O
transported O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Skarzysko B-CAMP
. O

There O
were O
3 O
large O
munitions O
plants O
there O
. O

In O
one O
of O
them O
, O
bombs O
and O
grenades O
were O
filled O
with O
TNT O
, O
which O
made O
people O
turn O
completely O
yellow O
in O
three O
weeks O
and O
die O
in O
three O
months O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
a O
factory O
that O
produced O
munitions O
and O
grenades O
. O

I O
worked O
an O
eight O
- O
hour O
shift O
. O

The O
work O
wasn’t O
very O
demanding O
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
continue O
working O
in O
the O
camp O
doing O
various O
jobs O
, O
and O
so O
we O
never O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
rest O
. O

We O
didn’t O
go O
hungry O
because O
we O
traded O
with O
the O
Poles O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
factory O
for O
various O
foodstuffs O
. O

We O
were O
housed O
in O
wooden O
buildings O
that O
were O
very O
dirty O
and O
infested O
with O
lice O
, O
bedbugs O
, O
mice O
, O
and O
fleas O
. O

Before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Russian B-ORG
Army I-ORG
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 B-DATE
, O
we O
were O
evacuated O
to O
Czestochowa B-CAMP
. O

There O
, O
conditions O
were O
similar O
to O
those O
in O
Skarzysko B-CAMP
, O
but O
the O
food O
was O
worse O
. O

In O
January B-DATE
1945 I-DATE
, O
when O
the O
Russians O
approached O
once O
again O
, O
we O
were O
evacuated O
to O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
. O

We O
had O
been O
able O
to O
keep O
our O
things O
with O
us O
up O
to O
then O
, O
but O
in O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
our O
clothes O
were O
removed O
, O
we O
were O
shaved O
, O
and O
we O
were O
given O
only O
a O
shirt O
, O
pants O
, O
a O
jacket O
, O
and O
shoes O
. O

Dressed O
in O
these O
clothes O
, O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
for O
2 O
- O
4 O
hours O
every O
day O
in O
the O
frost O
and O
snow O
during O
the O
roll O
call O
, O
while O
the O
prisoners O
told O
us O
that O
we O
were O
in O
a O
guest O
house O
since O
we O
didn’t O
have O
to O
work O
. O

The O
food O
wasn’t O
bad O
, O
but O
the O
housing O
was O
terrible O
. O

Six O
people O
slept O
in O
four O
- O
level O
bunks O
in O
a O
space O
that O
was O
1,5 O
m O
wide O
and O
2 O
m O
long O
. O

We O
spent O
only O
8 O
days O
in O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
. O

Then O
we O
went O
to O
Dora B-CAMP
. O

The O
camp O
was O
the O
same O
as O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
, O
except O
that O
we O
had O
to O
work O
in O
underground O
factories O
making O
V1 O
and O
V2 O
bombs O
. O

Here O
, O
too O
, O
we O
stayed O
for O
only O
8 O
days O
and O
then O
we O
went O
to O
Rottleberode B-CAMP
. O

This O
camp O
held O
1,600 O
people O
. O

Two O
SS O
officers O
led O
the O
camp O
, O
and O
they O
treated O
people O
, O
and O
especially O
the O
Jews O
( O
numbering O
about O
500 O
) O
, O
like O
animals O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
prisoners O
worked O
in O
the O
underground O
airplane O
factory O
there O
, O
while O
the O
rest O
drilled O
through O
the O
cliff O
to O
make O
space O
for O
a O
new O
factory O
. O

450 O
of O
us O
worked O
on O
the O
cliff O
, O
where O
the O
work O
was O
very O
hard O
and O
the O
Capo O
was O
ordered O
to O
return O
with O
at O
least O
three O
people O
beaten O
to O
death O
every O
day O
. O

Many O
people O
from O
this O
group O
died O
from O
exhaustion O
even O
though O
the O
food O
wasn’t O
bad O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
a O
group O
of O
50 O
people O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
assigned O
special O
tasks O
in O
the O
factory O
, O
but O
, O
for O
anti O
- O
semitic O
reasons O
, O
the O
Lagerführer O
let O
us O
perform O
the O
hardest O
tasks O
in O
the O
factory O
. O

He O
gave O
less O
and O
less O
food O
rations O
to O
Jews O
than O
to O
Aryans O
and O
we O
were O
constantly O
beaten O
. O

The O
factory O
administrator O
, O
who O
was O
somewhat O
objective O
, O
requested O
us O
for O
the O
factory O
, O
and O
, O
fortunately O
, O
we O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
factory O
. O

We O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
two O
- O
story O
building O
; O
500 O
people O
in O
a O
single O
large O
room O
; O
we O
slept O
two O
by O
two O
on O
a O
¾ O
m O
plank O
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
until O
the O
end O
of O
March B-DATE
1945 I-DATE
, O
when O
the O
surrounding O
cities O
were O
bombarded O
. O

We O
had O
to O
immediately O
set O
out O
at O
night O
on O
a O
march O
to O
the O
train O
. O

Our O
provisions O
consisted O
of O
only O
one O
loaf O
of O
bread O
and O
one O
can O
. O

For O
10 O
days O
, O
we O
rode O
back O
and O
forth O
from O
one O
front O
to O
another O
with O
almost O
no O
food O
, O
to O
say O
nothing O
of O
the O
hygienic O
conditions O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
we O
were O
shelled O
twice O
by O
the O
Americans O
. O

Several O
dozen O
people O
died O
, O
including O
SS O
officers O
. O

Each O
time O
we O
tried O
to O
escape O
, O
but O
every O
time O
the O
Volkssturm B-ORG
made O
that O
impossible O
. O

Although O
other O
transports O
were O
hooked O
up O
to O
us O
, O
our O
numbers O
diminished O
because O
people O
died O
of O
hunger O
. O

About O
10 O
days O
later O
, O
when O
the O
tracks O
were O
destroyed O
and O
the O
trains O
could O
no O
longer O
move O
on O
, O
we O
set O
out O
on O
a O
march O
through O
the O
forest O
. O

People O
who O
didn’t O
have O
the O
strength O
to O
walk O
any O
further O
were O
shot O
and O
all O
of O
us O
were O
close O
to O
making O
peace O
with O
death O
ourselves O
because O
we O
realized O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
hopeless O
— O
the O
SS O
officers O
didn’t O
have O
any O
idea O
about O
where O
to O
take O
us O
. O

After O
a O
two O
- O
day O
walk O
we O
had O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
on O
some O
sort O
of O
meadow O
and O
this O
is O
where O
I O
ran O
away O
together O
with O
my O
friend O
. O

Others O
ran O
away O
as O
well O
and O
when O
the O
SS O
officers O
realized O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
they O
shot O
at O
us O
. O

The O
two O
of O
us O
managed O
to O
run O
away O
to O
a O
forest O
that O
was O
5 O
km O
away O
. O

The O
others O
who O
ran O
with O
us O
and O
lagged O
behind O
were O
gunned O
down O
the O
next O
day O
by O
the O
Volkssturm B-ORG
. O

Only O
5 O
were O
saved O
. O

This O
was O
on O
April B-DATE
11th I-DATE
, I-DATE
1945 I-DATE
. O

The O
rest O
who O
didn’t O
run O
and O
continued O
marching O
the O
next O
day O
were O
ordered O
to O
dig O
a O
large O
grave O
, O
in O
which O
they O
would O
be O
buried O
after O
they O
were O
shot O
. O

But O
then O
a O
car O
arrived O
with O
higher O
ranked O
SS O
officers O
who O
issued O
another O
order O
: O
everyone O
was O
herded O
into O
a O
large O
barn O
. O

They O
were O
given O
food O
and O
then O
the O
barn O
was O
set O
on O
fire O
. O

The O
prisoners O
put O
the O
fire O
out O
with O
their O
jackets O
, O
but O
the O
barn O
was O
set O
on O
fire O
again O
and O
surrounded O
by O
SS O
officers O
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

Those O
who O
tried O
to O
escape O
were O
shot O
. O

4 O
prisoners O
jumped O
into O
a O
cement O
well O
, O
but O
had O
to O
climb O
out O
because O
the O
fire O
was O
so O
great O
. O

3 O
of O
them O
were O
shot O
and O
one O
was O
saved O
but O
suffered O
burns O
to O
his O
legs O
. O

5 O
hours O
later O
, O
the O
Americans O
arrived O
. O

All O
1,163 O
prisoners O
died O
there O
. O

This O
was O
in O
Gardelegen B-LOC
in O
Harz B-LOC
. O

The O
two O
of O
us O
walked O
only O
at O
night O
( O
we O
were O
dressed O
in O
striped O
clothes O
) O
in O
a O
westward O
direction O
, O
but O
the O
next O
day O
we O
realized O
that O
we O
had O
to O
make O
it O
to O
a O
village O
or O
we O
would O
starve O
to O
death O
. O

We O
emerged O
onto O
a O
road O
and O
found O
a O
case O
containing O
German O
uniforms O
. O

We O
put O
them O
on O
and O
happily O
arrived O
in O
the O
village O
pretending O
to O
be O
Germans O
. O

We O
were O
given O
food O
and O
were O
told O
where O
the O
Americans O
were O
and O
where O
the O
Germans O
were O
. O

I O
remember O
two O
transports O
: O
one O
in O
March O
and O
one O
in O
April O
. O

I O
can O
say O
very O
little O
about O
the O
March O
transport O
. O

The O
people O
had O
inadequate O
clothing O
, O
frozen O
limbs O
, O
no O
luggage O
and O
said O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
Bavaria O
. O

They O
were O
accompanied O
by O
SS O
guards O
. O

Around O
April O
24 O
, O
a O
transport O
of O
women O
and O
men O
arrived O
at O
the O
monastery O
and O
demanded O
accommodation O
for O
the O
night O
and O
potatoes O
. O

The O
people O
were O
in O
terrible O
condition O
. O

They O
were O
split O
up O
into O
different O
barns O
and O
I O
started O
to O
cook O
for O
them O
. O

Some O
women O
helped O
me O
. O

During O
the O
conversation O
I O
learned O
that O
they O
were O
on O
the O
transport O
from O
Silesia O
to O
Bavaria O
. O

The O
treatment O
was O
twofold O
: O
a O
guard O
waited O
until O
late O
in O
the O
night O
until O
all O
the O
food O
was O
cooked O
and O
did O
not O
go O
to O
sleep O
until O
all O
the O
people O
were O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

It O
was O
an O
older O
gentleman O
whose O
name O
I O
did O
not O
remember O
. O

He O
stated O
that O
he O
had O
only O
accepted O
the O
task O
of O
overseer O
against O
his O
will O
and O
expressed O
his O
intention O
to O
leave O
the O
transport O
soon O
. O

He O
loathed O
the O
violence O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
very O
popular O
with O
the O
inmates O
. O

Another O
on O
the O
contrary O
struck O
and O
scolded O
even O
the O
women O
. O

I O
felt O
obliged O
to O
give O
him O
a O
reprimand O
, O
and O
he O
turned O
against O
me O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
we O
know O
nothing O
about O
it O
in O
the O
monastery O

Mr O

Fürst B-PERS
, O
who O
has O
been O
studying O
the O
history O
of O
Březnice B-LOC
very O
closely O
, O
takes O
this O
to O
mean O
that O
Jews O
have O
been O
living O
in O
Březnice B-LOC
since O
the O
year O
1500 B-DATE
and O
have O
been O
burying O
their O
dead O
in O
the O
place O
where O
there O
is O
now O
a O
Jewish O
cemetery O
, O
although O
at O
the O
time O
the O
place O
was O
not O
marked O
as O
a O
cemetery O
. O

The O
cemetery O
consists O
of O
two O
connected O
sections O
. O

The O
older O
section O
has O
about O
270 O
gravestones O
, O
many O
of O
them O
with O
illegible O
markings O
, O
and O
the O
newer O
section O
has O
about O
150 O
gravestones O
. O

In O
the O
older O
section O
, O
there O
is O
an O
area O
without O
any O
gravestones O
. O

Burials O
have O
not O
taken O
place O
there O
in O
a O
long O
time O
because O
nobody O
knows O
whether O
there O
was O
even O
a O
burial O
ground O
there O
in O
the O

Burials O
took O
place O

the O
new O
section O

the O
Jews O

When O
the O

crowds O

went O
to O

the O
cruel O
actions O

the O

There O
is O
also O
a O

is O
in O
a O
pitiful O
state O
after O

Finally O
, O
it O
should O
be O
mentioned O
that O
the O
bibliographical O
material O
promised O
by O
the O
clients O
was O
not O
sent O
: O
only O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
work O
were O
relevant O
works O
selected O
from O
the O
continuous O
material O
and O
used O
for O
cataloging O
. O

How O
inadequate O
the O
apparatus O
remained O
despite O
all O
efforts O
becomes O
clear O
when O
it O
is O
mentioned O
that O

As O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
commission O
outlined O
above O
, O
dealing O
with O
the O
material O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
divided O
into O
two O
main O
parts O
: O
the O
precise O
cataloging O
of O
the O
works O
written O
in O
Hebrew O
script O
and O
language O
, O
and O
the O
classification O
of O
the O
remaining O
material O
according O
to O
special O
areas O
, O
i. O
e. O
manuscripts O
that O
were O
only O
briefly O

Hebrew O

, O
other O

and O
works O
. O

All O
the O
material O
was O
in O
581 O
boxes O
, O
which O
were O
successively O
brought O
to O
the O
work O
site O
, O
where O
they O
were O
either O
set O
out O
for O
cataloging O
or O
, O
if O
the O
order O
did O
not O
refer O
to O
them O
, O
counted O
and O
repacked O
. O

Since O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
the O
boxes O
were O
in O
a O
condition O
that O
made O
further O
use O
impossible O
and O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
box O
material O
, O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
pack O
extensive O
series O
works O
in O
bundles O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
existing O
crates O
had O
to O
be O
used O
in O
a O
much O
more O
economical O
way O
by O
packing O
the O
largest O
possible O
number O
of O
books O
as O
compared O
to O
what O
was O
often O
the O
case O
with O
the O

A O

Jews O
are O
being O
seriously O
persecuted O
by O
the O
Nazi O
regime O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
exaggeration O
to O
say O
that O
those O
fellow O
[ O
Jews O
] O
living O
in O
Germany B-LOC
are O
suffering O
from O
tremendous O
hardship O
. O

This O
time O
when O
they O
left O
Germany O
their O
properties O
were O
confiscated O
and O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
bring O
funds O
or O
clothing O
… O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
anti O
- O
semitic O
measures O
are O
becoming O
more O
stringent O
in O
administration O
and O
that O
anti O
- O
semitic O
propaganda O
increases O
upon O
the O
eastern O
front O
. O

This O
activity O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
encouraged O
by O
those O
Romanians O
who O
have O
benefited O
from O
the O
confiscations O
of O
Jewish O
property O
and O
their O
forced O

... O
] O
The O
question O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
and O
the O
war O
against O
Soviet O
Russia O
are O
linked O
together O
, O
as O
in O
all O
Axis O
States O

This O
attitude O
is O
claimed O
by O
competent O
observers O
to O
be O
greatly O
encouraged O
by O
the O
Romanian O
aristocrats O
, O
business O
and O
professional O
men O
, O
who O
are O
behind O
the O
Government O
in O
this O
attempt O
. O

The O
explanation O
offered O
for O
the O
support O
of O
these O
classes O
to O
anti O
- O
semitic O
propaganda O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
are O
the O
chief O
beneficiaries O
of O
the O

of O

I O
came O

from O
the O

camp O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
to O
the O
newly O
- O
established O
concentration O
camp O
Melk B-CAMP
. O

The O
then- O
camp O
leader O
was O
SS O
Untersturmführer O
Toni B-PERS
Streitwieser I-PERS
. O

After O
about O
14 O
days O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
the O
camp O
leadership O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
SS O
- O
Obersturmführer O
Julius B-PERS
Ludolph I-PERS
. O

Ludolph B-PERS
was O
a O
native O
of O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
by O
profession O
, O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
, O
a O
taxi O
driver O
. O

In O
his O
behavior O
towards O
the O
inmates O
he O
did O
not O
differ O
from O
his O
predecessor O
SS O
- O
Untersturmführer O
Streitwieser B-PERS
. O

About O
five O
days O
after O
taking O
over O
the O
camp O
, O
Ludolph B-PERS
made O
me O
a O
camp O
recorder O
for O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
camp O
. O

General O
information O
about O
Ludolph B-PERS
! O
At O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
inmates O
Ludolph B-PERS
led O
a O
high O
life O
, O
which O
can O
hardly O
be O
described O
in O
words O
. O

From O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
inmates O
, O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O
SS O
troops O
’ O
kitchen O
, O
he O
took O
the O
best O
meat O
and O
other O
food O
every O
day O
. O

From O
the O
inmates O
’ O
canteen O
he O
stole O
cigarettes O
in O
large O
quantities O
. O

He O
could O
not O
use O
all O
these O
quantities O
of O
food O
and O
cigarettes O
himself O
. O

He O
sold O
this O
product O
to O
civilians O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
wine O
and O
other O
alcoholic O
beverages O
. O

Even O
poultry O
and O
other O
things O
, O
only O
ration O
cards O
and O
dress O
cards O
he O
exchanged O
for O
things O
stolen O
from O
the O
inmates O
. O

The O
extent O
of O
his O
extravagant O
lifestyle O
with O
different O
women O
every O
day O
sometimes O
led O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
an O
ill O
person O
. O

But O
time O
and O
again O
, O
I O
came O
to O
realize O
that O
Ludolph B-PERS
is O
fully O
responsible O
for O
his O
actions O
. O

Even O
though O
some O
of O
his O
brutalities O
against O
inmates O
were O
committed O
while O
drunk O
, O
he O
proved O
, O
as O
I O
later O
record O
, O
that O
essentially O
everything O
he O
did O
was O
utterly O
premeditated O
. O

In O
detail O
, O
I O
will O
describe O
a O
number O
of O
cases O
that O
are O
fresh O
in O
my O
memory O
that O
prove O
that O
Ludolph B-PERS
is O
certainly O
responsible O
for O
the O
brutality O
of O
his O
atrocities O
. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
mention O
in O
passing O
that O
he O
repeatedly O
beat O
me O
over O
my O
head O
and O
face O
with O
a O
stick O
and O
broke O
my O
upper O
jaw O
. O

The O
entire O
camp O
, O
which O
had O
meanwhile O
grown O
to O
more O
than O
10,000 O
inmates O
, O
trembled O
when O
Ludolph B-PERS
came O
to O
the O
camp O
. O

There O
was O
a O
Order O
Regarding O
Prisoners O
, O
according O
to O
which O
the O
beating O
of O
inmates O
in O
labour O
camps O
/ O
Melk B-CAMP
had O
been O
declared O
a O
labour O
camp O
/ O
was O
forbidden O
. O

Ludolph B-PERS
ignored O
this O
rule O
without O
a O
thought O
. O

He O
left O
the O
whole O
camp O
to O
stand O
at O
roll O
call O
in O
the O
worst O
weather O
/rain O
and O
frost/ O
for O
hours O
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
. O

The O
inmates O
could O
find O
no O
rest O
this O
way O
. O

No O
sooner O
had O
they O
received O
their O
food O
, O
barren O
even O
for O
prison O
food O
, O
then O
he O
drove O
the O
inmates O
to O
work O
with O
a O
bru- O
tality O
that O
was O
certainly O
responsible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
deceased O
inmates O
. O

Inmates O
who O
reported O
that O
they O
were O
ill O
at O
roll O
call O
were O
beaten O
by O
him O
and O
his O
accomplice O
SS O
- O
Scharführer O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
. O

Repeatedly O
, O
inmates O
who O
reported O
that O
they O
were O
ill O
were O
beaten O
by O
Ludolph B-PERS
and O
were O
delivered O
to O
the O
camp O
hospital O
dead O
. O

People O
were O
systematically O
exterminated O
! O
! O
! O
I O
remember O
the O
following O
case O
: O
Bratislava B-LOC
was O
cleared O
, O
the O
inmates O
held O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
were O
transported O
by O
lorry O
and O
were O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
. O

According O
to O
the O
detainees O
, O
the O
proceedings O
against O
them O
were O
by O
no O
means O
complete O
. O

Not O
one O
inmate O
had O
received O
a O
court O
order O
or O
an O
order O
of O
protective O
custody O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

The O
transport O
of O
the O
inmates O
from O
Bratislava B-LOC
took O
place O
by O
lorry O
. O

This O
lorry O
operation O
was O
attacked O
by O
low O
- O
flying O
aircraft O
in O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
area O
, O
probably O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
it O
was O
a O
military O
transport O
. O

The O
detainees O
were O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
jump O
off O
the O
vehicle O
and O
seek O
shelter O
in O
the O
ditches O
. O

On O
this O
occasion O
, O
31 O
inmates O
were O
shot O
and O
brought O
to O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
camp O
in O
this O
wounded O
condition O
. O

Besides O
these O
wounded O
there O
were O
also O
some O
dead O
and O
more O
than O
160 O
who O
had O
remained O
intact O
and O
were O
delivered O
to O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
dead O
were O
then O
immediately O
burned O
in O
the O
camp O
crematorium O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
not O
injured O
were O
transported O
on O
to O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
by O
lorry O
the O
same O
evening O
. O

The O
then O
- O
Luftwaffe O
camp O
physician O
, O
commanded O
against O
his O
will O
to O
work O
at O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
camp O
, O
whom O
all O
inmates O
have O
much O
to O
thank O
, O
oversaw O
the O
situation O
and O
put O
16 O
of O
the O
31 O
wounded O
inmates O
on O
the O
transport O
to O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
. O

The O
following O
night O
, O
Ludolph B-PERS
[ O
ordered O
] O
the O
SS O
- O
Scharführer O
Muzikant B-PERS
, O
who O
had O
been O
deployed O
in O
the O
area O
, O
to O
kill O
the O
15 O
remaining O
wounded O
inmates O
from O
the O
Pressburg B-LOC
transport O
after O
roll O
call O
. O

The O
murderer O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
carried O
out O
this O
order O
with O
deliberation O
and O
joy O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
when O
the O
camp O
physician O
came O
into O
the O
area O
, O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
informed O
him O
that O
the O
15 O
inmates O
had O
died O
. O

The O
camp O
physician O
came O
to O
me O
in O
the O
writing O
office O
and O
told O
me O
about O
the O
incident O
. O

Disgust O
and O
revulsion O
overcame O
him O
and O
again O
and O
again O
he O
asked O
how O
he O
got O
out O
of O
having O
been O
commandeered O
as O
camp O
physician O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
is O
my O
duty O
to O
ask O
the O
camp O
physician O
Dr O
. O

Sora B-PERS
to O
do O
nothing O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
his O
removal O
from O
the O
camp O
. O

How O
right O
I O
was O
in O
this O
is O
proved O
by O
the O
following O
incident O
: O
In O
April B-DATE
of O
this O
year O
, O
when O
the O
Russians B-LOC
had O
already O
taken O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
were O
on O
the O
march O
towards O
St B-CAMP
. I-CAMP

Pölten I-CAMP
, O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
camp O
was O
to O
be O
evacuated O
. O

The O
Lagerführer O
Ludolph B-PERS
wanted O
to O
thwart O
the O
evacuation O
of O
the O
camp O
. O

He O
intended O
, O
as O
he O
announced O
at O
an O
SS O
leaders O
meeting O
, O
to O
drive O
all O
the O
inmates O
to O
work O
places O
in O
the O
tunnels O
located O
there O
and O
then O
to O
blow O
the O
tunnels O
and O
the O
1,000 O
inmates O
into O
the O
air O
. O

Blasting O
devices O
were O
already O
installed O
and O
ready O
. O

I O
learned O
of O
this O
criminal O
attack O
through O
the O
aforementioned O
camp O
physician O
Dr O
. O

Sora B-PERS
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
Sturmmann O
employed O
in O
the O
inmate O
kitchen O
Toni B-PERS
Hefner I-PERS
. O

All O
inmates O
were O
informed O
by O
me O
and O
told O
to O
not O
enter O
the O
tunnels O
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

I O
discussed O
the O
situation O
with O
the O
camp O
physician O
Dr O
. O

Sora B-PERS
and O
asked O
him O
to O
inform O
the O
district O
administrator O
in O
his O
capacity O
as O
a O
police O
authority O
and O
request O
that O
his O
superiors O
be O
instructed O
to O
forbid O
Ludolph B-PERS
to O
carry O
out O
his O
criminal O
attack O
. O

Ludolph B-PERS
did O
indeed O
receive O
the O
telegraphic O
order O
not O
to O
blow O
up O
the O
tunnel O
. O

When O
, O
after O
a O
few O
days O
, O
the O
camp O
was O
evacuated O
and O
we O
inmates O
were O
transported O
to O
the O
Ebensee B-CAMP
camp O
in O
various O
transports O
, O
Ludolph B-PERS
was O
there O
again O
, O
and O
with O
his O
accomplice O
Musikant B-PERS
. O

Muzikant O
He O
wanted O
to O
kill O
, O
aka O
murder O
, O
inmates O
who O
were O
in O
the O
infirmary O
and O
suffering O
from O
a O
slight O
infectious O
disease O
/Eresypela/ O
, O
who O
were O
inconvenient O
to O
him O
to O
evacuate O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
inmates O
working O
in O
the O
camp O
hospital O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
rescue O
5 O
of O
these O
ill O
inmates O
by O
exchanging O
5 O
inmates O
who O
had O
died O
of O
general O
injuries O
against O
5 O
infectious O
inmates O
. O

As O
we O
tried O
to O
rescue O
the O
last O
two O
inmates O
, O
both O
of O
them O
had O
been O
hung O
by O
nooses O
in O
their O
beds O
by O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
on O
Ludolph B-PERS
’ O
s O
orders O
. O

Another O
case O
of O
the O
systematic O
annihilation O
or O
extermination O
of O
the O
inmates O
: O
SS O
- O
Scharführer O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
mistakenly O
reported O
an O
inmate O
as O
dead O
to O
the O
main O
camp O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
. O

During O
the O
evacuation O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
I O
discovered O
this O
error O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
existing O
personnel O
cards O
. O

I O
reported O
this O
to O
the O
Rapportführer O
SS O
- O
Oberscharführer O
Curt B-PERS
Jansson I-PERS
Jansen O
, O
who O
presented O
it O
to O
camp O
leader O
Ludolph B-PERS
and O
asked O
for O
advice O
and O
instructions O
. O

Then O
Ludolph B-PERS
tells O
Jansson B-PERS
Jansen O
to O
tell O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
to O
just O
kill O
the O
inmate O
, O
who O
was O
still O
alive O
and O
in O
the O
camp O
hospital O
, O
/a O
Frenchman B-LOC
named O
Blankart B-PERS
/ O
so O
that O
no O
further O
correspondence O
with O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
would O
be O
necessary O
. O

Jansson B-PERS
Jansen O
whispered O
this O
into O
Musikant B-PERS
’s I-PERS
Muzikant O
ear O
in O
my O
presence O
, O
but O
he O
said O
it O
loudly O
enough O
that O
I O
could O
hear O
it O
. O

I O
immediately O
discussed O
what O
I O
had O
heard O
with O
the O
inmate O
who O
worked O
with O
me O
in O
the O
writing O
office O
Antonius B-PERS
Pichon I-PERS
/ O
Frenchman B-LOC
/. O
Pichon B-PERS
and O
I O
then O
hid O
the O
Frenchman B-LOC
Blankart B-PERS
in O
the O
writing O
office O
and O
then O
later O
in O
our O
living O
quarters O
, O
and O
then O
, O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
sent O
him O
on O
a O
transport O
to O
Ebensee B-CAMP
. O

We O
explained O
to O
Ludolph B-PERS
and O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
that O
Blankart B-PERS
had O
passed O
away O
, O
which O
pleased O
and O
satisfied O
both O
of O
them O
. O

In O
order O
to O
systematically O
document O
all O
of O
the O
bestialities O
that O
were O
systematically O
carried O
out O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
Ludolph B-PERS
and O
his O
criminal O
satellites O
, O
I O
would O
need O
so O
much O
paper O
that O
a O
book O
could O
be O
filled O
with O
it O
. O

I O
have O
to O
mention O
, O
however O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
to O
chastise O
inmates O
who O
had O
been O
accused O
of O
trivialities O
and O
not O
been O
proven O
guilty O
of O
anything O
with O
blows O
. O

Chastisement O
was O
carried O
out O
by O
attaching O
the O
inmate O
to O
a O
specially O
made O
block O
of O
wood O
and O
then O
, O
at O
Ludolph B-PERS
’ O
s O
discretion O
or O
when O
he O
was O
absent O
, O
through O
one O
of O
his O
ragged O
satellites O
, O
beating O
the O
inmate O
with O
25 O
blows O
or O
more O
, O
up O
to O
100 O
blows O
, O
over O
the O
buttocks O
, O
back O
and O
head O
. O

Many O
inmates O
died O
as O
a O
result O
of O
these O
beatings O
. O

Inmates O
who O
collapsed O
unconscious O
as O
a O
result O
of O
general O
body O
weakness O
during O
labour O
commandos O
were O
kicked O
in O
the O
meanest O
way O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
inmates O
who O
died O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
treatment O
, O
and O
continued O
to O
be O
kicked O
and O
beaten O
when O
they O
were O
already O
dead O
. O

Before O
concluding O
my O
report O
, O
which O
contains O
only O
a O
small O
selection O
of O
what O
occurred O
under O
the O
camp O
leadership O
of O
and O
with O
the O
fullest O
agreement O
of O
Ludolph B-PERS
, O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
forget O
the O
following O
incident O
: O
When O
the O
concentration O
camp O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
was O
evacuated O
, O
it O
was O
more O
than O
20 O
° O
C O
below O
and O
the O
inmates O
were O
transported O
in O
open O
train O
cars O
, O
10 O
days O
without O
food O
. O

Several O
hundred O
inmates O
died O
in O
this O
transport O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
cold O
and O
food O
. O

Various O
inmates O
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
transport O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
inmates O
were O
picked O
up O
by O
the O
police O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
Melk B-CAMP
camp O
. O

Completely O
exhausted O
, O
the O
inmates O
arrived O
at O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
camp O
physician O
ordered O
their O
immediate O
admission O
to O
the O
camp O
hospital O
. O

He O
personally O
ensured O
that O
the O
inmates O
were O
in O
the O
camp O
hospital O
and O
prescribed O
the O
necessary O
treatments O
for O
their O
physical O
condition O
. O

After O
the O
camp O
physician O
had O
left O
the O
camp O
, O
the O
most O
notorious O
SS O
-Scharführer O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
put O
these O
3 O
physically O
weak O
inmates O
into O
the O
camp O
hospital O
’ O
s O
corpse O
cellar O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
dead O
inmates O
already O
stored O
there O
. O

He O
then O
took O
a O
large O
hypodermic O
syringe O
, O
filled O
it O
with O
petrol O
, O
and O
stabbed O
the O
syringe O
into O
each O
of O
the O
three O
inmates O
’ O
hearts O
, O
resulting O
in O
immediate O
death O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
with O
friends O
, O
he O
reported O
his O
shameful O
act O
to O
the O
Lagerführer O
, O
who O
in O
turn O
congratulated O
Musikant B-PERS
Muzikant O
on O
the O
act O
. O

In O
my O
capacity O
as O
a O
camp O
recorder O
, O
I O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
be O
present O
for O
all O
these O
conversations O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
judge O
, O
I O
just O
establish O
the O
facts O
and O
leave O
it O
up O
to O
the O
competent O
authority O
to O
pass O
judgment O
on O
the O
hopefully O
soon O

to O
- O
be O
- O
captured O

The O

in O

with O
particular O
inhumanity O

I O

I O
must O
note O
that O
Ludolph B-PERS

when O

In O
response O
( O

# O
34 O
of O
June B-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
) O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Foreign O
Affairs O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
it O
should O
not O
make O
Jews O
into O
a O
question O
. O

Since O
then O
in O
many O
countries O
in O
Europe B-LOC
persecution O
of O
Jews O
has O
worsened O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
is O
the O
same O
even O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
been O
considered O
their O
paradise O
/ O
haven O
. O

Therefore O
, O
when O
the O
war O
is O
over O
, O
many O
of O
the O
Jews O
will O
leave O
Europe B-LOC
and O
in O
that O
case O
we O
should O
pay O
attention O
so O
that O
they O
don’t O
flow O
into O
Greater O
East O
Asia O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
while O
building O
Greater O
East O
Asia O
, O
from O
now O
on O
we O
need O
to O
diligently O
pay O
close O
attention O
so O
as O
to O
eliminate O
the O
Jewish O
influence O
entrenched O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
East O
Asia O
starting O
from O
Shanghai B-LOC
to O
the O
extent O
possible O
and O
to O
eradicate O
their O
foundation O

At O
the O
present O
they O
are O
bound O
to O
engage O
in O
Fifth O
Column O
type O
of O
activities O
for O
the O

so O
we O
need O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
all O
Jews O
regardless O

that O
he O
only O
cut O

because O
in O

The O
victims O
were O
15 O

Among O
them O
were O
Shimshi B-PERS

Only O
a O

in O
the O

The O
experiments O
were O
made O
as O

The O
girls O
were O
placed O
in O
ultra O

high O
- O
wave O
fields O
by O
attaching O
electrodes O
to O
their O
stomachs O

with O

directed O
at O
the O

As O
a O
result O
of O

severe O
burns O

ulcers O
developed O
on O
the O
abdomen O

A O

After O
three O
months O
they O

brought O
back O

operations O
were O
carried O
out O

The O
girls O
had O
their O
genitals O

their O
condition O
. O

The O
girls O
were O
completely O
changed O
and O
looked O
like O
old O
women O
, O
probably O
due O
to O
a O
lack O

He O
worked O
in O

the O
chemist O
Dr B-PERS

Möbel I-PERS
from O

The O
aim O
of O
their O
experiments O
was O
to O
find O
new O
contrast O
media O
for O
X O
- O
ray O
photography O
to O
replace O
iodipine O
, O
which O
could O
no O

Klauberg B-PERS
was O
primarily O
a O
businessman O
, O
he O
worked O
on O

of O
the O
German O
chemical O
industry O
and O
received O
a O
considerable O
sum O
of O
money O
for O
every O
woman O
used O
for O
experiments O
. O

On O
the O
X O
- O
ray O
table O
, O
cement O
- O
like O
thick O
liquid O
was O
introduced O

the O

’s O
uterus O

with O
an O
electric O
pump O
under O
X O

ray O
control O
, O
and O
then O
the O
photograph O
was O
taken O
. O

The O
women O
suffered O
greatly O
from O
these O
injections O
and O
felt O
as O
if O
their O
stomachs O
were O
about O
to O
burst O
. O

After O
injection O
, O
the O
women O
then O
excreted O
what O
had O
been O
injected O
into O
them O
, O
with O
severe O
pain O
and O
often O
heavy O
bleeding O
. O

Such O
experiments O

carried O
out O
3 O

6 O
times O
on O
the O
same O
women O
with O
breaks O
of O
3 O
- O
4 O
weeks O
. O

Those O
women O
on O
whom O
the O

were O
sent O

such O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
high O

was O
pressed O
into O

, O
the O

no O
other O
way O
to O
solve O
this O
question O
except O
by O
the O
plan O
proposed O
. O

The O
families O
with O
many O
children O
cannot O
be O
sent O
to O
Argentine B-LOC
as O
First O
Class O
Tourists O
as O
the O
expense O
would O
be O
ar O
too O
great O
, O
for O
each O
person O
11,500 O
Crowns O
, O
a O
family O
of O
six O
persons O
costing O
about O
Five O
hundred O
pounds O
sterling O
. O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
on O
board O
the O
tug O
is O
worse O
than O
anyone O
can O
imagine O
, O
as O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
enclosed O
copy O
of O
letter O
received O
by O
us O
and O
also O
from O
what O
Mrs O

Schmolka B-PERS
saw O
when O
she O
visited O
them O
on O
board O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
under O
the O
cirumstances O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
cannot O
accept O
sole O
responsibility O
for O
these O
poor O
people O
but O
must O
pass O
some O
on O
to O
the O
shoulders O
of O
Jewry O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Hoping O
to O
hear O
from O
you O
in O
the O
very O
near O
future O
that O
you O
have O
used O
your O

this O

We O
remain O

1943 I-DATE
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
This O
black O
day O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
's I-GHETTO
history O
actually O
had O
a O
long O
and O
treacherous O
prologue O
. O

Weeks O
before O
, O
the O
SS O
had O
suddenly O
stated O
that O
, O
according O
to O
their O
statistics O
of O
the O
population O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
50 O
people O
were O
missing O
. O

Heads O
of O
the O
relevant O
departments O
were O
arrested O
and O
frequently O
interrogated O
the O
Jewish O
Elder O
at O
the O
time O
, O
Jacob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
. O

The O
agitation O
among O
the O
population O
was O
great O
, O
for O
it O
was O
known O
that O
such O
a O
situation O
was O
enough O
to O
prompt O
new O
transports O
to O
the O
dreaded O
East O
. O

When O
Edelstein B-PERS
saw O
that O
the O
arrests O
among O
the O
senior O
civil O
servants O
were O
beginning O
to O
have O
increasingly O
wide O
- O
ranging O
consequences O
, O
he O
simply O
took O
the O
blame O
on O
himself O
and O
did O
not O
return O
from O
interrogation O
one O
day O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
was O
, O
it O
is O
safe O
to O
say O
, O
the O
most O
beloved O
and O
popular O
man O
in O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

, O
and O
there O
were O
only O
a O
few O
people O
who O
disagreed O
with O
him O
. O

His O
arrest O
hit O
us O
like O
a O
bomb O
and O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
say O
what O
was O
greater O
, O
the O
grief O
or O
the O
agitation O
. O

Even O
while O
Edelstein B-PERS
was O
in O
custody O
, O
the O
SS O
ordered O
a O
census O
of O
the O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

population O
, O
which O
was O
then O
about O
50,000 O
people O
. O

The O
whole O
population O
was O
ordered O
/ O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
seriously O
ill O
and O
feverish O
/ O
to O
assemble O
in O
a O
field O
outside O
of O
the O
fortifications O
of O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

, O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Bauschowitzer B-LOC
Kessel I-LOC
. O

At O
6 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
in O
each O
barracks O
, O
in O
each O
block O
, O
people O
were O
ordered O
to O
assemble O
in O
the O
courtyard O
and O
to O
move O
towards O
the O
Bauschowitzer B-LOC
Kessel I-LOC
, O
organized O
by O
barracks O
or O
block O
s. O
Just O
imagine O
: O
50,000 O
people O
. O

Young O
and O
old O
, O
mothers O
with O
children O
in O
their O
arms O
, O
or O
in O
prams O
, O
old O
people O
who O
could O
barely O
drag O
themselves O
out O
, O
everyone O
had O
to O
come O
out O
. O

Assembly O
in O
the O
courtyard O
was O
at O
6 O
o'clock O
and O
we O
proceeded O
to O
line O
up O
on O
the O
street O
in O
rows O
. O

There O
you O
stood O
in O
the O
side O
street O
until O
8 O
o'clock O
and O
saw O
everyone O
ahead O
of O
you O
in O
the O
rows O
pass O
, O
going O
down O
the O
main O
street O
. O

The O
November O
morning O
was O
cold O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
old O
people O
, O
who O
did O
not O
know O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
, O
with O
their O
folding O
chairs O
and O
bread O
bags O
and O
poor O
clothes O
, O
only O
made O
the O
shivering O
in O
the O
cold O
even O
worse O
. O

After O
8 O
o'clock O
our O
barracks O
arrived O
in O
the O
field O
, O
where O
about O
30,000 O
people O
had O
already O
gathered O
. O

Mothers O
with O
baby O
carriages O
formed O
a O
column O
. O

One O
was O
led O
to O
the O
designated O
place O
, O
which O
was O
marked O
with O
a O
number O
on O
a O
wooden O
sign O
rammed O
into O
the O
ground O
and O
… O
waited O
. O

Stood O
and O
waited O
. O

It O
was O
10 O
o'clock O
and O
it O
was O
11 O
o'clock O
and O
it O
was O
12 O
o'clock O
and O
nothing O
happened O
. O

The O
wide O
field O
was O
surrounded O
by O
Czech B-LOC
gendarmes O
, O
who O
stood O
very O
close O
together O
in O
places O
, O
so O
that O
in O
places O
you O
could O
not O
see O
between O
them O
. O

One O
got O
hungry O
and O
ate O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
/ O
that O
day O
we O
cooked O
in O
the O
communal O
kitchens O
/ O
, O
but O
it O
was O
worse O
when O
one O
had O
to O
take O
care O
of O
human O
needs O
. O

No O
turning O
, O
no O
leaving O
, O
no O
hiding O
. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
done O
wherever O
you O
stood O
, O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
in O
front O
of O
everyone O
and O
above O
all O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
gendarmerie O
. O

Finally O
, O
at O
3 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
the O
rattle O
of O
motorcycles O
and O
cars O
, O
the O
SS O
is O
here O
. O

The O
counting O
began O
. O

As O
if O
the O
agitation O
hadn’t O
been O
great O
enough O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
it O
was O
heightened O
by O
the O
arbitrariness O
and O
sadistic O
treatment O
of O
the O
Jews O
by O
the O
SS O
while O
counting O
. O

Each O
column O
of O
1000 O
persons O
had O
a O
responsible O
person O
. O

If O
this O
column O
did O
not O
add O
up O
or O
if O
the O
SS O
man O
was O
mistaken O
, O
then O
the O
person O
concerned O
not O
only O
got O
the O
order O
to O
slap O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
also O
beaten O
by O
the O
SS O
man O
or O
else O
he O
was O
ordered O
to O
slap O
another O
Jew O
. O

Finally O
, O
about O
5 O
o'clock O
, O
it O
was O
getting O
dark O
, O
again O
the O
rattling O
of O
the O
motorcycles O
, O
the O
SS O
left O
. O

And O
we O
keep O
standing O
in O
the O
open O
field O
, O
completely O
frozen O
with O
agitation O
, O
hungry O
and O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
break O
ranks O
and O
sit O
on O
the O
cold O
, O
wet O
ground O
/it O
began O
to O
rain O
/. O
Of O
course O
, O
many O
did O
so O
because O
their O
feet O
just O
could O
not O
stand O
anymore O
. O

And O
one O
stood O
or O
sat O
and O
waited O
for O
permission O
from O
the O
SS O
to O
leave O
the O
field O
and O
go O
home O
. O

But O
it O
was O
6 O
and O
it O
was O
7 O
o'clock O
and O
no O
permission O
came O
. O

People O
were O
seized O
by O
an O
indescribable O
agitation O
, O
especially O
the O
older O
people O
could O
not O
be O
calmed O
down O
. O

One O
expected O
the O
worst O
. O

Children O
started O
to O
cry O
, O
they O
were O
tired O
, O
frozen O
and O
hungry O
and O
the O
mothers O
were O
helpless O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
they O
could O
do O
was O
to O
lay O
down O
with O
the O
children O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
protect O
them O
from O
the O
cold O
and O
the O
increasingly O
heavy O
rain O
with O
their O
own O
bodies O
. O

The O
boys O
formed O
circles O
- O
one O
in O
the O
other O
, O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
at O
least O
the O
weaker O
ones O
, O
and O
to O
drive O
out O
the O
despair O
, O
some O
began O
to O
sing O
. O

But O
this O
was O
immediately O
forbidden O
by O
the O
leaders O
, O
who O
were O
nervous O
and O
unhappy O
themselves O
. O

Finally O
, O
at O
9:30 O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
permission O
to O
leave O
the O
field O
came O
. O

The O
order O
was O
to O
let O
children O
and O
mothers O
go O
first O
, O
but O
the O
crowd O
was O
so O
large O
/ O
we O
could O
only O
use O
a O
narrow O
dirt O
road O
on O
the O
road O
that O
led O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
and O
were O
very O
closely O
guarded O
/ O
that O
it O
was O
literally O
life O
- O
threatening O
to O
be O
in O
the O
squeezing O
, O
pushing O
, O
screaming O
mass O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
about O
10 O
o'clock O
that O
the O
crowd O
eased O
a O
bit O
and O
then O
the O
real O
work O
began O
for O
those O
for O
whom O
helping O
was O
the O
first O
commandment O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
old O
people O
simply O
could O
not O
stand O
and O
dragged O
themselves O
to O
the O
half O
- O
finished O
barracks O
that O
were O
built O
for O
production O
purposes O
in O
this O
field O
and O
just O
lay O
there O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

That O
meant O
a O
search O
with O
flashlights O
, O
examining O
every O
corner O
, O
and O
again O
and O
again O
we O
found O
some O
collapsed O
bundle O
of O
unfortunate O
humanity O
in O
a O
corner O
that O
usually O
proved O
to O
be O
no O
longer O
alive O
. O

And O
so O
, O
after O
15 O
hours O
of O
standing O
in O
the O
cold O
and O
wet O
with O
more O
or O
less O
empty O
stomachs O
, O
it O
was O
no O
small O
matter O
to O
use O
the O
two O
- O
wheeled O
carts O
that O
were O
available O
to O
get O
the O
dead O
and O
half O
- O
dead O
back O
to O
the O
ghetto O
or O
the O
morgue O
. O

You O
came O
home O
half O
- O
dead O
yourself O
and O
really O
appreciated O
what O
it O
means O
to O
have O
four O
walls O
and O
a O
roof O
over O
your O
head O
, O
even O
if O
it O
was O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Not O
long O
after O
, O
a O
transport O
went O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
, O
where O
all O
those O
arrested O
were O
sent O
, O
and O
also O
Edelstein B-PERS
. O

What O
happened O
to O
them O
there O
is O
today O
known O
to O
the O
whole O
world O

the O
following O
was O
the O
cause O
: O
A O
Jewish O
doctor O
, O
Dr O
. O

Karol B-PERS
Berger I-PERS
, O
was O
summoned O
to O
the O
children O
’s O
dormitory O
in O
order O
to O
vaccinate O
the O
children O
against O
typhus O
. O

While O
he O
was O
vaccinating O
them O
, O
three O
mothers O
of O
the O
vaccinated O
children O
said O
that O
the O
Jewish O
doctor O
was O
bothering O
their O
children O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
, O
a O
fourth O
woman O
, O
hearing O
the O
word O
bother O
, O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
and O
down O
the O
street O
, O
screaming O
that O
Jews O
were O
bothering O
Christian O
children O
. O

Right O
then O
and O
there O
, O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Topolčany B-LOC
tore O
into O
the O
room O
and O
stabbed O
Dr O
. O

Berger B-PERS
with O
a O
knife O
. O

They O
also O
broke O
in O
, O
in O
an O
organized O
way O
, O
into O
the O
apartments O
of O
all O
the O
town O
’s O
Jews O
and O
into O
the O
stores O
where O
Jews O
were O
employed O
because O
none O
of O
their O
stores O
were O
returned O
to O
them O
, O
dragged O
the O
Jewish O
inhabitants O
out O
, O
and O
beat O
them O
with O
metal O
rods O
, O
knife O
butts O
, O
and O
other O
objects O
. O

Soldiers O
and O
policemen O
joined O
the O
crowd O
of O
people O
and O
participated O
in O
the O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
riots O
. O

They O
screamed O
that O
Jews O
were O
bothering O
children O
and O
a O
rumour O
was O
spread O
that O
30 O
children O
had O
died O
. O

In O
one O
case O
, O
a O
Jewish O
citizen O
was O
wounded O
by O
a O
hand O
grenade O
that O
was O
thrown O
under O
his O
knees O
. O

According O
to O
my O
information O
, O
49 O
people O
in O
total O
were O
injured O
, O
who O
were O
then O
taken O
to O
the O
rooms O
of B-ORG
the I-ORG
National I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

In O
certain O
cases O
, O
the O
riots O
were O
accompanied O
by O
the O
looting O
of O
apartments O
. O

The O
soldiers O
and O
policemen O
called O
to O
the O
scene O
didn’t O
fulfil O
their O
duties O
, O
didn’t O
protect O
people O
in O
danger O
, O
but O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
had O
beat O
the O
Jews O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
National B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
room O
, O
instead O
of O
providing O
them O
with O
help O
and O
protection O
. O

This O
pogrom O
lasted O
from O
about O
9 O
o’clock O
to O
2:30 O
in O
the O
afternoon O
and O
hundreds O
of O
inhabitants O
had O
taken O
part O
in O
it O
. O

It O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
police O
didn’t O
intervene O
against O
the O
rioters O
, O
nor O
was O
a O
single O
warning O
shot O
fired O
. O

The O
riots O
finally O
ended O
because O
they O
couldn’t O
find O
any O
Jews O
either O
in O
the O
apartments O
or O
on O
the O
street O
, O
because O
many O
had O
hidden O
, O
and O
others O
were O
safe O
with O
the O
National B-ORG
Security I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
. O

The O
riots O
didn’t O
limit O
themselves O
to O
Velké B-LOC
Topolčany B-LOC
, O
but O
spread O
to O
several O
neighboring O
villages O
around O
Topolčany B-LOC
, O
such O
as O
Žabokreky B-LOC
n. I-LOC
Nitrou I-LOC
, O
Chynorany B-LOC
, O
Krásno B-LOC
n. I-LOC
Nitrou I-LOC
, O
and O
Nedanovce B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
because O
people O
had O
run O
to O
some O
of O
the O
villages O
around O
Topolčany B-LOC
and O
spread O
the O
same O
accusations O
as O
in O
Topolčany B-LOC
. O

A O
large O
crowd O
gathered O
in O
Žabokreky B-LOC
, O
which O
also O
broke O
into O
Jewish O
apartments O
, O
in O
which O
they O
found O
citizens O
Schlesinger B-PERS
and O
Polák B-PERS
, O
who O
had O
fought O
in O
the O
Slovak O
Uprising O
as O
partisans O
, O
and O
who O
they O
beat O
with O
carbines O

Reichsprotektor B-ORG
, O
further O
important O
measures O
against O
the O

The O
attitude O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Prague O
and O
in O
other O
towns O
of O
Bohemia O
and O
Moravia O
was O
judged O
to O
have O
been O
provocative O
immediately O
after O
the O
badge O
with O
the O
yellow O
star O
was O
introduced O
, O
before O
and O
after O
the O
recent O
developments O
in O
the O
local O
situation O

It O
is O
true O
that O
they O
ostentatiously O
displayed O
their O
badge O
and O
walked O
in O
the O
streets O
in O
great O
numbers O

I O

the O

All O

After O

I O
was O
sent O
on O
a O
labor O
transport O
, O
and O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Warsaw B-CAMP

They O
housed O
us O
in O
brick O
buildings O
, O
about O
350 O
of O
us O
per O
building O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
camps O
, O
the O
housing O
here O
was O
better O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
the O
former O
ghetto O

clearing O
away O
the O
rubble O

It O
was O
hard O
work O

the O

Only O
½ O
kg O
of O
bread O

two O

at O

Nighttime O
silence O

at O

Our O
clothes O
were O
horrible O

We O
were O
issued O
summer O
prison O
garb O
, O
which O
we O
wore O
even O
when O
we O
worked O
in O
the O
rain O

One O
day O
, O
a O
lockdown O
was O
initiated O
. O

We O
had O
to O
stand O
for O
the O
roll O
call O
and O
the O
Lagerführer O
let O
those O
who O
didn’t O
feel O
strong O
enough O
to O
survive O
a O
100 O
km O

step O
aside O

These O
people O
were O
then O
shot O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
everyone O
in O
the O
sick O
bay O
was O
shot O
as O
well O
. O

Then O
they O
gave O
us O
some O
bread O
, O
filled O
us O
into O
lines O
of O
5 O
, O
and O
we O
marched O
. O

( O
About O
300 O
people O
stayed O
behind O
in O
Warsaw B-CAMP
to O
clean O
up O
after O
us O
. O

When O
the O
ghetto O
rose O
up O
, O
some O
of O
these O
individuals O
were O
beaten O
to O
death O
, O
and O
some O
managed O
to O
escape O
) O
. O

After O
we O
had O
been O
walking O
for O
about O
120 O
km O
, O
we O
reached O
Kutno B-LOC
. O

We O
walked O
30 O
- O
35 O
km O
a O
day O
. O

It O
was O
July B-DATE
and O
incredibly O
hot O
. O

There O
wasn’t O
enough O
food O
and O
they O
didn’t O
give O
us O
any O
water O
. O

People O
collapsed O
from O
thirst O
, O
and O
when O
we O
arrived O
at O
a O
body O
of O
water O
not O
everybody O
got O
to O
drink O
, O
because O
the O
SS O
wouldn’t O
allow O
it O
. O

Here O
, O
SS O
- O
men O
killed O
2 O
people O
, O
one O
of O
them O
my O
best O
friend O
. O

They O
shot O
him O
, O
and O
, O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
they O
ordered O
him O
to O
be O
tossed O
into O
the O
water O
. O

He O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
water O
by O
two O
kapos O
. O

We O
walked O
on O
. O

We O
suffered O
horribly O
from O
thirst O
, O
and O
we O
didn’t O
know O
what O
to O
do O
. O

Once O
, O
when O
we O
stopped O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
we O
started O
digging O
in O
the O
earth O
with O
our O
spoons O
out O
of O
desperation O
. O

We O
were O
lucky O
. O

We O
struck O
water O
about O
50 O
cm O
below O
the O
surface O
. O

We O
could O
finally O
drink O
. O

Others O
followed O
our O
example O
and O
soon O
the O
camp O
was O
full O
of O
small O
pits O
, O
out O
which O
the O
thirsty O
people O
drank O
. O

They O
didn’t O
give O
us O
any O
food O
, O
but O
we O
didn’t O
even O
think O
about O
that O
, O
because O
our O
thirst O
was O
much O
greater O
. O

In O
Kutno B-LOC
, O
we O
waited O
in O
the O
rain O
on O
an O
open O
field O
for O
two O
days O
for O
a O
train O
. O

When O
the O
train O
finally O
arrived O
, O
they O
loaded O
all O
90 O
of O
us O
into O
a O
single O
closed O
cattle O
car O
and O
made O
us O
sit O
along O
the O
two O
sides O
of O
the O
car O
. O

The O
middle O
was O
reserved O
for O
2 O
guards O
and O
two O
kapos O
. O

Everyone O
had O
to O
sit O
down O
. O

Whoever O
didn’t O
sit O
was O
shot O
. O

It O
was O
unbearably O
hot O
. O

Our O
clothes O
, O
laundry O
, O
and O
blankets O
had O
dried O
up O
completely O
in O
the O
car O
and O
we O
were O
gasping O
for O
air O
. O

People O
who O
became O
sick O
were O
shot O
and O
their O
bodies O
were O
thrown O
from O
the O
train O
. O

We O
rode O
for O
5 O
days O
and O
finally O
arrived O
in O
Dachau B-CAMP
. O

They O
left O
us O
here O
for O
about O
a O
week O
and O
then O
took O
us O
to O
Mühldorf B-CAMP
, O
Waldlager B-CAMP
V. O
We O
were O
housed O
in O
paper O
tents O
, O
30 O
per O
tent O
and O
we O
were O
packed O
in O
so O
tightly O
that O
we O
couldn’t O
sleep O
at O
night O
. O

There O
was O
one O
blanket O
for O
every O
two O
2 O
people O
. O

We O
had O
no O
water O
to O
drink O
or O
to O
wash O
ourselves O
with O
, O
they O
only O
brought O
us O
water O
for O
cooking O
. O

We O
were O
building O
an O
airplane O
factory O
. O

For O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
with O
no O
breaks O
, O
we O
carried O
cement O
and O
never O
even O
went O
back O
to O
the O
camp O
for O
lunch O
. O

There O
was O
a O
day O
and O
night O
shift O
, O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
every O
week O
we O
switched O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O

We O
didn’t O
get O
any O
clean O
clothes O
, O
there O
was O
no O
water O
for O
washing O
, O
and O
so O
it O
was O
not O
surprising O
when O
we O
all O
got O
lice O
, O
which O
only O
multiplied O
until O
we O
were O
covered O
in O
millions O
of O
them O
. O

There O
wasn’t O
enough O
food O
and O
, O
over O
time O
, O
there O
was O
even O
less O
and O
less O
of O
it O
. O

In O
the O
final O
days O
, O
we O
only O
got O
a O
little O
soup O
— O
dirty O
water O
with O
potato O
scraps O
floating O
in O
it O
. O

So O
many O
people O
died O
, O
every O
day O
20 O
- O
30 O
of O
us O
perished O
. O

Every O
14 O
days O
more O
transports O
arrived O
from O
the O
main O
concentration O
camp O
. O

There O
were O
cases O
when O
people O
were O
killed O
while O
they O
worked O
, O
when O
they O
were O
too O
weak O
to O
work O
any O
longer O
. O

When O
we O
were O
liberated O
, O
we O
left O
about O
3,000 O
dead O
people O
behind O
. O

After O
the O
liberation O
, O

[ O
… O
] O
In O
discussing O
with O
the O
leaders O
of O
various O
Jewish O
groups O
their O
reactions O
, O
I O
gained O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
is O
mainly O
the O
orthodox O
, O
and O
even O
amongst O
their O
number O
the O
more O
strictly O
religious O
, O
who O
, O
from O
a O
religious O
angle O
are O
seriously O
concerned O
over O
the O
prospect O
of O
eventually O
doing O
away O
with O
ritual O
slaughter O
. O

Others O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Zionists O
, O
and O
the O
Zionist O
Revisionists O
, O
and O
particularly O
the O
youth O
thereof O
, O
are O
less O
concerned O
by O
the O
bill O
’s O
potential O
effect O
on O
ritual O
slaughter O
than O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
bill O
’s O
presaging O
further O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
measures O
. O

One O
prominent O
member O
of O
the O
Zionist O
Revisionist O
inner O
circles O
imparted O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
bill O
was O
aimed O
mainly O
as O
propaganda O
to O
force O
the O
Jews O
of O
all O
categories O
in O
Poland B-LOC
to O
unite O
in O
support O
of O
the O
Government O
search O
for O
a O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
, O
mainly O
in O
terms O
of O
emigration O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
My O
own O
observation O
led O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
contributing O
to O
the O
bill O
’s O
proposal O
there O
are O
the O
following O
military O
and O
social O
aspects O
: O
military O
, O
in O
that O
the O
Army O
’s O
long O
- O
range O
program O
envisages O
the O
eventual O
centralization O
of O
meat O
control O
and O
refrigeration O
to O
meet O
emergency O
periods O
; O
and O
socially O
, O
in O
that O
the O
racial O
Polish B-LOC
peasant O
wants O
to O
replace O
the O
Jew O
in O
the O
meat O
business O
. O

As O
to O
the O
prospects O
of O
the O
bill O
’s O
amendment O
, O
this O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
will O
depend O
largely O
upon O
the O
Government O
’s O
attitude O
in O
general O
towards O
the O
Jewish O
question O
. O

A O
revivication O
of O
the O
Iron O

did O
not O

, O
the O

the O

, O
both O
actual O
and O

, O
is O
greatly O
diminished O
. O

But O
the O
Nazi O
shadow O
still O
looms O
large O
. O

Whether O
the O
German O
threat O
is O
a O
controlling O
or O
only O
a O
contributory O
factor O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
plight O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
this O
country O
has O
grown O
worse O
and O
their O
fears O
are O
greatly O
increased O
. O

The O
Government O
can O
scarcely O
be O
called O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
Goga B-PERS
Government O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
strongly O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
, O
but O
it O
‘ O
recognizes O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
Jewish O
problem O
’ O
and O
many O
are O
constrained O
to O
feel O
that O
although O
the O
Goga B-PERS
and O
Cuza B-PERS
program O
was O
openly O
and O
violently O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
the O
actual O
effect O
of O
the O
measures O
and O
methods O
employed O
by O
the O
present O
regime O
is O
more O
severe O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
out O
- O
and O
- O
out O
pogrom O
and O
that O
Governmental O
regulation O
of O
the O
Jews O
is O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
relatively O
slight O
, O
but O
pressure O
, O
obstacles O
, O
discriminations O
– O
all O
of O
these O
forms O
of O
persecution O
are O
becoming O
noticeably O
more O
numerous O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
attitude O
of O
the O
Romanian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
, O
then O
, O
that O
this O
surplus O
population O
of O
non O
- O
citizen O
Jews O
must O
go O
; O
there O
is O
to O
be O
no O
pogrom O
, O
no O
violence O
, O
no O
brutality O
, O
but O
they O
must O
go O
. O

Until O
a O
place O
is O
found O
for O
them O
and O
an O
arrangement O
is O
made O
for O
them O
to O
get O
there O
they O
will O
probably O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

As O
to O
the O
others O
, O
the O
800,000 O
who O
have O
established O
their O
citizenship O
, O
the O
Government O
points O
to O
their O
citizenship O
as O
a O
guarantee O
of O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
accorded O
to O
others O
, O
although O
admitting O
that O
Jews O
‘ O
will O
probably O
not O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
higher O
positions O
’ O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Romanians O
are O
not O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
a O
harsh O
or O
vindictive O
people O
; O
they O
are O
, O
rather O
, O
tolerant O
and O
easy O
- O
going O
. O

I O
feel O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
although O
the O
program O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
what O
are O
termed O
the O
‘ O
surplus O
’ O
Jews O
will O
probably O
in O
any O
case O
be O
retained O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
likelihood O
of O
such O
a O
degree O
of O
violence O
or O

being O
employed O

The O

placed O
the O

the O

They O
tried O

searched O
their O

In O
the O

they O
found O

Almost O
all O
of O
the O
dead O

were O
poorly O

had O
unsuitable O

no O

An O
interesting O
finding O
was O
that O
some O

had O
only O

one O
had O
a O

They O
must O
have O
come O

, O
the O
children O
were O
mostly O
dependent O

the O
help O

all O
day O
long O
. O

The O
Jewish O
school O
was O
banned O
along O
with O
all O
private O
lessons O
on O
July B-DATE
24 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1942 I-DATE
. O

The O
activities O
suggested O
by O
the O
youth O
department O
were O
as O
follows O
: O
games O
, O
handicrafts O
, O
work O
education O
and O
general O
education O
. O

The O
responsible O
Gestapo B-ORG
officer O
remarked O
: O
If O
they’re O
being O
taught O
, O
heads O
will O
roll O
; O
just O
leave O
them O
nice O
and O
dumb O
. O

The O
management O
of O
the O
JKG O
feels O
obliged O
to O
communicate O
this O
comment O
verbatim O
to O
the O
youth O
department O
, O
with O
the O
appropriate O
warning O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
youth O
department O
was O
not O
able O
( O
or O
willing O
) O
to O
prevent O
the O
lessons O
, O
because O
the O
instructors O
were O
adept O
at O
circumventing O
the O
order O
. O

For O
example O
, O
geography O
was O
hidden O
behind O
the O
game O
Town O
Councils O
, O
history O
behind O
the O
game O
Famous O
People O
. O

Arithmetic O
games O
replaced O
mathematics O
, O
general O
studies O
replaced O
physics O
, O
chemistry O
, O
etc O
. O

Reading O
aloud O
was O
allowed O
: O
we O
let O
the O
children O
read O
themselves O
and O
thus O
circumvented O
another O
ban O
. O

In O
the O
handicraft O
lesson O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
was O
on O
drawing O
, O
but O
also O
on O
natural O
history O
, O
in O
that O
flowers O
and O
animals O
were O
drawn O
. O

You O
had O
to O
be O
extremely O
careful O
, O
because O
there O
were O
spies O
among O
the O
children O
’s O
parents O
who O
gave O
the O
children O
orders O
themselves O
. O

A O
noticeable O
obstacle O
to O
the O
possibility O
of O
consolidation O
, O
which O
was O
certainly O
a O
given O
, O
was O
of O
course O
repeated O
transports O
, O
which O
tore O
up O
newly O
formed O
friendships O
and O
repeatedly O
changed O
the O
image O
of O
the O
home O
in O
question O
. O

During O
transport O
days O
the O
home O
was O
closed O
to O
the O
youth O
welfare O
service O
. O

It O
happened O
in O
some O
specific O
cases O
that O
smaller O
children O
without O
prior O
instruction O
answered O
questions O
skilfully O
and O
well O
at O
controls O
by O
the O
German O
authorities O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
7-year O
- O
old O
girl O
, O
who O
knew O
the O
whole O
1x1 O
by O
heart O
and O
was O
extremely O
talented O
, O
answered O
the O
question O
how O
much O
3 O
- O
10 O
is O
: O
What O
does O
the O
Lord O
actually O
want O
? O
Or O
to O
the O
question O
, O
what O
are O
you O
doing O
there O
, O
the O
children O
answered O
playing O
. O

It O
must O
be O
emphasized O
again O
that O
we O
did O
not O
instruct O
the O
children O
at O
all O
, O
if O
only O
for O
fear O
that O
they O
would O
reveal O
it O
if O
it O
came O
down O
to O
it O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
we O
let O
them O
believe O
that O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
was O
absolutely O
authorized O
and O
legal O
. O

When O
asked O
if O
the O
home O
was O
boring O
or O
interesting O
, O
the O
biggest O
crook O
in O
the O
class O
replied O
: O
It O

not O
boring O
here O
at O
all O

I'm O
glad O
I O
don’t O

of O
a O

that O

arisen O
during O

the O
operations O

out O
by O
Germany B-LOC

A O
large O

in O

These O

the O

, O
in O

So O

according O

the O
number O

amounts O

12,000 O

this O

increase O

as O
a O

to O
those O

question O
in O
Germany B-LOC

During O
the O
period O
from O
spring O
1940 O
to O
Spring O
1943 O
, O
the O
Jews O
in O
Germany O
were O
deported O
. O

The O
deportation O
began O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
in O
February B-DATE
1940 I-DATE
and O
is O
now O
largely O
completed O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
elderly O
( O
originally O
over O
65 O
, O
now O
over O
70 O
years O
) O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
in O
the O
Bohemia O
- O
Moravian O
Protectorate O
, O
whose O
former O
population O
had O
been O
evacuated O
. O

The O
city O
, O
which O
originally O
had O
20 O
to O
25,000 O
inhabitants O
, O
now O
contains O
approx O
. O

50,000 O
Jews O
. O

However O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
population O
consists O
only O
of O
the O
Old O
people O
, O
the O
passing O
is O
still O
very O
large O
. O

Young O
Jews O
have O
been O
deployed O
to O
work O
in O
various O
locations O
in O
the O
eastern O
areas O
. O

The O
deportation O
has O
been O
practiced O
somewhat O
differently O
in O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
exceptions O
that O
apply O
to O
certain O
areas O
of O
the O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
under O
the O
legislation O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Jews O
married O
to O
Aryans O
, O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
observed O
during O
the O
Deportations O
. O

The O
Jewish O
spouse O
in O
such O
a O
marriage O
is O
usually O
spared O
only O
when O
he O
or O
she O
lives O
with O
the O
Aryan O
partner O
or O
with O
any O
common O
Children O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
children O
are O
minors O
or O
adults O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
several O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
men O
married O
to O
Aryan O
women O
have O
been O
deported O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
no O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
women O
married O
to O
Aryan O
men O
were O
deported O
. O

There O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish O
spouse O
has O
been O
deported O
after O
the O
couple O
's O
only O
son O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
, O
which O
otherwise O
in O
Jewish O
laws O
justifies O
a O
privileged O
position O
. O

This O
is O
motivated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exception O
from O
deportation O
can O
only O
be O
justified O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
the O
spouse O
or O
children O
, O
and O
that O
this O
consideration O
no O
longer O
applies O
when O
the O
child O
does O
not O
live O
at O
home O
, O
cf O
. O

above O
, O
or O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
. O

Although O
Jewish O
law O
in O
principle O
applies O
only O
to O
Jews O
, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
special O
provisions O
in O
the O
Practice O
of O
Mischlinge O
( O
Half O
and O
Quarter O
Jews O
) O
that O
they O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
special O
class O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
all O
areas O
where O
the O
Administration O
’s O
decisions O
are O
decisive O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
attitude O
must O
be O
considered O
. O

Within O
leading O
circles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
movements O
, O
one O
that O
wants O
to O
restrict O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
to O
the O
real O
Jews O
, O
and O
one O
more O
radical O
that O
wants O
to O
liberate O
Germany O
from O
both O
Jews O
and O
Bastards O
. O

Which O
movement O
ultimately O
prevails O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
, O
but O
the O
radical O
direction O
in O
recent O
times O
seems O
to O
assert O
itself O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
provision O
introduced O
in O
1942 O
, O
whereby O
half O
Jews O
are O
excluded O
from O
the O
army O
, O
could O
be O
fatal O
. O

One O
has O
to O
consider O
, O
that O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
citizenship O
links O
to O
the O
right O
to O
exercise O
civil O
rights O
such O
as O
military O
service O
and O
labor O
service O
. O

Therefore O
Mischlinge O
, O
who O
fail O
to O
serve O
, O
are O
prevented O
from O
enjoying O
civil O
rights O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
in O
the O
Legislature O
of O
Quarter O
Jews O
marrying O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
the O
Standesämter O
refuse O
to O
marry O
such O
persons O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
special O
permit O
. O

The O
limited O
access O
of O
the O
Mischlinge O
to O
- O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Half O
Jews O
, O
total O
exclusion O
from O
- O
the O
higher O
education O
( O
including O
vocational O
schools O
) O
may O
in O
the O
future O
have O
the O
most O
fateful O
consequences O
, O
with O
Half O
Jews O
subsequently O
missing O
the O
prerequisite O
for O
becoming O
anything O
but O
unskilled O
workers O
. O

Mischlinge O
are O
excluded O
from O
owning O
an O
inheritance O
farm O
, O
requiring O
Aryan O
descent O
since O
1800 O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
other O
land O
estates O
, O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
, O
but O
in O
practice O
, O
Mischlinge O
will O
generally O
be O
forced O
out O
of O
possession O
of O
such O
property O
, O
the O
same O
applies O
to O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
of O
Jews O
. O

Mischlinge O
and O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
have O
free O
access O
to O
private O
businesses O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
in O
Practice O
they O
will O
often O
be O
pushed O
out O
of O
Companies O
of O
any O
significance O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
armour O
industry O
– O
companies O
owned O
them O
or O
within O
which O
they O
play O
a O
large O
role O
will O
be O
excluded O
from O
public O
order O
. O

There O
are O
still O
rumours O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
of O
further O
measures O
taken O
against O
the O
Jews O
, O
e.g O
. O

, O
it O
states O
that O
a O
law O
must O
be O
drawn O
up O
, O
requiring O
Aryans O
who O
are O
married O
to O
Jews O
to O
divorce O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Jewish O
law O
in O
its O
full O
extent O
could O
be O
put O
into O
effect O
also O
for O
the O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
have O
hitherto O
been O
allowed O
to O
stay O
because O
they O
were O
married O
to O
Aryans O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
rumours O
have O
been O
spread O
regarding O
certain O
measures O
against O
half O
Jews O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
Mischlinge O
in O
cities O
, O
where O
the O
housing O
demand O
is O
high O
due O
to O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
airstrikes O
, O
should O
be O
evicted O
from O
their O
apartments O
. O

Whether O
this O
will O
happen O
is O
impossible O
to O
predict O
. O

However O
, O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
it O
has O
been O
noted O
that O
the O
Campaign O
against O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
Press O
has O
now O
been O
intensified O
again O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
lately O
, O
Mischlinge O
has O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
Bastards O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Mischling O
problem O
is O
to O
a O
significant O
degree O
an O
upper O
- O
class O
problem O
; O
since O
the O
mixed O
marriages O
have O
mainly O
taken O
place O
within O
the O
bourgeoisie O
, O
there O
could O
also O
be O
an O
unfortunate O
impact O
on O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Mischlinge O
. O

this O

negative O
consequences O

which O
were O
not O
caused O
by O
Edelstein B-PERS

but O
by O
the O
overall O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

He O
was O
relentless O
in O
his O
work O

accepted O
anyone O

request O

the O

During O
the O
departure O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
with O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Staff O
for O
short O
goodbyes O
, O
during O
which O
the O
deceased O
Dr O
. O

Weidmann B-PERS
described O
the O
character O
of O
Edelstein B-PERS
as O
well O
as O
Ing O
. O

Zucker B-PERS
and O
noted O
that O
even O
though O
they O
are O
confirmed O
zionists O
, O
there O
are O
differences O
between O
them O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
Edelstein B-PERS
is O
more O
emotional O
, O
while O
Zucker B-PERS
is O
harsher O
, O
but O
these O
two O
types O
are O
necessary O
for O
the O
building O
of O
the O
ghetto O
and O
it O
will O
be O
to O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
, O
because O
they O
are O
two O
different O
personalities O
, O
but O
understand O
one O
another O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
main O
issues O
. O

Ing O
. O

Zucker B-PERS
is O
perhaps O
harsher O
than O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
but O
even O
he O
worked O
tirelessly O
and O
selflessly O
on O
the O
building O
and O
improvement O
of O
the O
ghetto O
. O

He O
devoted O
himself O
not O
only O
to O
the O
work O
that O
was O
determined O
for O
him O
, O
but O
also O
to O
art O
, O
music O
, O
etc O
. O

He O
kept O
company O
with O
artists O
and O
scholars O
, O
for O
whom O
he O
found O
time O
for O
in O
his O
scant O
free O
moments O
. O

He O
too O
, O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
Dr O
. O

Epstein B-PERS
and O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
began O
to O
argue O
and O
feel O
disgusted O
, O
which O
he O
took O
badly O
, O
just O
like O
Edelstein B-PERS

In O
short O
, O
Ing O

Zucker B-PERS
was O
just O
like O
Edelstein B-PERS

an O
more O

Erich B-PERS
Munk I-PERS
I O
would O
describe O

Munk B-PERS
as O
he O
was O
characterized O
during O
an O
SS O

member O
meeting O
in O
the O
Kameradschaftsheimu O

where O
all O
of O
the O

their O
character O

behavior O
and O
where O
Munk B-PERS
was O
called O
by O
Seidl B-PERS

Günther B-PERS
, O
who O
were O
sticklers O
for O
the O
rules O

a O
direct O

It O
was O
his O

during O
his O
first O
days O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
as O
the O
head O
of O
health B-ORG

, O
can O
only O
be O
judged O
by O
someone O
who O
worked O
with O
him O
. O

Out O
of O
nothing O
he O
created O
a O
health B-ORG
care I-ORG
system O
at O
such O
a O
high O
level O
that O
he O
saved O
thousands O
from O
their O
deaths O
. O

He O
worked O
only O
in O
the O
public O
’s O
interest O
, O
and O
never O
for O
personal O
gain O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
his O
term O
he O
contracted O
tuberculosis O
, O
and O
had O
to O
be O
treated O
for O
it O
for O
several O
months O
. O

He O
worked O
using O
all O
of O
the O
resources O
at O
his O
disposal O
and O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
sufficient O
quantity O
of O
medicine O
when O
he O
relentlessly O
notified O
the O
Germans B-LOC
of O
the O

the O

they O

they O

Through O

it O
was O
announced O
that O
, O
in O
mid O
- O
January O
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
, O
had O
been O
on O
a O
1-day O
visit O
with O
Chancellor O
Hitler B-PERS
. O

In O
Bucharest B-LOC
was O
the O
meeting O
not O
officially O
mentioned O
, O
and O
therefore O
gave O
rise O
to O
some O
remarkable O
rumours O
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
General O
’s O
return O
, O
a O
German B-ORG
General I-ORG
Staff I-ORG
Officer I-ORG
, O
Major B-PERS
Döring I-PERS
, O
was O
murdered O
on O
the O
street O
in O
Bucharest O
. O

The O
killer O
is O
said O
to O
be O
a O
man O
with O
a O
Greek B-LOC
name O
, O
Dimitrie B-PERS
Sarandos I-PERS
, O
who O
had O
come O
from O
America B-LOC
with O
a O
Turkish B-LOC
passport O
and O
whose O
profession O
is O
stated O
as O
being O
a O
wrestler O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
the O
murder O
has O
so O
far O
not O
been O
resolved O
; O
officials O
say O
that O
they O
are O
still O
investigating O
the O
crime O
. O

However O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
’s I-PERS
dismissal O
of O
the O
legionary B-ORG
Minister B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
General B-PERS
Petrovicescu I-PERS
, O
who O
was O
accused O
of O
not O
taking O
immediate O
action O
for O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
. O

The O
Legionary O
Press O
protested O
against O
this O
dismissal O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
emphasizing O
its O
strong O
association O
with O
the O
Axis O
Powers O
, O
calling O
for O
revenge O
on O
those O
who O
stood O
behind O
the O
killer O
. O

It O
can O
thus O
be O
concluded O
, O
that O
the O
murder O
was O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Axis O
in O
Romania B-LOC
, O
as O
Romanian O
Patriots O
suggested O
it O
in O
a O
British B-LOC
Radio O
broadcasts O
, O
since O
the O
warring O
parties O
agree O
that O
only O
the O
Axis O
military O
precautions O
in O
Romania O
save O
them O
from O
further O
segregation O
between O
their O
hostile O
neighbours O
. O

One O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
Press O
controlled O
by O
the O
Legionnaires O
made O
propaganda O
for O
the O
Revolution O
, O
i.e O
. O

further O
looting O
of O
the O
possessive O
classes O
and O
especially O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Freemasons O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
that O
he O
ruled O
with O
some O
Ministers O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
i.e O
. O

on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
evolutionary O
development O
, O
while O
the O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
Legionary B-ORG
Commander O
Horia B-PERS
Sima I-PERS
with O
other O
Ministers O
, O
ruled O
towards O
a O
Revolution O
and O
immediate O
looting O
and O
destruction O
of O
everything O
of O
endurance O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
unsustainable O
and O
as O
a O
first O
serious O
countermeasure O
from O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
’s O
site O
emerged O
on O
21 O
of O
this O
month O
a O
decree O
abolishing O
the O
main O
efforts O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
to O
militarize O
the O
Romanian O
institutions O
as O
well O
as O
important O
State O
enterprises O
. O

I O
have O
reported O
this O
in O
my O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

The O
answer O
to O
this O
relatively O
peaceful O
act O
was O
that O
the O
Legionary O
Party O
on O
the O
22 O
of O
this O
month O
occupied O
a O
police O
barrack O
with O
600 O
men O
, O
located O
right O
next O
to O
the O
Foreign B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
, O
where O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
has O
his O
Bureau O
as O
well O
as O
his O
temporary O
residence O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
rebellion O
had O
begun O
. O

It O
soon O
became O
clear O
that O
the O
Legionnaires O
were O
well O
supplied O
with O
rifles O
and O
ammunition O
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
prepared O
the O
action O

The O

commanded O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS

finally O
succeeded O
in O
capturing O
the O
Police O

from O
which O
the O
Legionnaires O
attacked O
the O
Foreign O
Ministry O
with O
the O
purpose O
of O
killing O
the O
General O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
, O
the O
military O
sought O
to O
avoid O
shooting O
and O
trusted O
the O
effect O
of O
their O
sole O
appearance O

However O
, O
as O
Soldier O
everywhere O
where O
shot O
down O
, O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
second O
day O
, O
a O
common O
battle O
erupted O
throughout O
the O
city O

during O
which O
the O
military O
, O
with O
guns O
, O
tanks O
and O
machine O
guns O
, O
damaged O
the O
fortified O
houses O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

There O
were O
many O
dead O
and O
wounded O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
know O
how O
many O
. O

However O
, O
the O
number O
of O
victims O
is O
hardly O
proportional O
to O
the O
periodic O
violent O
cannonade O
that O
lasted O
all O
day O
and O
night O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
days O
. O

All O
this O
time O
, O
Legionnaire O
gangs O
carried O
out O
gruesome O
pogroms O
, O
notably O
against O
the O
Jewish O
Proletariat O
in O
the O

where O
large O

an O
order O
to O
the O

to O
put O
down O
the O

The O

only O
partially O
complied O
with O
the O
order O

in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
afternoon O
, O
at O

, O
they O
succeeded O

By O
Friday O
morning O
, O
the O
uprising O
was O
dissolved O
and O
the O
entire O
city O
occupied O
by O
the O
Romanian O
Military O

which O
began O
searching O

the O

large O
quantities O
of O
stolen O
goods O
distributed O
over O
many O
houses O
have O
since O
been O
brought O
to O
light O
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
the O
entire O
Rebellion O
has O
been O
planned O
and O
staged O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
’s I-PERS
closest O
Employees O
in O
the O

The O

were O
searching O
for O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
Horia B-PERS

and O
it O
is O
said O
that O
he O
has O
been O
arrested O
today O
. O

The O
appointment O
of O
a O
general O
government O
was O
generally O
expected O
, O
but O
so O
far O
, O
nothing O
has O
been O
published O
regarding O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
government O
, O
let O
alone O
its O
dismissal O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
the O
country O
is O
currently O
administered O
solely O
the O
Governor O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
, O
currently O
administers O
the O
country O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
declared O
state O
of O
emergency O
. O

Intelligence O
from O
the O
Province O
suggests O
that O
rebellions O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
as O
here O
have O
been O
common O
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
while O
the O
rural O
population O
itself O
has O
turned O
against O
the O
plans O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

After O
the O
rebellion O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
issued O
a O
comprehensive O
Proclamation O
to O
the O
People O
. O

The O
general B-PERS
thanked O
the O
Army O
for O
its O
courage O
, O
describing O
the O
suffering O
he O
went O
through O
before O
it O
became O
inevitable O
to O
shoot O
at O
the O
people O
, O
he O
declares O
that O
from O
now O
on O
he O
will O
personally O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
youth O
’s O
education O
and O
that O
all O
who O
are O
guilty O
will O
be O
punished O
. O

General O
Disarmament O
will O
now O
be O
implemented O
by O
the O
Military O
. O

The O
Romanians O
here O
have O
stated O
to O
me O
that O
the O
proclamation O
is O
well O
suited O
to O
make O
an O
impression O
, O
especially O
within O
the O
large O
Romanian O
peasant O
population O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
is O
found O
to O
be O
too O
lyrical O
and O
weak O
to O
deter O
future O
troublemakers O
. O

Especially O
regarding O
the O
last O
point O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
the O
general B-PERS
now O
faces O
a O
number O
of O
challenges O
in O
setting O
up O
a O
new O
Ministry O
, O
but O
the O
situation O
is O
still O
too O
unclear O
to O
be O
overlooked O
. O

The O
precautions O
taken O
against O
the O
Jews O
in O
Norway B-LOC
, O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
were O
directed O
mainly O
towards O
Full O
Jews O
. O

Full O
Jews O
are O
understood O
as O
persons O
whose O
parents O
were O
both O
of O
Jewish O
descent O
and O
persons O
belonging O
to O
the O
Mosaic O
Faith O
Society O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
all O
such O
persons O
were O
also O
subject O
to O
the O
precautions O
taken O
and O
it O
did O
not O
play O
any O
role O
, O
whether O
he O
was O
married O
to O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
or O
in O
a O
marriage O
to O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
with O
children O
. O

Exceptions O
to O
this O
rule O
were O
probably O
, O
both O
so O
that O
some O
Half O
- O
Jews O
may O
have O
been O
deported O
, O
and O
so O
that O
Full O
- O
Jews O
who O
have O
been O
married O
to O
non O
- O
Jews O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
country O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
three O
Concentration O
Camps O
in O
Norway O
, O
there O
are O
various O
Jews O
, O
all O
of O
whom O

the O

Interned O
half O
- O
Jews O
are O
found O
in O
Grini B-CAMP
, O
but O
these O
are O
not O
interned O
because O
of O
their O
descent O
, O
but O
because O
charges O
of O
some O
kind O
have O
been O
raised O
against O
them O
. O

Jews O
who O
are O
Norwegian O
citizens O
have O
been O
interned O
on O
the O
request O
of O
the O
Germans O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
the O
Germans O
have O
agreed O
that O
no O
more O
deportation O
will O
take O
place O
from O
Norway B-LOC
of O
Jews O
who O
are O
Norwegian B-LOC
citizens O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
German O
authorities O
have O
agreed O
to O
disregard O
wealth O
confiscation O
in O
cases O
where O
a O
Jewish O
man O
is O
detained O
in O
a O
concentration O
camp O
or O
deported O
, O
and O
a O
non- O
Jewish O

Jews O

30 O

In O

a O

separated O
from O
it O
only O
by O
a O
high O

when O

requested O
that O
a O

should O
be O
sent O
out O
to O
work O
in O

the O
Jews O
refused O

saying O
that O
they O

not O

again O
from O
the O

that O

previously O
left O
the O

As O
we O

a O

that O
is O

On O
the O
one O
side O
the O
Jews O

of O
whom O
there O
are O
still O
perhaps O
about O
15,000 O

who O
have O
dug O
themselves O
in O
inside O
the O

building O
underground O
bunkers O
up O
to O
thirty O
meters O
deep O
, O
powerfully O
armoured O

huge O
stockpiles O
of O

that O
could O
last O
them O

the O

During O

[ O

These O

suggest O
that O
a O
solution O
might O
be O
found O
by O
transforming O
the O
struggle O

which O
right O
now O
has O
taken O
on O
the O
character O

thus O
endowing O

it O

its O
true O
essence O

the O
struggle O
of O
Europe O

led O

For O
this O
struggle O
one O
could O
rely O

the O
organization O

would O
fight O

To O
this O
Russia B-LOC

the O

is O
not O
precisely O
known O
if O
part O
of O
the O
sums O
thus O
obtained O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
sustenance O
of O
destitute O
Jews O
, O
who O
are O
the O
great O
majority O
. O

Several O
sources O
confirm O
that O
their O
transfer O
to O
Poland B-LOC
should O
start O
anytime O
now O
. O

German O
authorities O
have O
requested O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
a O
list O
of O
120 O
prominent O
persons O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
hostages O
. O

In O
this O
list O
there O
are O
also O
12 O
Italian O
citizens O
of O
Jewish O
race O
who O
, O
together O
with O
the O
others O
, O
were O
summoned O
on O
the O
7th O
inst O
. O

to O
the O
Community`s O
premises O
where O
a O
German O
officer O
gave O
a O
short O
speech O
and O
explained O
that O
they O
would O
answer O
with O
their O
own O
persons O
for O
any O
accident O
or O
act O
of O
sabotage O
that O
might O
occur O
. O

He O
added O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
his O
duty O
to O
intern O
them O
at O
once O
in O
a O
concentration O
camp O
, O
but O
that O
due O
to O
the O
assurances O
given O
by O
the O
Chief O
Rabbi O
he O
would O
let O
them O
stay O
free O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

The O
said O
prominent O
persons O
are O
also O
required O
to O
provide O
out O
of O
their O
own O
means O
for O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
poorer O
Jews O
. O

I O
have O
approached O
the O
Befehlshaber O
and O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
his O
assurance O
that O
the O
Italian O
citizens O
will O
be O
removed O
from O
said O
list O
and O
we O
reached O
an O
understanding O
that O
they O
will O
no O
longer O
comply O
with O
the O
instructions O
and O
the O
orders O
they O
should O
still O
receive O
through O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
zeal O
displayed O
by O
the O
offices O
in O
charge O
of O
carrying O
out O
the O
adopted O
measures O
, O
I O
find O
myself O
compelled O
all O
the O
time O
to O
undertake O
steps O
to O
prevent O
our O
fellow O
- O
citizens O
from O
being O
hampered O
in O
their O
usual O
commercial O
activity O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only O
inevitable O
repercussions O
of O
a O
very O
limited O
and O
modest O
relevance O
. O

The O
sudden O
removal O
from O
town O
life O
of O
over O
50 O
thousand O
people O
, O
who O
for O
centuries O
had O
continuously O
been O
engaged O
in O
important O
activities O
, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
serious O
inconveniences O
. O

A O
great O
many O
services O
that O
were O
provided O
almost O
exclusively O
by O
Jews O
are O
now O
missing O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
commodities O
has O
increased O
sharply O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
the O
local O
press O
has O
been O
clamouring O
for O
severe O
steps O
against O
the O
Greek B-LOC
merchants O
who O
exploit O
the O
present O
moment O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
closing O
of O
the O
great O
many O
Jewish O
shops O
, O
to O
the O
diminished O
traffic O
in O
the O
streets O
and O
to O
the O
scarcity O
of O
public O
in O
cinemas O
and O
in O
restaurants O
- O
cafés O
, O
the O
town O
has O
acquired O
a O
look O
pervaded O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
sadness O
. O

The O
Greek B-LOC
element O
, O
except O
for O
the O
merchants O
who O
have O
seen O
their O
dreaded O
competitors O
disappear O
, O
displays O
no O
enthusiasm O
for O
all O
that O
is O
being O
done O
, O
quite O
the O
opposite O
, O
they O
worry O
about O
the O
immediate O
and O
future O
consequences O
. O

The O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
issued O
by O
us O
with O
a O
pass O
have O
been O
prevented O
by O
German O
authorities O
from O
reaching O
our O
zone O
. O

I O
have O
enquired O
to O
see O
if O
some O
exception O
might O
not O
be O
granted O
for O
the O
most O
serious O
cases O
, O
but O
have O
received O
a O
negative O
answer O
, O
in O
fact O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
would O
request O
that O
those O
who O
had O
already O
moved O
into O
our O
territory O
be O
returned O
to O
them O

A O
Small O
Incident O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
Ghetto O
On O
April O
10th O
of O
this O
year O
, O
I O
was O
leaving O
the O
ceramics O
workshop O
in O
the O
Bauhof O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
late O
at O
12:30 O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
courtyard O
was O
deserted O
. O

Then O
, O
I O
suddenly O
saw O
Rahm B-PERS
, O
Heindl B-PERS
Haindl O
, O
and O
another O
German B-LOC
in O
uniform O
, O
probably O
Buchholz B-PERS
, O
approaching O
from O
a O
distance O
. O

I O
walked O
past O
them O
with O
a O
very O
uneasy O
feeling O
. O

Heindl B-PERS
Haindl O
then O
turned O
to O
me O
and O
said O
: O
Halo O
, O
kommens O
mal O
mit O
. O

I O
was O
very O
surprised O
that O
they O
wanted O
me O
to O
come O
with O
them O
. O

They O
were O
going O
to O
a O
section O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
where O
only O
Germans B-LOC
lived O
. O

By O
the O
gate O
to O
this O
section O
they O
called O
out O
to O
the O
dog O
breeder O
, O
Busch B-PERS
. O

When O
he O
appeared O
, O
they O
ordered O
him O
to O
sic O
a O
german O
shepherd O
on O
me O
. O

Mr O
. O

Busch B-PERS
’ O
s O
wife O
was O
secretly O
watching O
from O
behind O
the O
door O
and O
I O
, O
seeing O
her O
scared O
face O
, O
thought O
that O
the O
best O
case O
scenario O
would O
be O
that O
I O
would O
momentarily O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

Busch B-PERS
, O
who O
put O
a O
training O
jacket O
on O
me O
, O
told O
me O
to O
always O
extend O
my O
arm O
out O
towards O
the O
dog O
and O
that O
he O
would O
bite O
it O
. O

The O
jacket O
weighed O
at O
least O
15 O
kg O
. O

With O
it O
on O
, O
I O
had O
to O
run O
in O
all O
directions O
, O
over O
various O
obstacles O
, O
and O
they O
would O
sic O
the O
dog O
on O
me O
. O

I O
always O
managed O
to O
get O
the O
dog O
to O
bite O
the O
sleeve O
of O
my O
jacket O
, O
but O
I O
was O
starting O
to O
get O
tired O
. O

Thoroughly O
worn O
out O
, O
I O
told O
them O
I O
could O
no O
longer O
run O
. O

Rahm B-PERS
, O
standing O
on O
higher O
ground O
, O
shouted O
: O
lauf O
. O

I O
had O
to O
run O
again O
. O

I O
was O
angry O
, O
not O
out O
of O
fear O
, O
but O
about O
the O
powerless O
situation O
I O
was O
in O
. O

They O
called O
the O
dog O
over O
and O
conferred O
with O
Mr O
. O

Busch B-PERS
. O

Busch B-PERS
came O
to O
me O
and O
told O
me O
to O
take O
off O
the O
jacket O
. O

My O
only O
reply O
was O
what O
do O
they O
want O
to O
do O
to O
me O
and O
surrendered O
myself O
to O
my O
fate O
. O

It O
went O
through O
my O
mind O
that O
if O
the O
dog O
got O
my O
arm O
, O
I’d O
be O
finished O
as O
a O
sculptor O
and O
painter O
. O

I O
was O
ordered O
to O
climb O
up O
on O
a O
wooden O
gate O
, O
about O
2 O
m O
high O
. O

As O
I O
was O
climbing O
up O
, O
the O
rabid O
dog O
was O
nipping O
at O
my O
heels O
. O

I O
balanced O
on O
top O
as O
well O
as O
I O
could O
and O
tried O
to O
not O
fall O
or O
else O
the O
dog O
could O
bite O
my O
face O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
dog O
clamped O
down O
on O
my O
calf O
and O
I O
fell O
, O
but O
luckily O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
gate O
. O

Out O
of O
breath O
and O
exhausted O
, O
I O
climbed O
up O
and O
over O
and O
into O
the O
courtyard O
. O

Since O
nobody O
was O
paying O
attention O
to O
me O
, O
I O
slowly O
walked O
away O
. O

Heindl B-PERS
Haindl O
called O
me O
over O
and O
asked O
me O
to O
show O
them O
my O
leg O
. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
them O
. O

Blood O
was O
running O
down O
my O
calf O
. O

Let O
them O
put O
some O
iodine O
on O
it O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
give O
me O
another O
set O
of O
clothes O
, O
said O
Heindl B-PERS
Haindl O
. O

I O
walked O
away O
happy O
, O
since O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
worse O
. O

As O
I O
was O
crossing O
the O
large O
courtyard O
, O
I O
heard O
Rahm B-PERS
talking O
to O
the O
dog O
again O
and O
I O
saw O
him O
sic O
the O
dog O
on O
me O
again O
. O

Where O
to O
now O
? O
I O
looked O
around O
and O
didn’t O
see O
anything O
that O
would O
protect O
me O
, O
but O
a O
truck O
was O
parked O
there O
and O
so O
I O
ran O
, O
hoping O
to O
climb O
up O
onto O
the O
hood O
. O

The O
dog O
ran O
after O
me O
. O

I O
extended O
my O
foot O
toward O
the O
dog O
, O
kicked O
and O
barked O
at O
it O
, O
and O
then O
it O
dawned O
on O
me O
that O
the O
animal O
also O
has O
to O
do O
whatever O
the O
Germans B-LOC
tell O
it O
to O
do O
. O

Like O
we O
all O
do O
. O

The O
dog O
was O
called O
back O
and O
I O
was O
out O
of O
danger O
. O

Until O
1942 B-DATE
I O
lived O
with O
my O
parents O
in O
Prague B-LOC

We O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
apartment O
in O
one O
night O
and O
were O
placed O
on O
transport O
Ba O
. O

My O
father O
, O
since O
he O
was O
an O
important O
businessman O
, O
was O
exempt O
and O
I O
left O
for O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
with O
my O
sick O
mother O
. O

We O
were O
left O
with O
only O
our O
bags O
, O
everything O
else O
fell O
to O
the O
Kleiderkammer O
, O
to O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
doing O
pretty O
well O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

I O
worked O
in O
the O
garden O
and O
sometimes O
, O
although O
it O
was O
very O
dangerous O
, O
since O
I O
could O
be O
searched O
by O
the O
police O
and O
arrested O
, O
I O
would O
bring O
some O
vegetables O
for O
my O
parents O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
sometimes O
even O
that O
wasn’t O
enough O
, O
and O
so O
they O
suffered O
from O
hunger O
, O
as O
almost O
all O
the O
other O
old O
people O
. O

I O
later O
got O
married O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
since O
I O
was O
worried O
that O
I O
would O
be O
separated O
from O
my O
husband O
and O
so O
that O
, O
if O
we O
were O
transported O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
we O
would O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
same O
transport O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
husband O
was O
put O
on O
the O
first O
of O
the O
October O
transports O
, O
which O
were O
only O
for O
men O
, O
and O
taken O
away O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
where O
, O
according O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
eyewitnesses O
, O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
other O
side O
, O
to O
be O
gassed O
. O

One O
week O
later O
, O
I O
was O
also O
transported O
, O
believing O
that O
I O
was O
going O
to O
be O
with O
my O
husband O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
that O
14 O
days O
after O
my O
departure O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
I O
was O
placed O
on O
a O
labor O
transport O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Shortly O
after O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
I O
became O
gravely O
ill O
. O

I O
got O
a O
high O
fever O
and O
diarrhea O
and O
they O
threatened O
that O
I O
would O
be O
put O
on O
a O
sick O
transport O
and O
taken O
straight O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
felt O
better O
, O
I O
went O
– O
still O
a O
bit O
sick O
– O
back O
to O
work O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
I O
survived O
. O

I O
suffered O
through O
, O
like O
many O
others O
, O
terrible O
hunger O
and O
cold O
. O

Several O
times O
, O
I O
collapsed O
from O
exhaustion O
at O
my O
machine O
. O

Our O
German B-LOC
master O
was O
so O
nice O
that O
he O
threw O
me O
into O
some O
kind O
of O
box O
, O
left O
me O
lying O
there O
, O
and O
hid O
me O
from O
the O
SS O
. O

Although O
once O
the O
female O
commander O
did O
find O
me O
. O

They O
poured O
cold O
water O
on O
me O
and O
I O
had O
to O
continue O
working O
. O

And O
so O
I O
returned O
to O
Prague B-LOC
after O
so O
much O
suffering O
. O

My O
parents O
also O
died O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

I O
remained O
alone O
with O
my O
widowed O
sister O
who O
came O
back O
from O
Bergen B-CAMP
- O
Belsen B-CAMP
. O

I’m O
21 O

want O

From O
memory O

because O
documents O
had O

all O
burned O
- O
I O
will O
try O

up O

to O

For O
how O
long O
? O
Will O
we O
meet O
again O
? O
Those O
are O
the O
thoughts O
and O
questions O
of O
the O
fearful O
barracks O
internees O

The O
first O
crucial O
task O
of O

be O
carried O

One O
tries O
with O
all O
means O
to O
calm O
things O
down O
, O
the O
crying O
of O
the O
women O
and O
children O
is O
indescribable O
. O

The O
first O
revolution O
: O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
is O
stormed O
, O
the O
small O
room O
in O
which O
the O
entire O
staff O
officiates O
on O
suitcases O
is O
besieged O
by O
the O
women O
. O

The O
gendarmerie O
warns O
and O
demands O
immediate O
calm O
and O
order O
, O
because O
the O
consequences O
of O
an O
SS B-ORG
visit O
in O
this O
situation O
would O
be O
incalculable O
. O

The O
ghetto O
guard O
intervenes O
for O
the O
first O
time O

Hundreds O
of O
women O
are O
lined O
up O
and O
a O
tripartite O
deputation O
is O
supposed O
to O
negotiate O
with O
the O
Jewish O
elders O
. O

It O
is O
already O
dark O
, O
the O
excitement O
will O
be O
alleviated O
in O
a O
short O
time O
by O
the O
promised O
intervention O
and O
negotiation O
. O

The O
deputation O
demands O
that O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
immediately O
annul O
the O
ordered O
separation O
of O
families O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
, O
the O
clever O
politician O
to O
whom O
the O
negotiations O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
are O
nothing O
new O
, O
because O
for O
two O
years O
as O
head O
of O
the O
Palestine O
Office O
in O
Prague B-LOC
he O
was O
not O
only O
in O
the O
first O
Jewish O
camp O
in O
Nisko B-LOC
, O
which O
lasted O
only O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
but O
was O
offered O
a O
sufficient O
preview O
for O
the O
coming O
Jewish O
camps O
as O
he O
had O
also O
been O
sent O
to O
Holland B-LOC
by O
the O
SS O
authorities O
in O
order O
to O
create O
a O
Jewish O
organization O
based O
on O
the O
Prague B-LOC
model O
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
spokesmen O
for O
the O
many O
Prague B-LOC
citizens O
who O
had O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
every O
day O
. O

He O
already O
had O
sufficient O
experience O
with O
an O
SS B-ORG
order O
to O
explain O
that O
, O
You O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
commandant O
's O
office O
today O
was O
the O
demand O
of O
the O
deputation O
. O

E. B-PERS
knew O
that O
changing O
or O
canceling O
the O
order O
is O
not O
ruled O
out O
today O
or O
tomorrow O
. O

I O
am O
now O
going O
to O
the O
headquarters O
and O
will O
present O
your O
wishes O
and O
bitters O
. O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
E B-PERS
came O
back O
- O
the O
camp O
commander O
today O
would O
not O
receive O
him O
today.- O
In O
reality O
, O
he O
had O
never O
left O
the O
barracks O
because O
he O
could O
not O
leave O
the O
barracks O
without O
police O
escort O
or O
without O
an O
order O
of O
the O
camp O
command O
. O

The O
whole O
night O
was O
filled O
with O
thoughts O
of O
what O
the O
morning O
would O
bring O
, O
nobody O
thought O
of O
sleeping O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Zucker B-PERS
are O
ordered O
to O
the O
headquarters O
, O
as O
foreseen O
no O
change O
can O
be O
achieved O
- O
in O
the O
afternoon O
the O
women O
and O
children O
have O
to O
move O
to O
the O
Dresdenbarracks O
that O
have O
been O
vacated O
by O
the O
military O
. O

Columns O
loaded O
with O
rucksacks O
and O
the O
like O
are O
formed O
under O
the O
guard O
of O
the O
gendarmerie O
and O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

The O
sad O
train O
starts O
moving O
and O
wanders O
through O
the O
city O
to O
the O
barracks O
10 O
minutes O
away O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
few O
hours O
before O
the O
last O
women O
and O
children O
reach O
their O
new O
home O
. O

As O
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
so O
it O
is O
in O
this O
much O
larger O
and O
oldest O
barracks O
with O
3 O
courtyards O
. O

Empty O
, O
cold O
rooms O
, O
many O
forgot O
to O
take O
this O
and O
that O
out O
of O
the O
man O
's O
suitcase O
, O
the O
second O
sleepless O
night O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
work O
, O
plaster O
and O
other O
columns O
formed O
among O
the O
men O
to O
provide O
the O
helpless O
women O
the O
essentials O
in O
their O
barracks O
and O
help O
there O
. O

Everyone O
wants O
to O
see O
their O
wife O
child O
etc O
. O

It O
doesn't O
work O
, O
because O
only O
30 O
- O
50 O
men O
are O
supposed O
to O
do O
this O
service O
in O
the O
mornings O
and O
afternoons O
. O

The O
commandant O
's O
office O
promotes O
workers O
for O
this O
and O
that O
. O

An O
attempt O
is O
being O
made O
to O
introduce O
a O
rotation O
so O
that O
everyone O
can O
get O
to O
the O
Dresden B-LOC
barracks O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
gendarmerie O
turns O
a O
blind O
eye O
and O
they O
manage O
to O
order O
several O
times O
a O
day O
. O

But O
this O
joy O
of O
meeting O
is O
not O
complete O
. O

Talking O
to O
the O
women O
and O
children O
is O
only O
possible O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
and O
one O
is O
under O
constant O
danger O
, O
because O
an O
SS O
man O
could O
appear O
at O
any O
moment O
, O
the O
sexes O
must O
remain O
separate O
- O
that O
is O
the O
order O
. O

Any O
meeting O
in O
a O
courtyard O
let O
alone O
in O
a O
room O
is O
a O
criminal O
offense O
. O

And O
then O
a O
man O
who O
is O
just O
saying O
goodbye O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
child O
in O
the O
courtyard O
is O
seen O
by O
the O
SD B-ORG
man I-ORG
. O

Some O
punches O
and O
carting O
off O
for O
arrest O
is O
the O
end O
of O
this O
innocent O
day O
. O

Every O
little O
thing O

whether O

or O
only O
the O
arbitrariness O
of O
an O

in O

Like O
every O

the O

The O
first O
monthly O
report O
on O
the O
activities O
in O
the O
ghetto O
by O
the O
camp O
authorities O
to O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Berlin B-LOC
says O
in O
part O
: O
In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
proliferation O
of O
Jews O
- O
understand O
destruction O
- O
the O
accommodation O
of O
the O
sexes O
, O
the O
reduction O
of O
food O
to O
the O
smallest O
number O
of O
calories O
and O
so O
on O
was O
ordered O
. O

The O
staff O
usually O
works O
at O
night O
in O
a O
small O
room O
and O
issues O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
day O
, O
these O
are O
orders O
from O
the O
camp O
administration O
. O

Before O
Christmas O
, O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
/ O
Edelstein B-PERS
/ O
received O
the O
order O
to O
move O
his O
staff O
from O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
. O

The O
staff O
is O
supposed O
to O
separate O
itself O
from O
the O
ghetto O
inmates O
, O
establish O
its O
own O
kitchen O
, O
etc O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
rejects O
the O
latter O
under O
various O
excuses O
, O
whereupon O
the O
camp O
commandant O
calls O
him O
a O
communist O
. O

But O
the O
eloquent O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
experienced O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
knows O
how O
to O
convince O
the O
camp O
commandant O
. O

He O
selected O
not O
the O
SS B-ORG
-offered O
building O
but O
the O
Magdeburg B-LOC
barracks O
for O
the O
staff O
. O

I O
want O
to O
disappear O
into O
the O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
with O
the O
others O
, O
otherwise O
the O
SS O
will O
sniff O
away O
at O
us O
in O
our O
own O
building O
, O
this O
is O
how O
he O
explains O
its O
position O
on O
the O
segregation O
of O
the O
staff O
. O

The O
communication O
between O
the O
barracks O
and O
the O
connection O
between O
the O
relatives O
is O
very O
difficult O
due O
to O
the O
separation O
of O
the O
sexes O
. O

Passes O
are O
issued O
by O
the O
camp O
office O
to O
those O
people O
who O
may O
have O
to O
visit O
one O
or O
the O
other O
barracks O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

The O
management O
or O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
into O
which O
the O
staff O
was O
converted O
makes O
suggestions O
to O
the O
camp O
administrator O
about O
each O
individual O
case O
. O

There O
are O
party O
leaders O
with O
so O
many O
men O
who O
can O
lead O
the O
work O
groups O
from O
one O
barracks O
to O
another O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
a O
gendarmerie O
or O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

So O
you O
help O
the O
barracked O
to O
see O
each O
other O
and O
speak O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

More O
orders O

The O
council O
of O
elders O
leaves O
the O
headquarters O
and O
deliberates O
in O
the O
Magdeburg B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
. O

A O
terrible O
session O
! O
The O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O

is O
called O
to O
the O
Jewish O
elders O

Under O

This O

The O

the O
technical O

has O
to O
prepare O
the O
gallows O
coffins O
and O
a O
mass O
grave O
right O

A O

another O

In O
the O

of O
the O
head O

the O
ghetto O
guard O
, O
the O
ropes O
for O
the O
hands O

are O
tied O
together O
from O

the O

Nobody O

and O
even O
they O
don't O
know O
for O
whom O
everything O

So O
the O
night O
is O
passed O
sleepless O
by O
the O
initiated O

At O
6 O
o'clock O
in O

War O
, O
stand O
in O
front O
of O
their O
commandant O
and O
look O
at O
him O
questioningly O
, O
not O
a O
word O
falls O
from O
the O
ranks O
. O

The O
commandant O
explains O
it O
must O
be O
and O
you O
must O
execute O
this O
order O
from O
the O
SS B-ORG
against O
the O
victims O
as O
a O
final O

The O

steps O
forward O

the O
firing O
squad O
is O
composed O
of O

the O
Jewish O

A O
short O
consultation O
follows O
and O
Bergel B-PERS
leaves O
the O
barracks O

The O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O

is O
appointed O
as O
the O
Jewish O

The O
Jewish O

Edelstein B-PERS

his O
deputy O
Ing O

Zucker B-PERS
and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
are O
gathered O
in O
the O
small O
room O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
says O
to O
the O
latter O
: O
At O
½ O
ten O
o'clock O
you O
have O
to O
bring O
up O
two O
individuals O
with O
vile O
repute O
as O
executioners O
. O

This O
is O
the O
command O
I O
just O
received O
from O
UStf O
. O

Bergel B-PERS
and O
to O
whom O
you O
have O
to O
report O
to O
the O
execution O
office O
. O

A O
short O
, O
wordless O
pause O
. O

Who O
am O
I O
to O
call O
the O
most O
foul O
and O
who O
should O
I O
expect O
them O
to O
do O
? O
Asks O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

A O
long O
debate O
is O
now O
unfolding O
. O

One O
ponders O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
whom O
to O
entrust O
this O
terrible O
task O
. O

Time O
is O
running O
out O
and O
it O
is O
almost O
nine O
o'clock O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
go O
soon O
and O
get O
the O
hangman O
on O
board O
in O
time O
, O
Bergel B-PERS
will O
entrust O
you O
with O
the O
hangman O
's O
task O
or O
shoot O
you O
, O
says O
Edelstein B-PERS
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
as O
ordered O
, O
the O
building O
elders O
of O
the O
barracks O
assemble O
in O
front O
of O
the O
room O
of O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
, O
because O
both O
they O
and O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
must O
be O
present O
as O
spectators O
for O
the O
gruesome O
act O
. O

Both O
the O
civilian O
population O
and O
the O
barracked O
ghetto O
inmates O
were O
forbidden O
from O
entering O
the O
streets O
and O
courtyards O
at O
night O
, O
and O
from O
lingering O
by O
the O
windows O
. O

All O
streets O
are O
manned O
by O
the O
gendarmerie O
to O
monitor O
the O
strict O
orders O
of O
the O
camp O
authorities O
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
asks O
the O
building O
elder O
of O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
/there O
are O
several O
thousand O
men/ O
to O
accompany O
him O
. O

The O
2 O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
barracks O
gate O
. O

Fog O
, O
empty O
streets O
and O
windows O
, O
only O
the O
patrolling O

can O
be O
seen O
. O

Icy O
cold O
- O
it O
's O
way O
below O
20 O

below O

Do O
you O
know O
what O
I'm O
thinking O
about O
? O
We O
will O
call O
all O
the O
butchers O
of O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
together O
and O
ask O
for O
two O
people O
to O
do O
the O
terrible O
job O
as O
volunteers O
, O
because O
they O
could O
most O
likely O
take O
on O
such O
a O
job O
and O
not O
torture O
the O
victims O
. O

That O
was O
the O
only O
exchange O
between O
the O
two O
of O
them O
. O

Right O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
is O
the O
gendarmerie O
and O
ghetto O
guard O
room O
and O
next O
to O
it O
the O
fully O
filled O
detention O
rooms O
. O

Besides O
the O
normal O
guard O
, O
15 O
gendarmes O
are O
gathered O
in O
the O
guard O
room O
. O

The O
suspect O
, O
what O
is O
to O
come O
, O
but O
those O
doomed O
to O
death O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
! O
The O
guard O
room O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
is O
cleared O
, O
while O
the O
building O
elder O
alerts O
the O
butchers O
. O

In O
a O
few O
minutes O
eight O
men O
appear O
in O
the O
guard O
room O
. O

How O
old O
are O
you O
? O
Seventeen O
! O
And O
you O
? O
Eighteen O
! O
And O
you O
? O
Sixty O
. O

You O
three O
can O
go O
away O
, O
says O
the O
head O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
. O

Five O
men O
remain O
. O

I O
have O
a O
sad O
message O
but O
also O
an O
urgent O
request O
for O
you O
! O
Some O
of O
our O
comrades O
have O
been O
sentenced O
to O
die O
by O
hanging O
. O

The O
sentence O
will O
be O
carried O
out O
at O
10 O
a.m O
. O

and O
two O
of O
you O
must O
carry O
it O
out O
. O

I O
am O
to O
appoint O
the O
two O
most O
foul O
of O
the O
ghetto O
individuals O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
that O
is O
the O
order O
of O
the O
USTführer O
Bergel B-PERS
. O

I O
cannot O
carry O
out O
this O
order O
. O

But O
I O
ask O
you O
voluntarily O
to O
take O
on O
this O
terrible O
task O
. O

All O
pale O
. O

I O
am O
diabetic O
and O
have O
2 O
small O
children O
, O
I O
was O
in O
the O
World O
War O
, O
I O
have O
several O
medals O
for O
bravery O
, O
and O
afterwards O
I O
was O
a O
police O
sergeant O
, O
but O
I O
cannot O
take O
on O
this O
task O
! O
So O
nothing O
remains O
but O
to O
draw O
lots O
. O

The O
four O
names O
are O
thrown O
in O
pieces O
in O
the O
hat O
- O
it O
should O
determine O
the O
lot O
! O
At O
this O
moment O
a O
short O
, O
broad O
- O
shouldered O
, O
almost O
overgrown O
man O
enters O
. O

I O
should O
report O
here O
, O
what O
is O
it O
? O
After O
repeating O
the O
intended O
task O
, O
the O
man O
says O
: O
I'll O
take O
on O
this O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
hanging O
is O
it O
? O
This O
or O
that O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
in O
the O
anatomical O
pathological O
institute O
, O
and O
later O
an O
assistant O
to O
the O
hangman O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

Now O
he O
asks O
a O
young O
22 O
year O
old O
man O
to O
take O
over O
the O
work O
with O
him O
. O

He O

much O
else O
produced O
in O
the O
most O
precious O

execution O
. O

Scholars O
are O
assigned O
to O
research O
work O
by O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
which O
then O
appears O
under O
other O
names O
as O
the O
work O
of O
Germanscholars O
. O

The O
hot O
summer O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
strongest O
transports O
. O

The O
statistical O
breakdown O
shows O
more O
than O
half O
of O
over O
- O
aged O
people O
over O
65 O
years O
old O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
illnesses O
and O
deaths O
are O
increasing O
. O

150 O
- O
160 O
people O
die O
every O
day O
. O

All O
men O
and O
women O
able O
to O
work O
are O
particularly O
involved O
in O
production O
for O
the O
German B-LOC
army O
administration O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
export O
items O
and O
in O
agriculture O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
staff O
for O
internal O
service O
- O
for O
caring O
for O
the O
elderly O
and O
the O
sick O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
burying O
of O
the O
daily O
dead O
is O
not O
manageable O
either O
. O

500 O
corpses O
are O
unburied O
on O
hot O
days O
. O

Men O
who O
are O
able O
to O
work O
have O
to O
dig O
the O
mass O
graves O
at O
night O
after O
their O
daytime O
work O
. O

So O
3 O
times O
15 O
coffins O
are O
layered O
one O
on O
top O
of O
the O
other O
in O
the O
pits O
filled O
with O
water O
- O
there O
is O
groundwater O
already O
60 O
cm O
below O
the O
ground O
. O

While O
the O
deceased O
were O
previously O
stored O
in O
the O
barracks O
and O
houses O
and O
was O
then O
collected O
with O
the O
striped O
wagon O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
in O
the O
casemates O
a O
central O
morgue O
has O
been O
established O
where O
the O
bodies O
are O
put O
in O
coffins O
, O
simply O
hewn O
from O
rough O
boards O
. O

How O
the O
previous O
funerals O
in O
the O
barracks O
affected O
the O
inmates O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
. O

The O
barracks O
inmates O
and O
children O
watched O
the O
loading O
of O
the O
coffins O
and O
could O
escort O
the O
dead O
to O
the O
barracks O
gate O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
the O
gendarme O
accompanies O
them O
. O

The O
collection O
of O
corpses O
and O
delivery O
to O
the O
central O
mortuary O
was O
primitive O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
suitable O
vehicles O
. O

Small O
wagons O
drive O
through O
the O
city O
with O
several O
corpses O
on O
board O
, O
transported O
with O
insufficient O
blankets O
through O
the O
whole O
day O
. O

The O
morgue O
was O
located O
on O
the O
street O
from O

. I-GHETTO

train O
station O
, O
which O
the O
incoming O
transports O
had O
to O
pass O
. O

The O
new O
arrivals O
encountered O
this O
mass O
transport O
of O
corpses O
almost O
every O
day O
. O

What O
was O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
those O
expelled O
from O
their O
homeland O
and O
marching O
in O
columns O
into O
the O
ghetto O
when O
they O
saw O
these O
pictures O
? O
Sooner O
or O
later O
I O
too O
will O
be O
led O
away O
like O
this O
- O
had O
to O
be O
almost O
everyone O

thoughts O
. O

Several O
times O
a O
day O
a O
flat O
wagon O
with O
30 O
or O
more O
coffins O
drove O
from O
the O
central O
mortuary O
to O
the O

outside O
the O

- O
a O
large O

again O
on O
the O
street O
past O
the O
newcomers O
with O
2 O
- O
3 O
men O
and O
a O
gendarme O
as O
escort O
. O

The O
few O
flat O
cars O
are O
used O
to O
transport O
material O
and O
dead O
, O
but O
hearses O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
do O
come O
to O
the O
ghetto O
. O

One O
of O
the O
first O
hearses O
that O
the O
ghetto O
received O
was O
used O
for O
transport O
of O
bread O
and O
food O
, O
carried O
the O
inscription O
child O
welfare O
and O
was O
dragged O
through O
the O
ghetto O
by O
the O
young O
people O
. O

There O
were O
only O
a O
few O
pairs O
of O
horses O
and O
these O
were O
intended O
for O
agriculture O
, O
while O
all O
other O
transport O
had O
to O
be O
done O
by O
human O
hands O
. O

Between O
August B-DATE
and O
September B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
the O
ghetto O
reached O
a O
population O
of O
38,000 O

The O
transport O
movement O
to O

from O
the O
ghetto O
movement O
to O
the O

amounted O
to O
27,000 O
people O
in O
that O
month O
. O

On O
some O
days O
1,000 O
- O
3,000 O
people O
arrived O
and O
almost O
as O
many O

. O

The O
work O
associated O
with O
the O
accommodation O
, O

, O
sanitary O

. O

was O
enormous O

More O
than O
10,000 O

had O
to O
be O

in O
the O

of O
the O

been O
compiled O
mostly O
from O
those O
able O
to O

to O
the O

suddenly O
came O
the O
announcement O
that O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
June B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
men O

columns O
accompanied O
by O
the O
ghetto O

were O
brought O
into O
the O
Magdeburg B-LOC

It O
was O
a O
terrible O
sight O
to O
see O
the O
sick O
, O
malnourished O
people O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
corridors O
of O
the O
barracks O
, O

on O
the O
night O
when O
the O
registration O
took O
place O

The O
90 O

100 O
year O
old O
people O
didn't O
know O
what O
was O
happening O
to O
them O
or O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

The O
assistants O
employed O
by O
the O

had O
to O
record O
the O
national O

situation O
- O
especially O
where O
the O
children O
, O
possibly O
including O
the O

The O
instructions O
of O

Like O
all O
previous O
promises O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
this O
news O
was O
of O
course O
a O
lie O

a O

because O
they O
were O
heading O
towards O
destruction O

as O
we O

describe O
later O

In O
the O

It O
is O
not O
for O
nothing O
that O
these O
women O
were O
called O
berušky O
for O
their O
national O
duty O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
controls O
, O
the O
SS O
often O
appears O
under O
the O
assistance O
of O
gendarmes O
who O
occupy O
the O
barracks O
or O
the O
house O
- O
often O
for O
visits O
. O

Severe O
punishment O
, O
torture O
are O
the O
consequences O
if O
tobacco O
products O
, O
money O
or O
other O
prohibited O
items O
are O
found O
. O

In O
the O
commandant O
's O
office O
, O
many O
people O
are O
tortured O
to O
death O
in O
the O
most O
terrible O
way O
if O
they O
do O
not O
reveal O
the O
place O
or O
person O
where O
the O
things O
came O
from O
. O

Significantly O
how O
foreign O
the O
ghetto O
Th B-GHETTO
. O

is O
represented O
by O
many O
episodes O
like O
the O
first O
transport O
’ O
s O
arrival O
from O
Holland B-LOC
. O

The O
Dutch B-LOC
Jews O
are O
first O
led O
into O
the O
lock O
at O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
. O

White O
- O
covered O
tables O
are O
set O
up O
in O
the O
courtyard O
at O
which O
those O
who O
have O
arrived O
are O
entertained O
: O
Goulash O
, O
coffee O
, O
cake O
- O
. O

A O
photo O
session O
follows O
. O

Then O
everyone O
receives O
a O
postcard O
on O
which O
he O
announces O
the O
happy O
arrival O
and O
has O
to O
communicate O
hospitality O
to O
relatives O
or O
friends O
. O

After O
the O
cards O
have O
been O
removed O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
to O
the O
body O
and O
baggage O
control O
. O

At O
this O
point O
all O
luggage O
that O
the O
entertained O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
was O
removed O
, O
leaving O
only O
what O
was O
on O
the O
body O
. O

Not O
even O
the O
prostheses O
of O
the O
war O
invalids O
, O
which O
those O
around O
Germany O
earned O
and O
many O
decorated O
former O
soldiers O
brought O
with O
them O
, O
were O
spared O
the O
robbery O
. O

These O
were O
the O
sponsored O
Jews O
from O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
camp O
, O
who O
were O
transported O
to O
the O
model O
ghetto O
and O
not O
to O
the O
east O
. O

Before O
leaving O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
camp O
, O
those O
chosen O
for O
Terezín B-GHETTO
are O
asked O
to O
take O
everything O
with O
them O
, O
so O
that O
the O
robbery O
of O
the O
SD B-ORG
was O
particularly O
fruitful O
. O

To O
reinforce O
the O
SD B-ORG
, O
there O
are O
5 O
19 O
- O
20 O
year O
old O
SS O
men O
who O
are O
primarily O
employed O
as O
tractor O
drivers O
. O

The O
ghetto O
had O
received O
a O
few O
tractors O
with O
trailers O
for O
the O
entire O
transport O
service O
of O
material O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
driving O
skills O
of O
this O
SSyouth O
home O
, O
as O
they O
were O
called O
, O
cost O
many O
lives O
. O

The O
heroic O
SS O
drivers O
ran O
people O
over O
for O
pleasure O
, O
not O
just O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
but O
on O
purpose O
. O

So O
the O
ones O
who O
arrived O
are O
transported O
, O
with O
the O
sick O
patients O
and O
those O
unable O
to O
walk O
crammed O
standing O
into O
two O
sidecars O
; O
on O
the O
road O
from O
Bohušovice B-LOC

Terezín B-GHETTO
27 O

they O
lay O

the O

the O

seriously O
injured O
, O
in O
which O
others O
died O
of O
their O
injuries O
, O
the O
survivors O
remain O
cripples O
. O

The O
boys O
tried O
their O
pistols O
against O
living O
targets O
on O
various O
occasions O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
were O
drunk O
. O

The O
message O
to O
the O
camp O

read O
: O
shot O
for O
insubordination O

The O
way O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
greet O
members O
of O
the O
SD B-ORG
and O
the O
government O
gendarmerie O
was O
particularly O
effective O
. O

According O
to O
the O
camp O
regulations O
, O
the O
men O
had O
to O
greet O
the O
aforementioned O
by O
exposing O
their O
heads O
and O
the O
women O
by O
bowing O
. O

Old O
people O
, O
who O
for O
reasons O
of O
short O
- O
sightedness O
or O
other O
reasons O
did O
not O
greet O
the O
SS O
properly O
, O
often O
had O
their O
headgear O
knocked O
off O
. O

Blows O
to O
the O
head O
or O
kicks O
were O
the O
encore O
. O

The O
aged O
people O
hardly O
knew O
why O
they O
were O
being O
treated O
this O
way O

When O
our O
homeland O
was O
occupied O
by O
Hitler B-PERS
and O
transformed O
into O
a O
German O
protectorate B-LOC
, O
we O
lived O
in O
Brno B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
a O
doctor O
in O
a O
Sanatorium O
in O
Brno B-LOC
, O
and O
my O
wife O
helped O
my O
mother O
with O
business O
and O
sewed O
with O
my O
sister O
in O
her O
tailor O
's O
workshop O
. O

We O
lived O
together O
in O
a O
small O
2 O
bedroom O
apartment O
. O

We O
sensed O
that O
the O
arrival O
of O
Hitler B-PERS
meant O
disaster O
for O
us O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
acute O
danger O
clearly O
and O
immediately O
before O
us O
. O

Those O
possibly O
could O
ran O
away O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
get O
away O
. O

The O
rich O
were O
long O
gone O
, O
the O
less O
well O
- O
off O
remained O
. O

A O
wave O
of O
suicides O
wiped O
out O
the O
weak O
, O
who O
did O
not O
feel O
up O
to O
the O
threat O
of O
danger O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
braced O
themselves O
with O
all O
their O
moral O
strength O
to O
hold O
out O
for O
whatever O
else O
might O
come O
. O

We O
made O
some O
more O
desperate O
attempts O
. O

My O
sister O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
with O
an O
illegal O
transport O
. O

She O
recoiled O
from O
the O
uncertain O
fate O
and O
hardships O
. O

She O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
with O
her O
life O
. O

My O
brother O
, O
an O
emigration O
consultant O
, O
specialist O
in O
all O
questions O
of O
emigration O
, O
helped O
some O
people O
to O
get O
out O
, O
but O
he O
himself O
got O
stuck O
just O
before O
the O
finish O
line O
. O

He O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
with O
his O
life O
. O

My O
Erna B-PERS
and O
I O
had O
an O
American B-LOC
affidavit O
with O
a O
hopeless O
quota O
number O
, O
and O
a O
visa O
to O
Shanghai B-LOC
, O
hopeless O
from O
a O
transportation O
perspective O
. O

But O
that O
was O
not O
the O
point O
. O

I O
had O
a O
job O
that O
held O
me O
down O
with O
a O
thousand O
shackles O
. O

Near O
Brno B-LOC
was O
a O
factory O
that O
had O
been O
converted O
into O
a O
refugee O
camp O
. O

Jews O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
Jews O
from O
the O
Sudetenland B-LOC
, O
from O
Burgenland B-LOC
and O
elsewhere O
, O
hunted O
out O
of O
house O
and O
home O
, O
were O
rounded O
up O
here O
and O
concentrated O
under O
Gestapo B-ORG
supervision I-ORG
. O

They O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
camp O
and O
lived O
in O
inhumane O
conditions O
. O

Badly O
fed O
, O
poorly O
dressed O
, O
robbed O
to O
the O
last O
, O
deprived O
of O
their O
freedom O
of O
movement O
, O
beaten O
, O
broken O
, O
these O
people O
seemed O
to O
us O
the O
poorest O
of O
the O
poor O
. O

The O
Jews O
of O
Brno B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
still O
free O
to O
live O
in O
their O
apartments O
outside O
and O
had O
begun O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
first O
shock O
of O
the O
Anschluss O
, O
began O
to O
hear O
with O
horror O
the O
descriptions O
of O
how O
these O
poorest O
of O
the O
poor O
vegetated O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

How O
gladly O
we O
would O
have O
exchanged O
places O
with O
them O
later O
. O

This O
was O
something O
new O
, O
outrageous O
for O
us O
, O
but O
also O
a O
foreshadowing O
of O
what O
was O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

The O
doctor O
on O
duty O
in O
the O
camp O
ran O
away O
one O
day O
, O
unable O
to O
witness O
the O
cruelties O
of O
the O
SS O
. O

I O
was O
called O
to O
take O
his O
place O
. O

Despite O
all O
of O
my O
family O
’s O
warnings O
and O
complaints O
, O
I O
accepted O
the O
job O
and O
soon O
loved O
my O
work O
out O
there O
so O
much O
that O
it O
held O
me O
with O
greater O
force O
than O
my O
driving O
need O
to O
emigrate O
. O

Despite O
and O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
SS O
men O
, O
who O
visited O
the O
camp O
daily O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
set O
up O
a O
hospital O
and O
an O
emergency O
room O
, O
to O
organize O
care O
for O
children O
and O
the O
elderly O
, O
and O
to O
ease O
the O
lives O
of O
those O
interned O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
I O
was O
not O
intimidated O
, O
allowed O
me O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
I O
was O
even O
able O
to O
persuade O
them O
to O
help O
me O
in O
my O
efforts O
, O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
avoiding O
epidemics O
. O

And O
they O
were O
terrified O
of O
the O
spread O
of O
infectious O
diseases O
, O
because O
even O
the O
German O
supermen O
were O
not O
immune O
to O
them O
. O

At O
that O
time O
there O
were O
already O
actions O
there O
, O
albeit O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
than O
later O
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
the O
gentlemen O
of O
SS O
, O
mostly O
drunk O
, O
entertained O
themselves O
by O
making O
old O
men O
run O
in O
a O
circle O
for O
hours O
, O
or O
gymnastics O
, O
forcing O
boys O
to O
jump O
from O
upper O
floors O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

We O
were O
horrified O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
we O
saw O
something O
like O
this O
with O
our O
own O
eyes O
. O

How O
harmless O
these O
entertainments O
were O
compared O
to O
what O
came O
later O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
also O
had O
my O
practice O
in O
Brno B-LOC
, O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
do O
, O
had O
the O
immense O
luck O
of O
having O
a O
beloved O
wife O
with O
me O
, O
and O
gradually O
we O
got O
used O
to O
the O
conditions O
. O

On O
June B-DATE
20 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
day O
that O
the O
Germans O
invaded O
Russia B-LOC
, O
we O
( O
Erna B-PERS
and O
I O
) O
had O
to O
move O
to O
Eibenschütz B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
refugee O
camp O
was O
located O
, O
on O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

At O
first O
we O
were O
very O
unhappy O
about O
that O
, O
because O
that O
meant O
I O
had O
to O
give O
up O
the O
practice O
and O
thus O
a O
large O
part O
of O
my O
income O
. O

But O
soon O
we O
were O
satisfied O
with O
this O
change O
. O

We O
got O
a O
small O
, O
very O
nice O
apartment O
and O
we O
set O
it O
up O
to O
our O
taste O
. O

It O
was O
actually O
our O
first O
apartment O
together O
. O

Out O
there O
in O
the O
small O
town O
Hitler B-PERS
’s I-PERS
terror O
was O
not O
as O
noticable O
, O
because O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
Germans B-LOC
there O
. O

The O
Czech B-LOC
population O
helped O
us O
when O
they O
could O
, O
firstly O
because O
they O
liked O
us O
, O
secondly O
in O
protest O
against O
the O
Germans O
. O

For O
a O
while O
, O
it O
almost O
looked O
as O
if O
the O
Jewish O
question O
would O
take O
a O
back O
seat O
after O
all O
. O

If O
no O
action O
was O
taken O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
everyone O
took O
a O
breath O
, O
believing O
that O
the O
worst O
terror O
was O
over O
. O

I O
earned O
enough O
to O
ensure O
a O
carefree O
life O
; O
we O
were O
able O
to O
provide O
our O
people O
in O
Brno B-LOC
with O
all O
types O
of O
food O
, O
which O
was O
scarce O
; O
and O
we O
sent O
parcels O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
almost O
every O
day O
. O

There O
, O
Mother O
Knoll B-PERS
, O
Bronja B-PERS
and O
her O
two O
children O
were O
very O
dependent O
on O
it O
, O
because O
there O
it O
was O
much O
worse O
for O
Jews O
. O

There O
, O
something O
had O
long O
since O
begun O
that O
would O
later O
[ O
rob O
us O
] O
of O
rest O
and O
sleep O
- O
transports O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
what O
the O
word O
Transport O
did O
to O
Jews O
. O

No O
sooner O
had O
it O
been O
spoken O
than O
it O
lay O
like O
an O
alp O
in O
the O
landscape O
of O
every O
family O
, O
in O
every O
company O
, O
people O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
in O
shock O
, O
fear O
and O
horror O
marked O
on O
their O
foreheads O
. O

For O
transports O
meant O
forced O
deportation O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

You O
did O
not O
know O
that O
, O
but O
one O
thing O
was O
certain O
: O
it O
was O
a O
terrible O
thing O
. O

Thousands O
of O
people O
with O
packs O
drove O
on O
in O
cattle O
cars O
to O
face O
an O
uncertain O
but O
miserable O
fate O
. O

Here O
and O
there O
came O
letters O
or O
postcards O
from O
Poland B-LOC
, O
cries O
for O
help O
. O

They O
were O
starving O
, O
freezing O
, O
tormented O
by O
all O
the O
devils O
. O

One O
did O
not O
learn O
more O
, O
for O
no O
one O
dared O
to O
write O
the O
truth O
. O

All O
we O
knew O
was O
that O
the O
deported O
Jews O
lived O
and O
worked O
crammed O
in O
the O
ghetto O
. O

Their O
luggage O
was O
stolen O
from O
them O
, O
they O
got O
almost O
nothing O
to O
eat O
. O

My O
wife O
could O
not O
find O
peace O
. O

Every O
day O
she O
trembled O
at O
the O
news O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
fearing O
that O
her O
mother O
or O
the O
children O
would O
have O
to O
experience O
it O
. O

But O
they O
were O
spared O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

Erna B-PERS
organized O
an O
aid O
operation O
from O
Kiganen O
. O

She O
went O
from O
house O
to O
house O
, O
asking O
, O
begging O
, O
packing O
, O
and O
sending O
parcels O
, O
growing O
in O
her O
new O
job O
. O

Mountains O
of O
letters O
of O
thanks O
arrived O
. O

Soon O
we O
got O
used O
to O
it O
and O
the O
misery O
of O
the O
world O
became O
everyday O
. O

We O
ourselves O
lived O
almost O
as O
if O
in O
peace O
. O

Although O
the O
staggering O
Jewish O
decrees O
and O
daily O
persecution O
of O
Jews O
forced O
us O
to O
realize O
that O
Hitler B-PERS
was O
about O
to O
fulfill O
his O
Jewish O
program O
, O
that O
we O
were O
condemned O
to O
death O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
feel O
it O
, O
resisted O
it O
, O
we O
soaked O
our O
souls O
with O
indestructible O
optimism O
: O
The O
whole O
world O
was O
against O
Hitler B-PERS
, O
so O
the O
whole O
world O
helped O
us O
and O
each O
day O
had O
to O
bring O
us O
closer O
to O
the O
good O
end O
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
long O
in O
coming O
. O

But O
soon O
it O
started O
again O
, O
and O
blow O
over O
blow O
it O
overcame O
us O
. O

In O
Brno B-LOC
there O
were O
smaller O
scale O
actions O
. O

Streets O
were O
destroyed O
, O
all O
the O
men O
who O
were O
found O
, O
arrested O
and O
dragged O
away O
. O

A O
total O
of O
224 O
men O
. O

Within O
six O
days O
, O
222 O
stereotypical O
telegraphic O
death O
reports O
came O
, O
they O
had O
died O
in O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
, O
causes O
of O
death O
: O
angina O
, O
heart O
attack O
, O
pneumonia O
. O

The O
remaining O
two O
disappeared O
without O
a O
death O
report O
. O

Similar O
actions O
were O
repeated O
. O

Then O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
recover O
, O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
to O
revive O
the O
unfounded O
, O
or O
at O
least O
premature O
, O
optimism O
. O

All O
Jews O
and O
people O
of O
Jewish O
descent O
were O
registered O
and O
separated O
once O
and O
for O
all O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

An O
incalculable O
downpour O
of O
ordinances O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
other O
world O
. O

A O
flood O
of O
prohibitions O
and O
laws O
rained O
down O
. O

First O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wear O
a O
yellow O
star O
that O
marked O
everyone O
who O
was O
legally O
recognized O
as O
a O
Jew O
from O
afar O
. O

We O
were O
outlawed O
. O

No O
Aryan O
was O
allowed O
to O
speak O
with O
us O
. O

Half O
- O
grown O
rascals O
attacked O
the O
marked O
women O
and O
old O
people O
and O
beat O
them O
bloody O
, O
and O
in O
packs O
they O
attacked O
men O
and O
abused O
them O
too O
. O

One O
night O
I O
came O
from O
an O
ill O
person O
and O
was O
attacked O
. O

I O
came O
away O
with O
a O
broken O
nose O
and O
a O
few O
wounds O
from O
blows O
. O

My O
family O
could O
not O
recognize O
me O
when O
I O
was O
brought O
home O
. O

But O
all O
these O
were O
episodes O
and O
events O
that O
we O
accepted O
and O
suffered O
in O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
imminent O
end O
, O
which O
could O
not O
be O
long O
in O
coming O
. O

The O
Jews O
acquired O
a O
facial O
expression O
that O
made O
them O
recognizable O
, O
even O
if O
they O
had O
not O
worn O
the O
star O
. O

Fear O
, O
terror O
, O
restlessness O
in O
the O
eyes O
, O
slinking O
along O
the O
walls O
, O
always O
ready O
to O
be O
hit O
, O
slain O
, O
beaten O
to O
death O
. O

Only O
within O
their O
own O
four O
walls O
, O
among O
themselves O
, O
could O
they O
relax O
their O
nerves O
, O
open O
up O
, O
speak O
with O
eyes O
shining O
of O
the O
day O
of O
liberation O
, O
which O
had O
to O
come O
and O
would O
come O
soon O
. O

In O
spirit O
, O
our O
tormentors O
were O
caught O
, O
hanged O
, O
punished O
, O
and O
the O
better O
world O
we O
dreamed O
of O
arose O
in O
our O
mind O
's O
eye O
. O

After O
8pm O
no O
Jew O
was O
allowed O
on O
the O
street O
, O
and O
they O
could O
enter O
no O
restaurant O
, O
no O
cinema O
or O
theater O
. O

In O
the O
tram O
they O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
ride O
on O
the O
front O
platform O
of O
the O
sidecar O
. O

Those O
who O
lived O
in O
houses O
remained O
within O
, O
because O
they O
dared O
not O
go O
into O
the O
alley O
. O

And O
again O
restriction O
on O
top O
of O
restriction O
. O

Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
buy O
tobacco O
, O
fruit O
or O
vegetables O
, O
they O
could O
only O
pick O
up O
their O
laughable O
food O
rations O
at O
certain O
times O
. O

Radios O
, O
furs O
, O
cameras O
, O
luxury O
goods O
, O
binoculars O
, O
jewelry O
, O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
valuables O
had O
to O
be O
surrendered O
. O

Any O
evasion O
of O
these O
ordinances O
meant O
certain O
death O
. O

But O
everything O
could O
be O
endured O
. O

However O
, O
the O
great O
variable O
in O
life O
lay O
like O
an O
alp O
: O
transports O
. O

In O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
they O
had O
become O
an O
everyday O
event O
. O

Thousands O
of O
people O
went O
to O
Poland B-LOC
twice O
a O
week O
from O
there O
. O

Our O
protectorate B-LOC
had O
been O
spared O
until O
now O

In O
the O
autumn O
of O
1941 B-DATE
, O
it O
started O
to O
hit O
us O
. O

First O
, O
4 O
transports O
had O
to O
leave O
Prague B-LOC
, O
each O
with O
1000 O
people O
, O
to O
Lodz B-GHETTO
. O

The O
selection O
was O
completely O
arbitrary O
, O
rich O
, O
poor O
, O
healthy O
, O
old O
, O
children O
, O
ill O
. O

After O
each O
transport O
, O
handled O
with O
German O
thoroughness O
and O
cruelty O
, O
we O
hoped O
that O
it O
was O
the O
last O
one O
. O

But O
they O
kept O
on O
going O
; O
the O
longer O
the O
breaks O
between O
the O
transports O
lasted O
, O
the O
quicker O
the O
optimism O
returned O
. O

It O
was O
completely O
unfounded O
. O

Because O
with O
relentless O
regularity O
transport O
followed O
transport O
. O

On O
November B-DATE
19 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
first O
thousand O
people O
were O
taken O
from O
Brno B-LOC

My O
brother O
had O
to O
go O
. O

Was O
it O
useful O
to O
him O
that O
he O
became O
a O
transport O
leader O
? O
He O
had O
to O
go O
with O
his O
wife O
. O

The O
telephone O
conversation O
in O
which O
we O
said O
goodbye O
to O
each O
other O
was O
unforgettable O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
forever O
. O

I O
could O
not O
even O
take O
the O
30 O
km O
train O
to O
Brno B-LOC
to O
see O
him O
once O
, O
because O
it O
was O
forbidden O
for O
Jews O
. O

We O
both O
knew O
that O
we O
would O
not O
meet O
again O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
I O
swore O
I O
would O
never O
feel O
pity O
for O
a O
German O
when O
the O
time O
came O

He O
left O

They O
ended O
up O
in O
Minsk B-GHETTO

Russia B-LOC

Just O
last O
week O
, O
in O
Vienna B-LOC

I O
was O
able O
to O
sketch O
the O
details O
of O
his O
fate O
there O
when O
I O
was O
handed O
over O
his O
letters O
. O

The O
80,000 O
Jews O
residing O
in O
Minsk B-GHETTO
, O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Russian B-LOC
, O
were O
exterminated O
in O
mass O
executions O
. O

Under O
indescribable O
terror O
they O
had O
to O
dig O
their O
own O
mass O
graves O
, O
had O
to O
undress O
in O
the O
winter O
cold O
and O
stand O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
graves O
. O

Then O
they O
were O
shot O
down O
with O
machine O
guns O
, O
and O
fell O
backward O
into O
the O
grave O

The O
bodies O
were O
covered O

buried O
by O
the O
next O
victims O

whether O
they O
were O
dead O

alive O

Aryan O
eyewitnesses O
report O
that O
they O
saw O
the O
earth O
move O
for O
days O
afterwards O

Then O
the O
next O
shuffle O
came O
, O
until O
everyone O
was O
murdered O

Under O
the O
terror O
of O
submachine O
guns O
people O
dug O
their O

they O
did O

People O
, O
with O
senses O

In O
place O
of O
these O
unfortunates O

Jews O
were O
imported O
from O
all O
over O
Europe B-LOC

From O
Hamburg B-LOC

Berlin B-LOC

Prague B-LOC

They O
populated O
the O
ghetto O

the O
murdered O
, O
only O
to O
be O
exterminated O
themselves O
soon O
afterwards O
. O

They O
worked O
hard O
and O
suffered O
unspeakably O
from O
starvation O
and O
cold O
like O
all O
of O
their O
fellow O
- O
travelers O
. O

Most O
dropped O
dead O
, O
many O
were O
killed O
, O
some O
managed O
to O
stay O
above O
water O
. O

Including O
my O
brother O
. O

He O
was O
clever O
enough O
, O
not O
only O
to O
get O
a O
good O
job O
, O
but O
he O
also O
managed O
to O
send O
signs O
of O
life O
under O
the O
greatest O
mortal O
danger O
. O

There O
were O
a O
total O
of O
8 O
letters O
from O
him O
that O
could O
be O
published O
as O
they O
are O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
second O
he O
shared O
the O
death O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
whom O
he O
loved O
above O
all O
else O
. O

She O
had O
to O
undergo O
a O
stomach O
operation O

which O
was O
performed O
on O
a O
kitchen O
table O
with O
improvised O
instruments O

A O
good O
friend O
of O
mine O
performed O
it O
. O

Eight O
days O
later O
she O
died O
of O
complications O
. O

He O
only O
hinted O
at O
what O
they O
had O
experienced O
before O
that O
. O

Each O
action O
chased O
the O
last O
and O
, O
as O
everywhere O
in O
camps O
and O
ghettos O
, O
had O
the O
purpose O
of O
clearing O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
poorest O
of O
the O
poor O
and O
taking O
away O
the O
old O
, O
ill O
, O
and O
children O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
ballast O
, O
but O
to O
reach O
the O
quota O
ordered O
young O
and O
healthy O
people O
were O
taken O
too O
, O
to O
make O
room O
for O
the O
newly O
- O
arrived O
, O
like O
cattle O
to O
slaughter O
. O

The O
other O
letters O
are O
from O
a O
broken O
man O

Under O
infinite O
danger O
and O
difficulty O
, O
his O
Viennese B-LOC
friends O
sent O
him O
food O
that O
kept O
him O
alive O
. O

It O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
cleverness O
to O
avoid O
the O
racing O
actions O
. O

He O
succeeded O
until O
October B-DATE
1943 I-DATE
. O

Emaciated O
to O
the O
skeleton O
, O
he O
had O
lost O
over O
30 O
kg O
, O
deeply O
depressed O
about O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
resigned O
to O
his O
fate O
, O
he O
wrote O
his O
last O
, O
shocking O
letter O
in O
which O
he O
hinted O
at O
his O
imminent O
fate O
. O

The O
person O
who O
passed O
on O
his O
letter O
, O
who O
must O
have O
been O
very O
fond O
of O
him O
, O
added O
words O
in O
a O
trembling O
script O
that O
leave O
no O
doubt O
that O
he O
, O
too O
, O
was O
murdered O
, O
like O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
others O
. O

The O
only O
hope O
that O
remains O
is O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
to O
suffer O
, O
beyond O
what O
he O
went O
through O
before O
. O

But O
back O
to O
us O
. O

Transport O
after O
transport O
was O
completed O
, O
from O
Brno B-LOC
, O
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
from O
the O
provinces O
. O

It O
transpired O
that O
the O
transports O
no O
longer O
went O
to O
Poland B-LOC
but O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
a O
town O
on O
Czech B-LOC
soil O
, O
where O
a O
ghetto O
was O
being O
built O
. O

More O
and O
more O
friends O
had O
to O
leave O
, O
and O
our O
ranks O
cleared O
. O

The O
transports O
were O
always O
labeled O
with O
letters O
, O
the O
first O
with O
A O
, O
then O
B O
, O
C O
and O
so O
on O
. O

My O
brother O
had O
left O
with O
Transport O
F O
and O
from O
the O
day O
of O
his O
deportation O
until O
his O
death O
he O
had O
no O
name O
, O
but O
he O
was O
the O

F O
994 O
. O

When O
they O
were O
finished O
with O
the O
alphabet O
, O
double O
letters O
came O
up O
: O
Aa O
, O
Ab O
, O
Ac O
, O
etc O
. O

Weeks O
, O
months O
passed O
by O
. O

We O
felt O
fairly O
safe O
, O
because O
we O
had O
been O
assured O
by O
the O
Germans O
as O
well O
as O
from O
the O
Jewish O
side O
that O
we O
were O
indispensable O
and O
would O
not O
be O
deported O
. O

I O
was O
a O
licensed O
Jewish O
doctor O
/ O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
Jewish O
physicians O
were O
allowed O
to O
practice O
. O

/ O
And O
, O
next O
to O
the O
camp O
, O
a O
group O
of O
Jewish O
miners O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
armaments O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
families O
were O
not O
torn O
apart O
. O

If O
someone O
was O
deported O
, O
then O
it O
was O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
, O
or O
the O
family O
stayed O
home O
. O

As O
awful O
as O
the O
transports O
were O
, O
at O
Eibenschütz B-LOC
we O
only O
saw O
them O
from O
afar O
. O

We O
continued O
living O
our O
quiet O
, O
almost O
idyllic O
life O
there O
. O

Away O
from O
the O
horrors O
of O
terror O
, O
retreating O
to O
our O
beloved O
apartment O
, O
surrounded O
by O
good O
friends O
, O
supported O
and O
sustained O
by O
the O
open O
sympathy O
of O
the O
locals O
, O
fully O
engaged O
in O
satisfying O
work O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
we O
would O
survive O
this O
terrible O
time O
in O
this O
way O
and O
that O
it O
could O
not O
take O
much O
longer O
. O

In O
February B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
the O
big O
turning O
point O
in O
the O
war O
came O
: O
Stalingrad B-LOC
. O

Every O
day O
we O
got O
our O
reports O
, O
studied O
newspapers O
, O
listened O
to O
banned O
overseas O
broadcasts O
and O
longingly O
counted O
the O
days O
: O
how O
long O
it O
could O
take O
? O
We O
were O
aware O
of O
the O
evil O
times O
and O
yet O
no O
one O
could O
guess O
what O
awaited O
us O
. O

We O
saw O
before O
us O
the O
misery O
of O
camp O
life O
in O
Eibenschütz B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
also O
saw O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
make O
things O
easier O
for O
the O
children O
and O
the O
ill O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
and O
even O
gives O
them O
better O
lives O
than O
they O
could O
have O
outside O
, O
since O
Jewish O
children O
outside O
the O
camp O
were O
inhibited O
by O
wearing O
the O
Jewish O
star O
and O
forced O
to O
navigate O
a O
maze O
of O
prohibitions O
. O

After O
careful O
consideration O
, O
we O
came O
to O
the O
decision O
to O
have O
a O
child O
at O
this O
stage O
in O
life O
. O

We O
trusted O
in O
the O
inexorably O
approaching O
end O
of O
the O
war O
. O

We O
trusted O
in O
ourselves O

prepared O
everything O
. O

Nor O
do O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
, O
like O
everything O
else O
that O
she O
took O
up O
, O
she O
also O
managed O
the O
business O
with O
exemplary O
perfection O
. O

The O
times O
were O
difficult O
, O
she O
had O
no O
help O
, O
she O
had O
to O
help O
out O
with O
the O
practice O
and O
take O
care O
of O
the O
entire O
household O
. O

She O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
excellent O
cook O
, O
Peppi O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
it O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
her O
in O
her O
new O
element O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
how O
happily O
we O
were O
in O
those O
months O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
it O
all O
. O

Outside O
, O
the O
flood O
raged O
, O
murder O
, O
fire O
, O
misery O
, O
terror O
, O
but O
it O
seemed O
to O
stop O
at O
the O
doors O
of O
our O
home O
, O
which O
, O
like O
an O
island O
of O
peace O
and O
happiness O
, O
provided O
a O
sanctuary O
not O
only O
for O
us O
but O
for O
our O
friends O
as O
well O
. O

The O
pregnancy O
was O
nearing O
its O
end O
when O
it O
broke O
upon O
us O
. O

First O

1942 I-DATE
my O
mother O
became O
the O
number O
Af B-PERS
261 I-PERS
and O
had O
to O
enter O
the O
schleuse O
. O

No O
sooner O
had O
I O
said O
goodbye O
to O
her O
than O
we O
too O
were O
called O
up O
. O

From O
all O
sides O
we O
were O
assured O
that O
it O
was O
a O
mistake O
, O
we O
should O
not O
pack O
, O
because O
we O
were O
indispensable O
. O

The O
German O
director O
of O
the O
coal O
mine O
telephoned O
and O
telegraphed O
and O
informed O
me O
that O
I O
should O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
transport O
and O
he O
would O
take O
responsibility O
. O

I O
didn't O
do O
it O
, O
and O
shortly O
thereafter O
all O
the O
Jewish O
miners O
were O
lined O
up O
as O
well O
. O

Erna B-PERS
was O
due O
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
she O
already O
had O
a O
big O
belly O
. O

She O
packed O
for O
three O
, O
because O
we O
needed O
to O
bring O
everything O
for O
the O
child O
. O

She O
ironed O
, O
washed O
, O
organized O
, O
hid O
, O
sewed O
jewelry O
and O
gold O
into O
seams O
, O
was O
everywhere O
and O
did O
everything O
. O

She O
did O
not O
sleep O
for O
three O
days O
and O
three O
nights O
, O
then O
we O
were O
in O
the O
schleuse O
. O

My O
sister O
lined O
up O
next O
to O
us O
with O
her O
spouse O
in O
the O
school O
, O
which O
had O
been O
cleared O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

As O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
school O
, O
the O
free O
world O
closed O
behind O
us O
. O

We O
could O
not O
know O
that O
barely O
one O
percent O
of O
those O
who O
had O
passed O
through O
this O
gate O
would O
survive O
the O
war O
. O

The O
fall O
from O
the O
peaceful O
life O
of O
our O
home O
and O
our O
position O
into O
the O
deportation O
was O
a O
tremendous O
one O
. O

I O
did O
not O
feel O
it O
, O
because O
I O
was O
not O
spoiled O
and O
was O
trained O
in O
sports O
. O

But O
for O
a O
woman O
in O
her O
condition O
, O
it O
was O
terrible O
. O

Hundreds O
lay O
in O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
darkened O
classrooms O
. O

Cold O
, O
SS O
Terror O
, O
with O
shooting O
and O
beatings O
to O
intimidate O
us O
. O

We O
were O
dispatched O
in O
endless O
procedures O
, O
which O
still O
reminded O
us O
of O
normal O
life O
. O

Food O
cards O
, O
money O
, O
all O
documents O
, O
apartment O
keys O
, O
valuables O
. O

After O
three O
days O
, O
at O
night O
, O
so O
that O
the O
general O
population O
did O
not O
see O
what O
was O
happening O
to O
us O
, O
we O
were O
lined O
up O
in O
rows O
and O
chased O
to O
the O
station O
. O

SS O
guards O
had O
their O
fun O
beating O
old O
people O
to O
make O
them O
run O
, O
mocking O
and O
ridiculing O
them O
. O

We O
got O
into O
our O
train O
cars O
, O
the O
Jewish O
aid O
organization O
had O
done O
exemplary O
work O
, O
all O
luggage O
was O
stored O
in O
our O
Kupes O
ordered O
by O
numbers O
and O
the O
12 O
hour O
ride O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

Ah B-PERS
711 I-PERS
, O
which O
was O
once O
my O
wife O
, O
sat O
beside O
Ah B-PERS
712 I-PERS
and O
was O
happy O
, O
for O
it O
was O
rumoured O
that O
men O
and O
women O
were O
separated O
. O

Ah B-PERS
713 I-PERS
and O
Ah B-PERS
714 I-PERS
, O
sister O
and O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
rode O
with O
us O
. O

The O
first O
shock O
was O
overcome O
and O
once O
again O
we O
regained O
our O
elixir O
of O
life O
; O
optimism O
, O
the O
joyful O
expectancy O
of O
the O
coming O
liberation O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Terezin B-GHETTO
, O
we O
heard O
that O
my O
mother O
had O
arrived O
well O
3 O
days O
ago O
. O

At O
the O
station O
men O
and O
women O
were O
really O
separated O
. O

The O
head O
doctor O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
recognized O
me O
and O
had O
Erna B-PERS
, O
considering O
her O
condition O
, O
transferred O
to O
the O
women O
’ O
s O
barracks O
immediately O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
she O
was O
spared O
the O
three O
- O
day O
stay O
in O
the O
schleuse O
. O

Before O
being O
admitted O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
the O
new O
arrivals O
had O
to O
be O
channeled O
through O
the O
schleuse O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
quarantine O
, O
but O
it O
was O
mainly O
used O
to O
search O
and O
confiscate O
luggage O
. O

Medication O
, O
tools O
, O
instruments O
, O
tobacco O
products O
, O
canned O
goods O
, O
food O
, O
batteries O
, O
candles O
, O
lighters O
and O
much O
more O
were O
channeled O
. O

This O
expression O
was O
known O
to O
every O
ghetto O
inmate O
as O
a O
common O
word O
and O
was O
used O
to O
describe O
every O
kind O
of O
scam O
; O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
concepts O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

In O
this O
schleuse O
, O
hundreds O
of O
us O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
straw O
beneath O
us O
. O

An O
old O
friend O
from O
Brno B-LOC
was O
on O
duty O
with O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
and O
helped O
smuggle O
me O
into O
the O
women O
’ O
s O
barracks O
where O
Erna B-PERS
was O
staying O
on O
the O
first O
day O
. O

How O
happy O
I O
was O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O

My O
mother O
had O
just O
taken O
her O
in O
, O
prepared O
her O
a O
kind O
of O
bed O
and O
made O
her O
halfway O
comfortable O
. O

So O
it O
was O
not O
so O
bad O
even O
if O
the O
men O
slept O
, O
lived O
and O
were O
fed O
like O
pigs O
, O
women O
had O
it O
better O
and O
above O
all O
, O
they O
stayed O
within O
our O
reach O
. O

We O
also O
see O
that O
our O
assumptions O
about O
the O
children O
were O
correct O
, O
and O
that O
the O
ghetto O
' O
s O
management O
took O
care O
of O
their O
schooling O
much O
as O
I O
did O
in O
the O
refugee O
camp O
before O
, O
and O
the O
war O
would O
not O
last O
long O
. O

We O
took O
courage O
and O
looked O
forward O
to O
the O
things O
that O
were O
to O
come O
. O

On O
4 B-DATE

1942 I-DATE
we O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
and O
on O
9 B-DATE

. I-DATE
our O
son O
was O
born O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
Dr O
. O

H. O
, O
the O
gynecologist O
who O
looked O
after O
Erna B-PERS
, O
told O
me O
that O
the O
contractions O
had O
begun O
and O
that O
the O
birth O
was O
to O
be O
expected O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
fought O
for O
a O
pass O
slip O
to O
enter O
the O
women O
’ O
s O
barracks O
for O
5 O
h. O
The O
gendarme O
who O
examined O
the O
slip O
at O
the O
gate O
asked O
, O
Ah O
, O
you're O
the O
one O
who O
got O
the O
boy O
? O
So O
I O
learned O
that O
it O
was O
all O
over O
and O
that O
we O
had O
a O
boy O
. O

He O
was O
born O
at O
1pm O
. O

I O
stormed O
into O
the O
delivery O
room O
, O
and O
found O
a O
very O
pale O
but O
overjoyed O
Erna B-PERS
lying O
in O
bed O
. O

She O
was O
bleeding O
so O
much O
that O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
see O
the O
child O
at O
first O
. O

The O
birth O
was O
easy O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
complication O
after O
birth O
, O
and O
she O
had O
to O
undergo O
surgery O
and O
nearly O
bled O
out O
. O

But O
now O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

Fine O
? O
He O
had O
been O
born O
in O
a O
barrack O
room O
, O
on O
a O
borrowed O
iron O
bed O
, O
and O
three O
hours O
later O
she O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
Ubication O
, O
as O
the O
living O
quarters O
were O
called O
there O
, O
together O
with O
12 O
number O
is O
unclear O
other O
women O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
were O
shortly O
before O
birth O
and O
others O
who O
were O
shortly O
before O
it O
. O

She O
could O
not O
get O
used O
to O
the O
environment O
, O
but O
she O
kept O
herself O
brave O
. O

Words O
cannot O
describe O
what O
kind O
of O
woman O
she O
was O
and O
what O
she O
managed O
. O

She O
carried O
out O
motherhood O
in O
an O
exemplary O
fashion O
, O
as O
she O
did O
everything O
she O
put O
her O
hand O
to O
. O

She O
had O
to O
lie O
in O
bed O
for O
three O
weeks O
until O
she O
was O
well O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
up O
. O

She O
insisted O
on O
nursing O
the O
child O
, O
she O
looked O
after O
it O
like O
no O
other O
child O
was O
cared O
for O
. O

She O
was O
the O
model O
mother O
, O
the O
child O
the O
model O
child O
. O

We O
called O
him O
Michael B-PERS
Josef I-PERS
after O
Erna B-PERS
’ O
s O
brother O
, O
who O
had O
been O
murdered O
by O
the O
Nazis O
. O

He O
was O
the O
most O
beautiful O
child O
born O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
/ O
296 O
number O
is O
unclear O
children O
were O
born O
there O
all O
together/. O
My O
sister O
and O
mother O
helped O
Erna B-PERS
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
hard O
. O

Constantly O
new O
and O
newer O
obstacles O
had O
to O
be O
overcome O
before O
mother O
and O
child O
were O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
water O
had O
to O
be O
towed O
up O
2 O
floors O
, O
then O
coal O
, O
wood O
, O
an O
oven O
, O
a O
berth O
, O
cot O
and O
changing O
table O
, O
and O
a O
hundred O
other O
things O
that O
had O
to O
be O
procured O
first O
. O

Whether O
it O
was O
smuggled O
or O
newly O
- O
made O
, O
it O
was O
paid O
for O
with O
food O
that O
was O
already O
so O
limited O
. O

We O
got O
to O
eat O
: O
330 O
g O
bread O
, O
black O
coffee O
, O
2 O
watery O
soups O
, O
300 O
g O
potatoes O
with O
some O
sauce O
or O
vegetables O
. O

Workers O
got O
a O
little O
more O
bread O
and O
some O
margarine O
. O

But O
we O
still O
had O
some O
supplies O
from O
home O
, O
and O
I O
started O
working O
as O
a O
doctor O
and O
was O
soon O
able O
to O
earn O
so O
much O
that O
I O
could O
do O
it O
. O

But O
it O
was O
all O
only O
because O
Erna B-PERS
toiled O
tirelessly O
, O
she O
resisted O
the O
food O
and O
it O
was O
no O
wonder O
that O
she O
became O
quite O
run O
- O
down O
, O
as O
she O
did O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
a O
word O
about O
rest O
and O
recovery O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
soon O
became O
apparent O
that O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
not O
our O
final O
stop O
. O

As O
transports O
arrived O
- O
and O
there O
were O
2 O
- O
3 O
per O
week- O
equally O
strong O
ones O
were O
sent O
away O
again O
, O
to O
the O
east O
. O

Back O
illegible O
could O
only O
be O
seriously O
ill O
and O
people O
illegible O
has O
friends O
. O

Even O
families O
with O
small O
children O
were O
protected O
. O

So O
we O
had O
nothing O
to O
fear O
and O
also O
because O
I O
worked O
as O
a O
doctor O
, O
we O
were O
not O
sent O
on O
a O
transport O
. O

But O
on O
April B-DATE
28 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1942 I-DATE
my O
sister O
and O
her O
husband O
were O
to O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
East O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
possible O
to O
get O
her O
out O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
want O
to O
. O

She O
suffered O
so O
much O
from O
the O
separation O
from O
her O
husband O
; O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
see O
each O
other O
, O
since O
men O
and O
women O
lived O
and O
worked O
in O
strict O
separation O
, O
so O
she O
wanted O
to O
leave O
, O
hoping O
they O
would O
be O
together O
at O
their O
new O
destination O
. O

My O
sister O
wrote O
3 O
cards O
from O
the O
Lublin B-CAMP
area O
. O

She O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
husband O
since O
the O
ride O
. O

Then O
both O
were O
lost O
. O

But O
life O
went O
on O
. O

We O
found O
solace O
in O
our O
child O
, O
which O
worried O
us O
a O
lot O
and O
yet O
thrived O
. O

Jews O
from O
all O
over O
Europe B-LOC
wallowed O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
were O
processed O
, O
sifted O
and O
sent O
on O
. O

Young O
people O
were O
not O
sent O
via O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
but O
were O
sent O
directly O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
Munich B-LOC
and O
other O
cities O
to O
Poland B-LOC
to O
their O
ruin O
. O

Only O
people O
over O
65 O
years O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
to O
die O
here O
, O
or O
to O
fall O
victim O
to O
a O
transport O
to O
the O
east O
. O

In O
the O
hot O
summer O
months O
, O
a O
Ruhr O
epidemic O
broke O
out O
, O
hundreds O
died O
daily O
in O
the O
fully O
stuffed O
barracks O
, O
and O
the O
bodies O
could O
not O
be O
taken O
away O
in O
time O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
. O

A O
crematorium O
was O
built O
because O
the O
gravediggers O
could O
not O
keep O
up O
. O

The O
epidemic O
also O
spread O
to O
the O
infants O
' O
home O
and O
nearly O
half O
of O
all O
children O
died O
. O

Erna B-PERS
contracted O
measles O
in O
July B-DATE
. O

This O
disease O
is O
serious O
and O
very O
dangerous O
for O
adults O
. O

She O
was O
in O
great O
danger O
and O
infected O
the O
child O
with O
it O
. O

For O
48 O
hours O
it O
looked O
like O
both O
were O
lost O
. O

First O
, O
the O
mother O
recovered O
, O
but O
then O
the O
child O
got O
the O
feared O
diarrhea O

Three O
anxious O
days O
and O
just O
as O
many O
endless O
nights O
we O
fought O
for O
his O
life O

And O
he O
got O
well O

What O
did O
we O
want O
more O
? O
We O
got O
our O
child O
back O
twice O
. O

Everything O
else O
was O
end O
of O
the O
line O
is O
missing O
... O
another O
happy O
surprise O
came O
. O

On O
the O
6th B-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
a O
transport O
arrived O
bearing O
the O
quiet O
, O
modest O
and O
very O
skinny O
Mother O
Knoll B-PERS
. O

Can O
you O
imagine O
how O
happy O
mother O
and O
daughter O
were O
in O
all O
this O
end O
of O
the O
line O
is O
missing O
when O
they O
found O
each O
other O
. O

Of O
Bronja B-PERS
and O
her O
children O
, O
end O
of O
the O
line O
is O
missing O
reported O
they O
were O
sent O
directly O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

At O
that O
time O
we O
knew O
that O
Poland B-LOC
meant O
certain O
death O
, O
and O
always O
hoped O
for O
end O
of O
the O
line O
is O
missing O
. O

And O
on O
a O
final O
happy O
reunion O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
improved O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
only O
a O
few O
old O
barracks O
were O
accessible O
to O
the O
Jews O
and O
habitable O
, O
the O
whole O
city O
was O
later O
settled O
by O
Jews O
after O
the O
Aryan O
population O
had O
been O
forcibly O
evacuated O
. O

With O
this O
, O
the O
ban O
on O
leaving O
the O
house O
also O
fell O
. O

And O
we O
were O
able O
to O
move O
freely O
in O
the O
city O
, O
so O
we O
could O
visit O
our O
families O
and O
do O
that O
when O
we O
wanted O
. O

The O
children O
were O
allowed O
in O
the O
gardens O
and O
although O
the O
food O
was O
so O
short O
that O
you O
could O
starve O
to O
death O
, O
there O
were O
ways O
and O
means O
to O
improve O
it O
. O

Old O
, O
single O
people O
were O
lost O
, O
sooner O
or O
later O
they O
died O
of O
hunger O
and O
exhaustion O
. O

But O
where O
there O
was O
a O
young O
person O
in O
the O
family O
, O
they O
could O
create O
and O
improve O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
, O
be O
it O
better O
sleeping O
places O
, O
clothes O
or O
even O
more O
food O
. O

I O
had O
a O
wife O
and O
child O
, O
mother O
and O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
and O
two O
aunts O
to O
provide O
for O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
worked O
out O
. O

The O
child O
soon O
became O
the O
center O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
, O
our O
hope O
, O
our O
pride O
. O

Mother O
, O
grandmother O
, O
aunts O
but O
also O
patients O
vied O
to O
give O
him O
everything O
he O
needed O
. O

So O
it O
went O
on O
halfway O
and O
it O
seemed O
once O
again O
that O
the O
worst O
was O
over O
. O

Then O
Erna B-PERS
began O
to O
ache O
. O

The O
heavy O
blood O
loss O
at O
birth O
, O
later O
the O
hard O
physical O
work O
without O
proper O
nutrition O
, O
and O
later O
the O
severe O
barrack O
fever O
, O
she O
went O
downhill O
rapidly O
. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
long O
time O
since O
she O
had O
had O
the O
thriving O
appearance O
of O
pregnancy O
. O

She O
began O
to O
cough O
and O
one O
day O
it O
was O
clear O
: O
she O
had O
something O
on O
her O
lung O
. O

That O
was O
nearly O
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
could O
happen O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Not O
only O
that O
it O
lacked O
all O
the O
preconditions O
for O
healing O
, O
namely O
good O
air O
, O
plenty O
of O
food O
and O
rest O
, O
but O
above O
all O
, O
she O
immediately O
had O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
the O
child O
so O
as O
not O
to O
endanger O
it O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
what O
it O
means O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
the O
child O
as O
a O
young O
mother O
in O
such O
circumstances O
? O
I O
thought O
she O
could O
not O
stand O
it O
emotionally O
. O

It O
took O
weeks O
of O
convincing O
her O
that O
she O
needed O
to O
get O
well O
until O
she O
had O
the O
will O
to O
get O
well O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
long O
story O
to O
tell O
how O
a O
lounge O
chair O
was O
acquired O
, O
how O
the O
fight O
for O
food O
began O
, O
how O
we O
all O
hungered O
for O
many O
a O
day O
to O
exchange O
what O
was O
necessary O
for O
her O
and O
her O
child O
. O

It O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
get O
them O
to O
eat O
as O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
take O
anything O
we O
had O
saved O
ourselves O
. O

We O
had O
to O
lie O
the O
blue O
out O
of O
the O
sky O
, O
assuring O
her O
how O
much O
we O
had O
to O
eat O
, O
and O
that O
nobody O
would O
come O
up O
short O
due O
to O
the O
rations O
we O
had O
saved O
for O
them O
. O

She O
got O
eggs O
, O
butter O
, O
fruit O
, O
things O
that O
were O
otherwise O
known O
only O
through O
hearsay O
. O

She O
began O
to O
recover O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
our O
condition O
continued O
to O
improve O
as O
postal O
mail O
was O
allowed O
, O
and O
even O
parcels O
could O
be O
sent O
. O

Our O
Czech B-LOC
friends O
risked O
great O
danger O
( O
because O
it O
was O
dangerous O
to O
help O
Jews O
) O
to O
send O
us O
nice O
food O
parcels O
. O

Month O
after O
month O
passed O
, O
critical O
, O
anxious O
weeks O
. O

But O
Erna B-PERS
was O
soon O
out O
of O
danger O
and O
the O
miracle O
happened O
: O
she O
got O
well O
again O
. O

Again O
she O
got O
color O
in O
her O
face O
, O
again O
she O
became O
rounded O
and O
cheerful O
. O

Her O
lung O
problem O
disappeared O
almost O
completely O
and O
with O
her O
recovery O
we O
spoke O
again O
of O
our O
beautiful O
future O
, O
that O
soon O
finally O
the O
miserable O
war O
would O
be O
over O
, O
how O
long O
could O
it O
last O
? O
The O
child O
did O
surprisingly O
well O
. O

The O
sisters O
to O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
entrusted O
loved O
him O
and O
cared O
for O
him O
above O
themselves O
. O

I O
know O
, O
parents O
are O
not O
objective O
about O
their O
children O
, O
but O
our O
Mischa B-PERS
was O
a O
particularly O
well O
- O
done O
example O
of O
a O
human O
. O

He O
was O
a O
very O
beautiful O
child O
. O

Small O
and O
squat O
in O
stature O
, O
he O
resembled O
his O
mother O
otherwise O
; O
he O
had O
her O
olive O
skin O
color O
and O
her O
big O
, O
bright O
eyes O
, O
a O
tiny O
barely O
visible O
nose O
and O
pearl O
- O
white O
teeth O
. O

He O
soon O
started O
to O
walk O
and O
talk O
, O
of O
course O
only O
in O
Czech B-LOC
. O

His O
mother O
diligently O
learned O
this O
difficult O
language O
with O
him O
because O
she O
knew O
she O
would O
need O
it O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Mother O
and O
child O
were O
such O
a O
pleasing O
sight O
and O
a O
well O
- O
known O
phenomenon O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Unforgettable O
was O
my O
34th O
birthday O
, O
when O
both O
dressed O
in O
white O
, O
each O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
flowers O
in O
hand O
, O
they O
picked O
me O
up O
from O
work O
and O
congratulated O
me O
; O
how O
outraged O
my O
son O
was O
when O
I O
did O
not O
immediately O
give O
the O
flowers O
he O
had O
presented O
to O
me O
back O
to O
him O
. O

Mischa B-PERS
was O
the O
declared O
darling O
of O
all O
, O
with O
everything O
a O
child O
needs O
. O

He O
was O
dressed O
like O
a O
prince O
and O
had O
a O
new O
suit O
almost O
every O
day O
; O
I O
do O
not O
think O
he O
would O
have O
been O
better O
nourished O
or O
equipped O
had O
we O
been O
free O
. O

He O
was O
a O
very O
good O
child O
and O
often O
reminded O
us O
of O
Norberti O
when O
he O
was O
little O
. O

He O
hardly O
ever O
cried O
, O
even O
if O
he O
was O
ill O
. O

He O
liked O
to O
share O
his O
toys O
with O
others O
, O
which O
is O
rare O
with O
children O
. O

He O
loved O
his O
grandmothers O
above O
all O
else O
. O

He O
was O
happy O
when O
he O
could O
make O
those O
around O
him O
laugh O
and O
displayed O
considerable O
acting O
talent O
. O

We O
worried O
about O
him O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
made O
up O
for O
by O
the O
untold O
happiness O
that O
he O
brought O
to O
those O
around O
him O
. O

Months O
passed O
, O
and O
each O
day O
the O
much O
- O
anticipated O
liberation O
came O
one O
step O
closer O
. O

The O
ghetto O
was O
improved O
and O
embellished O
. O

It O
became O
a O
figurehead O
, O
a O
model O
ghetto O
. O

They O
were O
expecting O
an O
International B-ORG
Commission I-ORG
and O
they O
wanted O
to O
show O
how O
well O
the O
Jews O
were O
doing O
. O

Parks O
were O
created O
, O
children O
’s O
homes O
with O
playgrounds O
and O
paddling O
pools O
, O
shower O
baths O
, O
open O
- O
air O
concerts O
with O
parades O
, O
theater O
, O
concerts O
, O
and O
a O
coffee O
house O
were O
built O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
. O

Although O
the O
purpose O
was O
clear O
, O
we O
became O
beneficiaries O
. O

In O
Terezin B-GHETTO
, O
the O
best O
artists O
in O
Europe B-LOC
were O
interned O
, O
so O
the O
performances O
were O
at O
a O
very O
high O
level O
. O

We O
heard O
concerts O
that O
cannot O
soon O
be O
forgotten O
. O

Two O
football O
fields O
on O
which O
championships O
were O
fought O
emerged O
. O

Sport O
events O
were O
also O
celebrated O
, O
e.g O
. O

at O
Lag O
Baomer O
. O

The O
commission B-ORG
came O
, O
viewed O
everything O
with O
indulgent O
smiles O
, O
and O
let O
themselves O
be O
fooled O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
gone O
, O
the O
magic O
collapsed O
. O

Again O
it O
was O
announced O
: O
transports O
. O

Whenever O
we O
forgot O
for O
a O
few O
days O
that O
we O
were O
interned O
in O
a O
concentration O
camp O
, O
the O
word O
transport O
was O
spoken O
, O
and O
with O
one O
blow O
everything O
changed O
. O

Terrified O
, O
people O
slunk O
through O
the O
streets O
, O
whispering O
groups O
stood O
together O
, O
hunched O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
list O
to O
be O
announced O
, O
the O
same O
picture O
again O
and O
again O
: O
fear O
, O
terror O
, O
Are O
you O
in O
there O
? O
No O
, O
I'm O
not O
in O
it O
, O
I'm O
protected O
, O
but O
my O
mother O
is O
in O
! O
Have O
you O
already O
appealed O
? O
Yes O
, O
but O
it O
is O
hopeless O
. O

The O
same O
topic O
of O
conversation O
, O
the O
same O
haste O
, O
the O
same O
agitation O
everywhere O
. O

Rushing O
to O
pack O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
list O
is O
posted O
you O
can O
see O
again O
the O
oh O
so O
familiar O
picture O
. O

Heavily O
packed O
figures O
, O
numbered O
tablets O
around O
their O
necks O
, O
wander O
towards O
the O
schleuse O
, O
a O
barracks O
that O
had O
to O
house O
the O
unfortunate O
victims O
who O
had O
lost O
their O
lives O
in O
the O
unknown O
and O
had O
to O
drive O
away O
towards O
certain O
death O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
everyone O
was O
gathered O
there O
, O
the O
gates O
closed O
, O
and O
they O
no O
longer O
belonged O
to O
us O
: O
they O
were O
the O
foreign O
body O
that O
was O
to O
be O
expelled O
, O
but O
first O
had O
to O
be O
put O
to O
the O
side O
, O
demarcated O
, O
separated O
. O

Then O
they O
are O
loaded O
in O
wagons O
, O
the O
wagons O
are O
sealed O
and O
the O
transport O
is O
gone O
. O

And O
now O
the O
miracle O
happens O
. O

Everything O
breathes O
relief O
, O
what O
's O
gone O
is O
gone O
. O

Probably O
a O
girl O
is O
crying O
here O
, O
who O
had O
to O
let O
her O
parents O
go O
, O
there O
a O
little O
mother O
, O
whose O
son O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

But O
life O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
continues O
, O
this O
time O
it O
is O
still O
good O
. O

When O
, O
for O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
is O
the O
next O
transport O
? O
Oh O
well O
, O
until O
let O
the O
Soff O
end O
be O
, O
every O
day O
is O
life O
won O
. O

But O
after O
three O
months O
there O
were O
always O
1 O
- O
2 O
more O
transports O
and O
always O
the O
same O
, O
cruel O
game O
. O

200,000 O
people O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
30,000 O
now O
lived O
there O
, O
all O
the O
others O
left O
with O
transports O
. O

Eight O
times O
my O
mother O
was O
put O
on O
the O
list O
, O
eight O
times O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
her O
out O
thanks O
to O
my O
position O
and O
my O
connections O
. O

On O
13 B-DATE
. I-DATE
12 I-DATE
. I-DATE
1943 I-DATE
she O
and O
Mother O
Knoll B-PERS
were O
put O
on O
a O
transport O
. O

This O
time O
all O
my O
efforts O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

Did O
misery O
never O
end O
? O
I O
gave O
her O
injections O
to O
create O
an O
artificial O
fever O
and O
make O
her O
unable O
to O
transport O
. O

To O
no O
end O
. O

She O
had O
to O
go O
. O

She O
behaved O
heroically O
; O
she O
would O
have O
left O
happy O
and O
courageous O
, O
but O
saying O
farewell O
to O
the O
child O
was O
very O
difficult O
. O

On O
the O
last O
night O
, O
which O
I O
spent O
with O
her O
at O
the O
schleuse O
, O
she O
confessed O
that O
the O
months O
she O
had O
spent O
with O
us O
and O
her O
darling O
Misha B-PERS
, O
despite O
all O
the O
misery O
of O
deportation O
, O
were O
some O
of O
the O
happiest O
of O
her O
life O
. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
what O
awaited O
them O
, O
but O
we O
hoped O
that O
they O
would O
last O
the O
short O
time O
until O
our O
liberation O
, O
in O
hopes O
of O
a O
reunion O
. O

We O
did O
not O
see O
them O
again O
. O

The O
transport O
went O
to O
Birkenau B-CAMP
Auschwitz I-CAMP
. O

We O
smuggled O
secret O
letters O
out O
and O
asked O
for O
food O
parcels O
for O
both O
mothers O
. O

Over O
30 O
packages O
were O
sent O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
receive O
one O
. O

They O
died O
of O
hunger O
shortly O
after O
their O
arrival O
. O

How O
we O
missed O
our O
mothers O
! O
Our O
life O
normalized O
a O
bit O
. O

We O
were O
actually O
doing O
better O
and O
better O
. O

What O
had O
thus O
far O
gone O
towards O
our O
mothers O
now O
benefited O
the O
child O
and O
Erna B-PERS
. O

We O
got O
valuable O
packages O
and O
most O
of O
all O
, O
we O
got O
secret O
and O
dangerous O
newspapers O
and O
reports O
from O
outside O
. O

And O
we O
knew O
it O
was O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

The O
front O
approached O
from O
the O
east O
, O
the O
invasion O
succeeded O
. O

We O
expected O
the O
collapse O
daily O
. O

I O
had O
converted O
a O
horse O
stable O
into O
a O
small O
single O
room O
, O
which O
we O
had O
for O
ourselves O
. O

What O
happy O
hours O
the O
three O
of O
us O
spent O
there O
. O

The O
future O
shone O
bright O
before O
us O
in O
beautiful O
colors O
, O
we O
loved O
to O
talk O
about O
our O
loved O
ones O
all O
over O
the O
world O
, O
how O
we O
would O
see O
them O
again O
and O
how O
proud O
we O
would O
be O
to O
show O
them O
our O
pride O
. O

Everything O
seemed O
to O
be O
correct O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
hurt O
that O
sisters O
, O
brothers O
and O
now O
also O
our O
mothers O
were O
separated O
from O
us O
; O
that O
they O
no O
longer O
lived O
, O
we O
did O
not O
think O
about O
that O
. O

Only O
the O
end O
came O
so O
slowly O
, O
so O
slowly O
, O
too O
slowly O
. O

When O
we O
no O
longer O
thought O
about O
this O
possibility O
, O
the O
disaster O
came O
. O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1944 B-DATE
came O
the O
order O
: O
5,000 O
young O
men O
must O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
Reich O
, O
so O
again O
there O
would O
be O
transports O
. O

Overall O
, O
there O
were O
only O
about O
5,400 O
men O
, O
so O
practically O
everyone O
had O
to O
leave O
. O

But O
soon O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
this O
time O
it O
was O
something O
that O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
had O
not O
seen O
yet O
. O

At O
intervals O
of O
3 O
days O
, O
transport O
after O
transport O
, O
at O
first O
only O
men O
, O
then O
their O
wives O
and O
children O
, O
later O
, O
indiscriminately O
, O
everyone O
under O
65 O
years O
. O

I O
got O
on O
the O
so O
- O
called O
blue O
protection O
list O
, O
a O
list O
of O
people O
who O
were O
indispensable O
and O
had O
to O
stay O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Again O
we O
let O
ourselves O
think O
, O
as O
in O
Eibenschütz B-LOC
, O
that O
we O
were O
safe O
. O

And O
after O
each O
transport O
that O
was O
dispatched O
, O
everyone O
hoped O
: O
that O
was O
the O
last O
. O

But O
there O
was O
no O
end O
, O
it O
was O
like O
an O
evacuation O
. O

No O
one O
knew O
where O
the O
transports O
went O
, O
what O
happened O
to O
those O
on O
them O
. O

We O
were O
so O
blinded O
, O
we O
really O
were O
not O
capable O
of O
any O
logical O
thought O
. O

That O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
thing O
, O
we O
knew O
, O
they O
talked O
about O
new O
ghettos O
, O
women O
’ O
s O
and O
children O
’ O
s O
camp O
near O
the O
place O
where O
the O
men O
were O
supposed O
to O
work O
. O

A O
guessing O
game O
, O
no O
one O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
all O
about O
. O

Only O
those O
highest O
up O
knew O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
and O
they O
were O
silent O
as O
a O
grave O
. O

Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
not O
recognizable O
. O

The O
crowded O
living O
rooms O
were O
emptying O
, O
everyone O
was O
packing O
, O
a O
mess O
of O
discarded O
and O
left O
behind O
things O
. O

this O

we O

The O

Erna B-PERS

I O

all O

No O

we O

not O

As O
prudent O
and O
efficient O
as O
ever O

Erna B-PERS

Misha B-PERS

92 O
people O
penned O
in O
a O
wagon O
together O
with O
all O
their O
luggage O
, O
without O
toilet O
facilities O
, O
almost O
without O
water O
, O
as O
we O
drove O
2 O
days O
and O
3 O
nights O
. O

At O
dawn O
on O
the O
22nd B-DATE
, O
we O
drove O
slowly O
to O
the O
ramp O
of O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
that O
sounded O
bad O
, O
that O
was O
known O
as O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
concentration O
camps O
. O

But O
how O
could O
we O
know O
what O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
really O
was O
? O
Words O
can O
never O
describe O
it O
, O
no O
, O
even O
the O
sickest O
imagination O
cannot O
conjure O
what O
happened O
there O
. O

To O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
: O
in O
the O
car O
, O
Polish B-LOC
Jewish O
in O
striped O
suits O
crept O
in O
at O
the O
doors O
and O
windows O
, O
shouting O
at O
us O
to O
get O
out O
and O
leave O
all O
our O
luggage O
behind O
. O

They O
made O
people O
take O
their O
wristwatches O
from O
their O
hands O
and O
beat O
them O
when O
they O
defended O
themselves O
. O

They O
began O
to O
rob O
and O
steal O
whatever O
they O
liked O
. O

We O
were O
stunned O
, O
stunned O
. O

Erna B-PERS
tried O
to O
speak O
Yiddish O
with O
them O
, O
they O
did O
not O
pay O
her O
any O
heed O
. O

Get O
out O
, O
they O
said O
, O
men O
here O
, O
women O
and O
children O
there O
. O

I O
said O
a O
quick O
goodbye O
to O
my O
wife O
and O
child O
and O
promised O
them O
to O
come O
to O
them O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
overcome O
all O
obstacles O
to O
get O
to O
Erna B-PERS
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
two O
years O
ago O
, O
why O
shouldn’t O
I O
be O
able O
to O
do O
the O
same O
here O
? O
Misha B-PERS
was O
in O
a O
very O
good O
mood O
, O
because O
he O
liked O
new O
things O
. O

Slowly O
, O
the O
columns O
moved O
forward O
. O

There O
were O
three O
senior O
SS O
officers O
, O
immobile O
waxy O
skulls O
, O
and O
later O
I O
learned O
that O
one O
of O
them O
was O
the O
infamous O
Dr O
. O

Mengele B-PERS
, O
lord O
of O
life O
and O
death O
for O
millions O
of O
people O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
I O
saw O
the O
cruel O
game O
that O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
at O
the O
time O
and O
would O
later O
see O
so O
often O
. O

As O
each O
stepped O
forward O
, O
he O
pointed O
either O
to O
the O
right O
or O
to O
the O
left O
. O

He O
directed O
the O
young O
, O
strong O
people O
to O
the O
right O
; O
the O
old O
, O
women O
with O
children O
, O
and O
the O
ill O
to O
the O
left O
. O

He O
sent O
me O
right O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
that O
women O
with O
children O
on O
the O
left O
, O
I O
slipped O
to O
the O
left O
behind O
his O
back O
. O

An O
SS O
guard O
saw O
this O
and O
chased O
me O
back O
to O
Mengele B-PERS
. O

Herr O
Obersturmfuhrer O
, O
I O
am O
a O
doctor O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
go O
with O
the O
children O
and O
the O
ill O
. O

A O
scrutinizing O
look O
measures O
me O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
, O
then O
sends O
me O
to O
the O
right O
again O
. O

Once O
again O
I O
saw O
my O
wife O
, O
her O
exuberantly O
hopping O
son O
holding O
her O
hand O
, O
in O
the O
column O
of O
women O
with O
children O
, O
then O
they O
vanished O
from O
my O
sight O
. O

If O
only O
he O
had O
let O
me O
go O
with O
them O
! O
I O
would O
have O
been O
led O
with O
a O
thousand O
others O
, O
like O
millions O
before O
and O
after O
in O
the O
shower O
bath O
. O

There O
, O
inscriptions O
in O
all O
the O
languages O
​​of O
Europe B-LOC
stated O
that O
one O
should O
remember O
the O
number O
where O
their O
clothes O
were O
hung O
, O
so O
that O
they O
would O
not O
be O
confused O
. O

Undressed O
, O
everyone O
got O
a O
piece O
of O
soap O
and O
a O
paper O
towel O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
were O
then O
admitted O
into O
the O
bathroom O
. O

A O
huge O
room O
with O
showers O
hanging O
from O
the O
ceiling O
. O

Only O
it O
was O
noticeable O
that O
1500 O
people O
were O
being O
stuffed O
in O
, O
tightly O
packed O
. O

The O
showers O
were O
not O
showers O
, O
they O
just O
looked O
like O
them O
, O
decoys O
. O

Behind O
the O
last O
bather O
the O
doors O
closed O
hermetically O
and O
a O
German O
hero O
was O
provided O
with O
a O
gas O
mask O
, O
throwing O
cyanide O
bombs O
through O
a O
shaft O
into O
the O
room O
. O

He O
watched O
the O
success O
through O
a O
little O
window O
. O

If O
he O
had O
used O
enough O
gas O
, O
it O
took O
13 O
minutes O
until O
the O
last O
scream O
fell O
silent O
, O
but O
sometimes O
they O
skimped O
, O
then O
it O
took O
half O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
. O

How O
were O
the O
cries O
? O
I O
hope O
they O
did O
not O
know O
where O
they O
were O
going O
. O

I O
saw O
her O
constantly O
in O
front O
of O
me O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
naked O
, O
the O
child O
on O
her O
arm O
, O
calm O
, O
superior O
, O
angelic O
, O
in O
the O
sanctity O
of O
her O
motherhood O
, O
in O
the O
jostling O
crowd O
of O
naked O
bodies O
. O

I O
see O
her O
in O
front O
of O
me O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
the O
offense O
, O
as O
she O
tries O
to O
protect O
the O
child O
, O
tries O
to O
protect O
herself O
, O
I O
see O
her O
then O
united O
in O
death O
, O
the O
mother O
of O
my O
son O
and O
my O
son O
, O
and O
I O
am O
deeply O
sad O
that O
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
lie O
there O
with O
them O
, O
and O
that O
I O
am O
not O
with O
them O
now O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
them O
next O
was O
terrible O
. O

On O
massive O
[ O
cranes O
] O
, O
the O
corpses O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
crematorium O
, O
and O
each O
was O
examined O
by O
one O
of O
the O
50 O
dentists O
who O
worked O
there O
day O
and O
night O
ripping O
out O
gold O
teeth O
. O

Then O
into O
the O
oven O
with O
it O
. O

First O
the O
children O
, O
they O
burn O
best O
, O
then O
women O
, O
men O
last O
. O

It O
could O
be O
even O
worse O
. O

There O
were O
a O
to- O
tal O
of O
six O
crematoria O
in O
operation O
. O

Not O
all O
were O
so O
humanely O
equipped O
. O

If O
there O
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O
rush O
, O
or O
there O
was O
no O
gas O
, O
they O
did O
not O
[ O
wait O
long O
] O
. O

There O
were O
several O
ways O
to O
kill O
people O
, O
from O
the O
ax O
to O
an O
execution O
- O
style O
shot O
with O
a O
small O
pistol O
, O
to O
save O
on O
the O
usual O
shooting O
. O

Little O
children O
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
fire O
alive O
. O

The O
roar O
of O
the O
victims O
of O
Crematorium O
VI O
was O
audible O
throughout O
the O
camp O
for O
hours O
. O

This O
Crematorium O
VI O
was O
very O
primitive O
and O
only O
used O
in O
emergencies O
, O
not O
out O
of O
sentimentality O
, O
but O
to O
save O
trouble O
. O

The O
victims O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
know O
what O
was O
happening O
to O
them O
because O
otherwise O
they O
might O
defend O
themselves O
in O
their O
final O
despair O
. O

Crematorium O
VI O
looked O
like O
a O
farmhouse O
, O
nestled O
in O
a O
grove O
, O
surrounded O
by O
an O
opaque O
wooden O
fence O
. O

Near O
the O
house O
was O
a O
big O
pit O
, O
with O
straw O
in O
it O
, O
which O
was O
showered O
with O
gasoline O
. O

The O
slain O
ones O
were O
burned O
under O
the O
open O
sky O
here O
. O

Only O
after O
revolts O
and O
other O
unpleasant O
incidents O
had O
the O
machine O
been O
rationalized O
and O
brought O
to O
a O
more O
humane O
level O
. O

All O
of O
this O
is O
true O
, O
not O
the O
offspring O
of O
morbid O
fantasies O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
know O
all O
that O
then O
, O
I O
learned O
it O
only O
weeks O
after O
liberation O
. O

On O
the O
gray O
morning O
of O
our O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
we O
went O
to O
the O
right O
. O

1500 O
people O
, O
we O
had O
been O
loaded O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
; O
160 O
men O
and O
40/60 O
The O
number O
is O
illegible O
. O

women O
went O
to O
the O
right O
. O

We O
too O
came O
to O
a O
bath O
after O
an O
hour O
's O
march O
. O

But O
even O
the O
way O
there O
taught O
us O
that O
we O
were O
in O
another O
world O
. O

Right O
and O
left O
stood O
a O
double O
4 O
m O
high O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
with O
large O
inscriptions O
reading O
: O
Attention O
: O
high O
voltage O
, O
do O
not O
touch O
. O

Flanked O
by O
SS O
guards O
with O
machine O
pistols O
at O
the O
ready O
. O

To O
the O
left O
and O
right O
behind O
the O
fences O
, O
infinitely O
long O
and O
infinitely O
barren O
rows O
of O
barracks O
. O

Their O
inmates O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
barracks O
while O
we O
were O
marching O
through O
, O
nobody O
was O
allowed O
to O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

From O
a O
block O
of O
women O
, O
a O
young O
woman O
shouted O
over O
to O
us O
to O
throw O
some O
food O
over O
the O
fence O
. O

A O
preserve O
, O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread O
flew O
over O
. O

There O
's O
a O
shot O
and O
the O
woman O
lies O
dead O
in O
her O
blood O
. O

Onward O
. O

Seems O
to O
be O
an O
everyday O
affair O
, O
because O
nobody O
behind O
the O
fence O
gets O
upset O
about O
it O
. O

I'm O
trying O
to O
start O
up O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
guard O
whistling O
beside O
me O
. O

He O
is O
not O
unfriendly O
and O
answers O
my O
question O
about O
how O
it O
is O
for O
children O
here O
: O
With O
the O
children O
, O
yes O
, O
that O
was O
bad O
so O
far O
. O

But O
now O
it O
is O
better O
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
group O
homes O
, O
the O
mothers O
live O
with O
them O
and O
go O
to O
work O
during O
the O
day O
. O

They O
have O
their O
own O
food O
and O
are O
cared O
for O
by O
older O
women O
when O
the O
mothers O
are O
working O
. O

This O
information O
calmed O
me O
to O
some O
extent O
and O
helped O
ease O
what O
came O
later O
. O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
linger O
on O
it O
long O
because O
what O
happened O
to O
me O
is O
not O
important O
. O

I O
kept O
going O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
see O
my O
child O
again O
. O

Whatever O
happened O
from O
that O
moment O
until O
our O
liberation O
, O
I O
always O
had O
the O
child O
in O
mind O
and O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
stay O
alive O
. O

It O
is O
completely O
inexplicable O
to O
me O
today O
that O
I O
remained O
alive O
. O

In O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
bath O
, O
called O
the O
Sauna O
, O
we O
were O
robbed O
under O
bouts O
and O
beatings O
, O
bellowing O
and O
ranting O
, O
of O
the O
last O
things O
we O
still O
had O
. O

First O
we O
had O
to O
deliver O
money O
and O
gold O
, O
as O
far O
as O
we O
still O
had O
any O
: O
wedding O
rings O
, O
watches O
, O
fountain O
pens O
. O

I O
crushed O
my O
watch O
and O
buried O
my O
fountain O
pen O
. O

We O
were O
subjected O
to O
a O
renewed O
selection O
, O
as O
the O
beautiful O
game O
was O
called O
, O
each O
new O
sorting O
out O
, O
which O
we O
had O
first O
experienced O
at O
the O
station O
with O
Dr O
. O

Mengele B-PERS
and O
where O
was O
decided O
who O
should O
die O
immediately O
and O
who O
should O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
labor O
camp O
to O
die O
there O
after O
long O
torment O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
keep O
our O
glasses O
, O
belts O
and O
loafers O
, O
we O
had O
to O
hand O
over O
everything O
else O
. O

They O
searched O
all O
our O
body O
cavities O
for O
hidden O
valuables O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
shaved O
all O
over O
our O
bodies O
, O
sent O
under O
a O
cold O
shower O
, O
and O
chased O
out O
into O
the O
open O
in O
icy O
cold O
weather O
. O

Teeth O
chattering O
, O
we O
waited O
naked O
, O
until O
we O
got O
our O
new O
[ O
clothes O
] O
. O

Filthy O
stinking O
striped O
prisoners O
suits O
, O
so O
- O
called O
pajamas O
, O
often O
stained O
with O
blood O
, O
presumably O
stripped O
from O
someone O
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
to O
death O
. O

Then O
the O
new O
numbers O
were O
tattooed O
in O
the O
forearm O
, O
signed O
for O
life O
. O

So O
far O
I O
had O
been O
called O
Ah B-PERS
712 I-PERS
, O
from O
now O
on O
simply O
119224 O
. O

No O
underclothes O
, O
no O
coat O
, O
no O
stockings O
. O

Very O
cold O
, O
we O
stared O
at O
each O
other O
and O
did O
not O
recognize O
each O
other O
. O

Not O
just O
that O
we O
were O
shorn O
and O
disguised O
, O
as O
at O
a O
masquerade O
ball O
, O
but O
a O
new O
look O
was O
there O
. O

Naked O
horror O
, O
coupled O
with O
fear O
, O
but O
also O
a O
determination O
to O
pay O
them O
back O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
with O
us O
. O

So O
that O
was O
the O
work O
in O
the O
Reich O
we O
were O
sent O
to O
? O
Many O
fell O
during O
the O
procedures O
and O
did O
not O
stand O
up O
, O
not O
even O
when O
the O
flailing O
dog O
whip O
painted O
bloody O
welts O
on O
their O
skin O
. O

Even O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bath O
building O
, O
we O
drilled O
the O
main O
command O
: O
hats O
off O
, O
hats O
on O
. O

Shouts O
, O
beatings O
, O
shots O
. O

Where O
is O
Mischa B-PERS
now O
? O
Does O
Erna B-PERS
have O
enough O
blankets O
? O
Did O
they O
already O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
? O
These O
worries O
constantly O
went O
through O
my O
head O
because O
they O
were O
now O
alone O
and O
without O
my O
help O
. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
actually O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
is O
already O
evening O
, O
we O
march O
into O
our O
barracks O
. O

I O
ask O
our O
Stubendienst O
, O
an O
older O
prisoner O
, O
what O
he O
knows O
about O
the O
children O
. O

What O
, O
your O
child O
? O
Look O
there O
, O
there O
you O
have O
your O
child O
! O
He O
points O
to O
a O
huge O
chimney O
, O
visible O
from O
everywhere O
in O
the O
camp O
. O

The O
grisly O
symbol O
of O
annihilation O
. O

Giant O
, O
black O
, O
towering O
into O
the O
evening O
sky O
, O
meters O
high O
flames O
rise O
from O
it O
, O
although O
it O
is O
already O
a O
good O
20 O
m O
high O
. O

Do O
you O
see O
how O
well O
your O
child O
is O
burning O
? O
You O
do O
not O
need O
to O
worry O
about O
your O
wife O
and O
child O
anymore O
. O

Mine O
went O
there O
half O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
as O
you O
can O
see O
, O
I O
am O
still O
alive O
. O

What O
does O
this O
man O
talk O
about O
? O
Has O
he O
gone O
mad O
? O
Or O
am O
I O
crazy O
? O
That O
's O
not O
possible O
, O
that O
's O
... O
I O
walk O
down O
the O
camp O
street O
in O
a O
daze O
, O
meet O
a O
loyal O
companion O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
who O
has O
already O
been O
here O
for O
3 O
The O
number O
is O
illegible O
. O

weeks O
. O

Completely O
disturbed O
, O
I O
tell O
him O
what O
I've O
just O
heard O
. O

He O
laughs O
at O
me O
, O
and O
says O
that O
it O
’s O
not O
true O
, O
or O
at O
least O
exaggerated O
. O

People O
do O
get O
gassed O
and O
burned O
, O
but O
only O
old O
people O
, O
cripples O
, O
disabled O
people O
. O

Children O
and O
women O
? O
What O
a O
thought O
! O
He O
himself O
had O
worked O
on O
an O
external O
commando O
near O
the O
FKL O
( O
women O
’s O
and O
children O
’ O
s O
camp O
) O
, O
he O
himself O
had O
seen O
how O
children O
played O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
older O
women O
there O
, O
their O
rooms O
clean O
, O
painted O
white O
. O

I O
should O
not O
let O
people O
scare O
me O
. O

People O
like O
to O
do O
that O
here O
. O

He O
had O
trouble O
calming O
and O
convincing O
me O
. O

But O
, O
what O
man O
wants O
to O
believe O
, O
he O
chooses O
to O
believe O
. O

Still O
, O
I O
felt O
the O
barb O
. O

The O
comrade O
brought O
in O
more O
eyewitnesses O
, O
who O
had O
to O
confirm O
to O
me O
that O
the O
children O
had O
looked O
well O
, O
that O
the O
women O
had O
been O
allowed O
to O
keep O
their O
clothes O
, O
they O
had O
not O
even O
been O
shaved O
bald O
. O

That O
was O
all O
similar O
to O
what O
the O
SS O
guard O
had O
told O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
renewed O
hope O
. O

And O
besides O
, O
even O
they O
were O
human O
beings O
, O
and O
it O
is O
quite O
impossible O
that O
people O
, O
even O
if O
they O
are O
SS O
, O
would O
murder O
innocent O
children O
. O

I O
did O
not O
miss O
any O
opportunity O
later O
to O
catch O
up O
on O
any O
information O
about O
what O
happened O
to O
women O
and O
children O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

Was O
it O
the O
wisdom O
of O
the O
informants O
or O
were O
they O
startled O
by O
my O
questioning O
eyes O
? O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
I O
collected O
statement O
after O
statement O
and O
became O
more O
and O
more O
convinced O
that O
they O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

How O
and O
where O
, O
the O
gods O
only O
knew O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
for O
four O
days O
. O

Hell O
cannot O
be O
worse O
. O

We O
got O
nothing O
to O
eat O
because O
our O
provisions O
were O
bartered O
away O
by O
our O
block O
elders O
for O
liquor O
and O
women O
. O

A O
shy O
protest O
attempt O
by O
an O
inmate O
ended O
with O
him O
being O
beaten O
half O
to O
death O
. O

He O
died O
shortly O
thereafter O

of O
the O

How O
could O
I O
stand O
this O
? O
Again O
and O
again O
the O
nagging O
question O
, O
did O
they O
really O
only O
burn O
cripples O
and O
old O
people O
? O
When O
had O
it O

my O

It O
was O

on O

fifth O

were O
recruited O
into O
a O
work O
transport O

Of O

Again O

picked O
out O

we O
hunted O

everything O
at O
a O
running O
pace O
, O
pushed O
, O
hunted O

Each O

grabs O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread O
, O
a O
slice O
of O
sausage O
, O
a O
piece O
of O

After O
four O
days O
of O
fasting O
, O
we O
jump O
on O

like O
wolves O

Trapped O
in O

we O

Then O
they O
said O

In O

We O

Why O

all O

We O

Today O

they O

accompanied O

the O
former O
head O
of O
the O

Dr O

Marzolla B-PERS
, O
and O
ordered O
several O
of O
the O
boxes O

opened O

and O
said O
that O
Dr O

Marzoll B-PERS
, O
who O
was O
an O
expert O
on O
musical O
instruments O
, O
would O
look O
at O
the O
instruments O

It O
was O
apparent O
that O
Marzoll B-PERS
was O
informed O
about O
which O
instruments O
belong O
to O
certain O
people O
. O

In O
Prostějov B-LOC
, O
even O
after O
the O
occupation O
, O
a O
private O

performed O
, O
in O
which O
Mizerovský B-PERS
, O
a O
clerk O
of O

Tax O

played O

He O
also O

the O
beautiful O

. O

that O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Prostějov B-LOC
Jewish O
quartet O
owned O
. O

During O
the O
review O
, O
when O
Marzoll B-PERS
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
Bankl B-PERS
, O
probably O
searched O
for O
these O
instruments O
for O
himself O
, O
it O
came O
to O
light O
that O
several O
people O
didn’t O
hand O
over O
these O
valuable O
instruments O
, O
but O
instead O
had O
handed O
over O
ordinary O
instruments O
. O

Bankl B-PERS
ordered O
the O
original O
instruments O
to O
be O
handed O
over O
within O
a O
week O
and O
promised O
that O
he O
would O
abandon O
the O
criminal O
prosecution O
in O
this O
case O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
this O
promise O
, O
he O
arrested O
a O
member O
of O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
quartet O
, O
Rudolf B-PERS
Weissbarth I-PERS
, O
the O
very O

another O

, O
Artur B-PERS
Auerbach I-PERS

as O
well O
. O

Weissbarth B-PERS

he O
committed O

and O
Auerbach B-PERS
died O
a O

later O
in O
the O

, O
also O
by O
hanging O
, O
according O
to O
the O
statement O
. O

Bankl B-PERS
caused O
the O
death O
of O
two O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
citizens O
. O

The O
accused O
, O
Hüntgens B-PERS
Paul O
Hündgen O
, O
sometimes O
came O
to O
Prostějov B-LOC
and O
interrogated O
Jews O
who O
were O
accused O
of O
various O
trumped O
up O
charges O
and O
arrested O
many O
Jewish O
citizens O

Out O
of O
these O
, O
a O
significant O
number O
was O
transported O

Thus O

, O
he O
was O

when O

had O
to O
hand O
over O
any O
eventual O
hidden O
valuable O
items O
, O
money O
, O
tobacco O
products O
, O
lighters O
under O
threat O
of O
very O
harsh O
punishments O
. O

These O
roll O
calls O
were O
led O
by O
the O
head O
of O
the O
circus O
, O
Robert B-PERS
Mandler I-PERS
, O
who O
treated O
us O
as O
if O
he O
were O
an O
SS O
man O
. O

The O
Jewish O
blood O
of O
this O
man O
was O
the O
only O
impediment O
to O
his O
becoming O
a O
member O
of O
the O
SS O
. O

He O
and O
his O
gang O
didn’t O
let O
that O
stop O
them O
from O
beating O
up O
Jews O
. O

When O
he O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
Mandler B-PERS
was O
so O
warmly O
received O
by O
the O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
Jews O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
with O
several O
broken O
ribs O
and O
other O
injuries O
. O

When O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
apartment O
, O
the O
ghetto O
leadership O
had O
to O
order O
the O
ghetto O
guards O
to O
stand O
guard O
in O
front O
of O
his O
apartment O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
several O
months O
later O
, O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
appointed O
this O
scoundrel O
chief O
of O
the O
criminal O
police O
. O

On O
September B-DATE
29th I-DATE
, O
we O
were O
loaded O
onto O
train O
cars O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
, O
all O
while O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
struck O
the O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
. O

We O
traveled O
in O
train O
cars O
for O
people O
. O

Right O
after O
we O
set O
off O
, O
somebody O
died O
. O

We O
traveled O
with O
the O
corpse O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

On O
September B-DATE
30 I-DATE
, O
all O
of O
us O
from O
Ostrava B-LOC
arrived O
on O
the O
third O
transport O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

At O
the O
train O
station O
in O
Bohušovice B-LOC
we O
were O
awaited O
by O
SS O
members O
and O
protectorate O
policemen O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
we O
saw O
when O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
train O
station O
was O
2,000 O
elderly O
people O
, O
who O
were O
being O
loaded O
into O
cattle O
cars O
and O
deported O
to O
the O
east O
. O

A O
devastating O
sight O
. O

The O
SS O
shouted O
at O
them O
and O
mercilessly O
beat O
the O
old O
people O
. O

The O
assistant O
to O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
ghetto O
, O
ing O
. O

Zucker B-PERS
Otta I-PERS
and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
central B-ORG
secretariat I-ORG
Dr O
. O

Janowitz B-PERS
were O
present O
at O
the O
train O
station O
. O

We O
had O
to O
board O
in O
rows O
of O
four O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
old O
and O
sick O
people O
were O
loaded O
into O
trucks O
and O
taken O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
but O
there O
weren’t O
enough O
vehicles O
for O
all O
of O
the O
old O
people O
and O
so O
many O
had O
to O
walk O
the O
4 O
km O
long O
road O
from O
Bohušovice B-LOC
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

The O
luggage O
remained O
at O
the O
train O
station O
and O
was O
taken O
during O
the O
day O
by O
the O
transportation O
section O
. O

Each O
of O
us O
had O
to O
carry O
their O
own O
hand O
luggage O
. O

At O
the O
train O
station O
, O
there O
were O
some O
so O
- O
called O
transport O
assistance O
girls O
there O
to O
help O
people O
carry O
their O
bags O
, O
but O
only O
a O
few O
of O
us O
used O
their O
help O
because O
we O
had O
been O
warned O
and O
told O
that O
not O
all O
the O
members O
of O
the O
transport O
team O
were O
reliable O
and O
honest O
. O

Unfortunately O
. O

We O
soon O
found O
out O
that O
this O
was O
true O
. O

We O
needed O
almost O
three O
hours O
to O
walk O
the O
4 O
km O
, O
because O
some O
people O
would O
collapse O
again O
and O
again O
and O
we O
needed O
to O
wait O
for O
them O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

During O
the O
march O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
not O
only O
SS O
members O
were O
present O
, O
but O
also O
protectorate O
policemen O
, O
who O
made O
sure O
we O
walked O
slowly O
and O
were O
respectful O
to O
those O
who O
were O
tired O
. O

They O
allowed O
us O
to O
take O
frequent O
breaks O
. O

We O
finally O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

The O
street O
that O
we O
walked O
down O
was O
completely O
devoid O
of O
people O
; O
it O
was O
deathly O
quiet O
. O

We O
later O
learned O
that O
people O
weren’t O
allowed O
to O
be O
out O
on O
the O
streets O
that O
the O
transports O
were O
walking O
on O
, O
or O
indeed O
even O
on O
the O
side O
streets O
, O
when O
the O
transports O
arrived O
and O
departed O
. O

They O
led O
us O
to O
the O
courtyard O
of O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
. O

We O
stood O
there O
and O
the O
so O
- O
called O
began O
, O
meaning O
that O
the O
policemen O
searched O
our O
luggage O
and O
pockets O
for O
contraband O
. O

They O
confiscated O
money O
, O
medicine O
, O
tobacco O
, O
lighters O
, O
matches O
, O
liquor O
, O
thermoses O
, O
pocket O
flashlights O
, O
and O
other O
items O
. O

When O
they O
took O
all O
of O
these O
things O
away O
from O
us O
, O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
attic O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

This O
room O
was O
requisitioned O
to O
house O
us O
. O

The O
attic O
, O
in O
which O
hundreds O
of O
people O
were O
already O
living O
, O
hadn’t O
been O
cleaned O
for O
years O
and O
so O
each O
movement O
no O
matter O
how O
slight O
released O
clouds O
of O
dust O
. O

There O
were O
no O
beds O
for O
sleeping O
and O
so O
we O
had O
no O
other O
option O
than O
to O
spread O
our O
blankets O
over O
the O
brick O
floor O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
a O
strict O
search O
, O
our O
larger O
luggage O
was O
returned O
to O
us O
. O

From O
many O
of O
the O
suitcases O
they O
confiscated O
not O
only O
contraband O
, O
but O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
and O
clothing O
. O

These O
things O
were O
stolen O
, O
or O
as O
they O
said O
, O
geschleusst O
, O
by O
the O
Jewish O
members O
of O
the O
transportation B-ORG
section I-ORG
. O

We O
were O
lucky O
that O
we O
got O
back O
not O
only O
our O
hand O
luggage O
, O
but O
also O
our O
larger O
suitcases O
, O
even O
though O
they O
were O
made O
lighter O
because O
many O
transports O
, O
especially O
those O
from O
Austria B-LOC
and O
from O
the O
Reich O
had O
their O
baggage O
confiscated O
by O
SS O
members O
when O
they O
arrived O
. O

The O
people O
on O
those O
transports O
had O
only O
what O
they O
wore O
when O
they O
arrived O
and O
it O
took O
several O
months O
before O
they O
got O
wholly O
unsuitable O
replacements O
of O
what O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
them O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Council O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
received O
permission O
to O
leave O
our O
dwelling O
place O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
to O
search O
for O
my O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
transported O
four O
days O
before O
me O
with O
other O
residents O
of O
the O
Jewish O
old O
people O
's O
home O
from O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
. O

In O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
residents O
of O
the O
old O
people O
's O
home O
would O
also O
be O
housed O
in O
the O
old O
people O
's O
home O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
which O
would O
apparently O
be O
set O
up O
as O
best O
as O
possible O
. O

I O
asked O
a O
member O
of O
the O
ghetto O
guard O
, O
where O
I O
could O
find O
the O
old O
people O
's O
home O
. O

The O
guard O
stared O
at O
me O
in O
surprise O
and O
told O
me O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
of O
the O
sort O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

In O
the O
central O
register O
, O
I O
finally O
found O
out O
my O
mother O
’ O
s O
address O
. O

She O
lived O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
dirty O
attic O
of O
a O
private O
building O
together O
with O
several O
hundred O
other O
old O
people O
, O
without O
any O
of O
her O
luggage O
, O
without O
blankets O
, O
without O
pillows O
. O

On O
Hauptscharführer O
Fiedler B-PERS
’ O
s O
order O
, O
everything O
was O
taken O
away O
still O
in O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
. O

Most O
of O
the O
old O
people O
lay O
on O
the O
dirty O
stone O
floor O
without O
straw O
mattresses O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
house O
if O
they O
could O
place O
my O
mother O
in O
a O
room O
, O
but O
he O
told O
me O
that O
there O
isn’t O
any O
free O
room O
anywhere O
in O
the O
entire O
house O
. O

When O
I O
gave O
him O
several O
cigarettes O
, O
not O
only O
was O
a O
space O
found O
, O
but O
a O
straw O
mattress O
as O
well O
. O

I O
then O
took O
a O
look O
around O
the O
house O
. O

In O
the O
rooms O
, O
closets O
, O
kitchens O
, O
and O
in O
the O
shop O
rooms O
, O
people O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
on O
straw O
mattresses O
, O
most O
without O
them O
. O

In O
this O
house O
, O
which O
had O
around O
28 O
rooms O
, O
there O
were O
X00 O
number O
unclear O
people O
. O

Similar O
conditions O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
other O
houses O
as O
well O
. O

I O
gradually O
found O
this O
out O
as O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
shelter O
for O
my O
family O
. O

I O
wandered O
from O
house O
to O
house O
, O
from O
one O
elder O
of O
the O
house O
to O
another O
, O
seeing O
the O
same O
thing O
everywhere O
: O
a O
house O
stuffed O
from O
the O
ground O
floor O
to O
the O
roof O
with O
people O
. O

Bed O
upon O
bed O
on O
the O
floors O
, O
the O
healthy O
lying O
close O
to O
the O
sick O
, O
the O
able O
to O
walk O
squeezed O
next O
to O
those O
who O
no O
longer O
could O
. O

There O
wasn’t O
any O
free O
space O
, O
any O
gaps O
, O
people O
had O
to O
crawl O
over O
one O
another O
when O
they O
needed O
to O
get O
from O
place O
to O
place O
. O

After O
a O
long O
search O
, O
when O
I’d O
almost O
given O
up O
all O
hope O
, O
I O
finally O
found O
by O
chance O
a O
small O
place O
for O
my O
people O
. O

A O
12 O
sq O
. O

m. O
walk O
- O
through O
room O
without O
a O
window O
for O
8 O
people O
. O

It O
was O
entered O
straight O
from O
the O
courtyard O
balcony O
, O
a O
room O
without O
a O
stove O
, O
without O
straw O
mattresses O
. O

About O
50 O
people O
from O
the O
next O
room O
constantly O
walked O
through O
the O
room O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
was O
happy O
that O
I O
had O
found O
this O
room O
. O

Several O
days O
later O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
scrounge O
up O
two O
straw O
mattresses O
for O
my O
parents O
, O
a O
priceless O
jewel O
in O
those O
days O
. O

The O
barracks O
where O
the O
men O
and O
women O
conscripted O
to O
forced O
labor O
were O
placed O
was O
full O
as O
well O
. O

In O
the O
Sudetenkaserne B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
400 O
men O
slept O
in O
each O
room O
on O
pallets O
with O
three O
bunks O
. O

Of O
the O
11 O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
barracks O
, O
six O
were O
used O
as O
housing O
. O

Three O
, O
the O
Dresden B-LOC

and O
Podmokly B-LOC
housed O
the O

, O
and O
the O
Hannover B-LOC
, O
Sudetenkaserne B-LOC
, O
and O
riding O
barracks O
housed O
the O
men O
. O

In O
all O
of O
the O
barracks O
, O
the O
beds O
had O
three O
bunks O
. O

This O
is O
how O
about O
50,000 O
Jews O
lived O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
1942 B-DATE
with O
the O
exception O
of O
children O
, O
who O
were O
better O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

We O
had O
high O
officials O
in O
two O
groups O
: O
A O
and O
B. O
The O
gestapo B-ORG
selected O
the O
high O
officials O
for O
group O
A O
, O
and O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
decided O
who O
would O
be O
the O
high O
officials O
for O
group O
B. O
The O
high O
officials O
of O
group O
A O
were O
mostly O
baptized O
Jews O
and O
people O
with O
high O
and O
significant O
positions O
, O
such O
as O
generals O
, O
high O
officers O
of O
the O
corps O
, O
university O
professors O
, O
theater O
actors O
, O
and O
people O
who O
did O
good O
deeds O
for O
Germany O
. O

This O
group O
of O
high O
officials O
contained O
primarily O
Jews O
from O
the O
Third O
Reich O
and O
Austria B-LOC
and O
only O
a O
few O
from O
other O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
that O
I O
can O
say O
that O
nobody O
from O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
was O
among O
them O
. O

The O
high O
officials O
in O
group O
B O
were O
people O
who O
contributed O
to O
the O
Jewish O
cause O
. O

High O
officials O
in O
group O
A O
and O
B O
were O
placed O
in O
special O
houses O
and O
each O
had O
their O
own O
room O
together O
with O
their O
wives O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
Jewish O
elder O
, O
his O
deputies O
, O
and O
council O
members O
had O
superior O
housing O
in O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
houses O
for O
high O
officials O
. O

These O
people O
lived O
two O
per O
room O
. O

Many O
other O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
ghetto O
received O
better O
places O
for O
themselves O
and O
their O
families O
for O
various O
reasons O
. O

Apartments O
were O
allocated O
by O
the O
division O
that O
was O
called O
Raumwirtschaft O
. O

It O
was O
led O
by O
Dr O
. O

Karel B-PERS
Löwinger I-PERS
, O
a O
lesser O
lawyer O
from O
Karlovy B-LOC
Vary I-LOC
whose O
motto O
was O
he O
who O
greases O
, O
gets O
it O
. O

As O
a O
careful O
lawyer O
, O
he O
got O
a O
third O
person O
to O
collect O
for O
him O
. O

For O
children O
and O
youths O
, O
special O
shelters O
were O
converted O
, O
which O
were O
organised O
by O
the O
Youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
department I-ORG
. O

This O
age O
group O
was O
indeed O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

Children O
lived O
in O
large O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
airy O
rooms O
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
kitchens O
, O
which O
cooked O
rather O
well O
and O
plentifully O
considering O
the O
circumstances O
. O

They O
also O
received O
the O
contents O
of O
care O
packages O
that O
could O
not O
be O
delivered O
to O
the O
addressee O
, O
and O
fruit O
, O
chocolate O
, O
condensed O
milk O
, O
etc O
. O

Living O
conditions O
improved O
during O
the O
year O
1943 B-DATE
primarily O
because O
of O
the O
transports O
but O
also O
because O
of O
the O
high O
number O
of O
deaths O
in O
the O
last O
months O
of O
1942 B-DATE
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
1943 B-DATE
. O

The O
number O
of O
Jews O
decreased O
from O
around O
60,000 O
to O
about O
40,000 O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
most O
homes O
, O
beds O
with O
three O
bunks O
just O
like O
those O
in O
the O
barracks O
were O
built O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
were O
14 O

20 O
people O

, O
Jews O
were O
housed O
only O
in O
the O
barracks O
, O
the O
men O
separately O
from O
the O
women O
. O

They O
could O
only O
leave O
the O
barracks O
when O
they O
went O
to O
work O
. O

Visits O
weren’t O
allowed O
. O

For O
months O
, O
couples O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
place O
without O
the O
opportunity O
of O
seeing O
one O
another O
. O

If O
there O
was O
men O
’ O
s O
work O
to O
be O
done O
in O
the O
women O
’ O

barracks O
, O
the O
men O
rushed O
to O
volunteer O
in O
order O
to O
see O
their O
wives O
at O
least O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
or O
to O
have O
a O
brief O
conversation O
. O

Often O
, O
however O
, O
they O
were O
watched O
so O
strictly O
that O
one O
couldn’t O
take O
two O
steps O
away O
from O
one O
’s O
place O
of O
work O
, O
and O
they O
had O
to O
return O
to O
the O
barracks O
after O
many O
hours O
of O
hard O
work O
without O
seeing O
their O
wives O
. O

In O
May B-DATE
and O
June B-DATE
, O
the O
civilian O
population O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
evacuated O
and O
the O
emptied O
houses O
were O
given O
over O
to O
the O
Jews O
to O
live O
in O
. O

Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
divided O
into O
4 O
districts O
, O
each O
led O
by O
an O
elder O
who O
reported O
to O
the O
internal O
administration O
. O

Each O
district O
elder O
was O
given O
a O
civil O
servant O
to O
sort O
out O
housing O
. O

Each O
house O
was O
subordinate O
to O
the O
elder O
of O
the O
house O
, O
who O
was O
responsible O
for O
all O
of O
the O
work O
related O
to O
filling O
the O
occupancy O
of O
the O
house O
and O
had O
to O
take O
care O
of O
all O
the O
work O
on O
the O
house O
as O
well O
as O
the O
happiness O
of O
the O
house O
’ O
s O
inhabitants O
. O

When O
the O
houses O
were O
emptied O
, O
the O
ban O
on O
leaving O
the O
barracks O
was O
lifted O
and O
Jews O
could O
now O
move O
freely O
around O
the O
ghetto O
. O

Only O
two O
streets O
remained O
closed O
off O
to O
Jews O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Aryan O
street O
, O
which O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
surrounding O
area O
used O
when O
they O
walked O
through O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
a O
street O
that O
led O
from O
the O
administrative O
building O
, O
i.e O
. O

from O
the O
center O
to O
the O
SS O
housing O
. O

Both O
streets O
were O
fenced O
off O
on O
both O
ends O
. O

Since O
it O
relates O
to O
the O
housing O
conditions O
, O
I O
will O
say O
a O
few O
things O
about O
the O
food O
. O

Food O
for O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
ghetto O
was O
cooked O
in O
five O
large O
kitchens O
. O

The O
bread O
was O
baked O
in O
two O
bakeries O
, O
and O
a O
portion O
was O
brought O
in O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

At O
first O
, O
the O
meals O
consisted O
of O
bread O
, O
soups O
made O
from O
kohlrabi O
, O
and O
bad O
potatoes O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
food O
improved O
. O

It O
was O
more O
varied O
, O
but O
the O
portions O
remained O
small O
and O
inadequate O
. O

Lunch O
was O
either O
potatoes O
, O
about O
30 O
to O
36 O
dkg O
with O
a O
tenth O
of O
a O
liter O
of O
beef O
stew O
or O
goulash O
, O
or O
roughly O
24 O
dkg O
of O
noodles O
or O
bread O
crumbs O
, O
sometimes O
about O
3 O
dkg O
of O
meat O
, O
or O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
millet O
mash O
or O
pearl O
barley O
. O

For O
dinner O
, O
about O
three O
times O
a O
week O
we O
received O
a O
thin O
soup O
, O
sometimes O
30 O
dkg O
of O
potatoes O
for O
peeling O
, O
and O
other O
times O
black O
coffee O
. O

Daily O
bread O
rations O
were O
35 O
dkg O
, O
those O
who O
worked O
long O
and O
hard O
received O
50 O
dkg O
. O

We O
also O
received O
60 O
dkg O
of O
margarine O
a O
week O
and O
7 O
dkg O
of O
sugar O
, O
the O
workers O
an O
additional O
2 O
dkg O
of O
margarine O
and O
3 O
dkg O
of O
sugar O
depending O
on O
the O
group O
they O
were O
part O
of O
. O

Work O
productivity O
was O
not O
the O
only O
deciding O
factor O
. O

Once O
a O
week O
, O
we O
received O
one O
quarter O
of O
a O
liter O
of O
milk O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
very O
long O
while O
, O
we O
got O
a O
bit O
of O
marmalade O
or O
3 O
- O
4 O
dkg O
of O
smoked O
meat O
, O
sometimes O
a O
piece O
of O
triangular O
cheese O
or O
liver O
pate O
from O
a O
can O
. O

But O
this O
happened O
only O
rarely O
. O

It O
’s O
easy O
to O
understand O
that O
this O
food O
left O
us O
very O
hungry O
. O

If O
you O
couldn’t O
procure O
any O
food O
, O
you O
went O
hungry O
. O

This O
was O
the O
case O
for O
the O
elderly O
and O
those O
who O
couldn’t O
work O
. O

Hunger O
, O
typhus O
, O
intestinal O
diseases O
, O
poor O
hygiene O
, O
housing O
conditions O
, O
and O
a O
lack O
of O
medicine O
claimed O
many O
victims O
among O
the O
old O
. O

During O
the O
last O
months O
of O
1942 B-DATE
and O
first O
months O
of O
1943 B-DATE
, O
about O
200 O
people O
died O
per O
day O
. O

Day O
and O
night O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
the O
ghetto O
, O
one O
could O
see O
hand O
- O
drawn O
carts O
carrying O
dead O
bodies O
to O
the O
death O
rooms O
. O

Despite O
their O
selfless O
work O
, O
the O
people O
who O
carted O
off O
the O
dead O
were O
not O
able O
to O
overcome O
the O
problems O
with O
moving O
the O
bodies O
and O
it O
often O
happened O
that O
corpses O
remained O
in O
crowded O
rooms O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
, O
or O
remained O
on O
stairways O
and O
front O
rooms O
. O

The O
dead O
were O
buried O
without O
a O
casket O
( O
in O
mass O
graves O
) O
. O

Later O
, O
after O
the O
crematorium O
was O
built O
, O
they O
were O
burned O
and O
the O
ashes O
were O
buried O
. O

In O
1943 B-DATE
, O
the O
death O
rate O
went O
down O
because O
a O
health O
service O
was O
established O
. O

There O
were O
hospitals O
and O
rooms O
for O
the O
sick O
. O

In O
the O
last O
weeks O
, O
about O
20 O
people O
died O
per O
day O
. O

The O
lower O
death O
rate O
can O
partly O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
most O
of O
the O
elderly O
were O
either O
transported O
east O
or O
had O
already O
died O
. O

A O
sad O
effect O
of O
our O
confinement O
was O
lice O
infestation O
, O
which O
shortly O
reached O
such O
a O
degree O
that O
it O
can O
safely O
be O
said O
that O
70 O
to O
80 O
% O
of O
all O
ghetto O
inhabitants O
had O
lice O
. O

This O
was O
because O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
housing O
spaces O
were O
terribly O
overcrowded O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
because O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
washrooms O
. O

The O
old O
and O
sick O
lay O
by O
the O
thousand O
on O
lice O
- O
infested O
beds O
, O
partly O
concentrated O
in O
special O
rooms O
inside O
houses O
, O
but O
there O
was O
such O
a O
small O
number O
of O
rooms O
in O
which O
there O
were O
people O
who O
were O
free O
of O
lice O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
nothing O
seemed O
to O
help O
alleviate O
our O
suffering O
. O

Experts O
, O
chemists O
, O
and O
doctors O
met O
and O
debated O
what O
method O
of O
delousing O
was O
the O
best O
, O
but O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
before O
they O
decided O
. O

Each O
person O
thought O
their O
opinion O
was O
the O
best O
and O
most O
fair O
. O

Finally O
, O
something O
was O
done O
. O

In O
the O
Jägerkaserne B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
people O
who O
couldn’t O
walk O
were O
disinfected O
, O
in O
the O
Hohenelber B-LOC
Kaserne B-LOC
those O
who O
could O
walk O
on O
their O
own O
were O
also O
disinfected O
. O

The O
way O
people O
were O
disinfected O
in O
the O
Jägerkaserne B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
was O
catastrophic O
. O

Older O
, O
weakened O
people O
, O
poorly O
dressed O
, O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
to O
the O
baths O
and O
back O
insufficiently O
covered O
. O

They O
came O
down O
with O
colds O
, O
got O
pneumonia O
, O
and O
died O
by O
the O
hundreds O
. O

People O
frequently O
returned O
still O
with O
lice O
to O
their O
rooms O
after O
they O
were O
deloused O
. O

Finally O
, O
there O
was O
a O
radical O
intervention O
. O

Homes O
were O
gradually O
emptied O
, O
filled O
with O
gas O
, O
during O
this O
time O
the O
inhabitants O
were O
washed O
, O
their O
clothes O
were O
disinfected O
, O
and O
only O
then O
did O
they O
return O
, O
deloused O
, O
to O
their O
clean O
apartments O
. O

Now O
everything O
depended O
on O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
houses O
to O
constantly O
check O
on O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
their O
houses O
, O
maintain O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
the O
bodies O
, O
clothes O
, O
and O
underwear O
, O
as O
well O
as O
beds O
, O
to O
prevent O
a O
new O
lice O
infestation O
. O

Another O
sad O
chapter O
of O
our O
time O
there O
was O
how O
the O
very O
elderly O
and O
sick O
people O
were O
treated O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
large O
number O
of O
them O
. O

These O
unfortunates O
had O
the O
worst O
housing O
. O

They O
lived O
in O
the O
worst O
rooms O
in O
the O
houses O
, O
and O
they O
were O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
old O
people O
's O
home O
in O
the O
riding O
barracks O
in O
large O
rooms O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
whose O
small O
barred O
windows O
let O
practically O
no O
air O
or O
daylight O
into O
the O
rooms O
. O

They O
lay O
by O
the O
hundreds O
in O
these O
rooms O
, O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
a O
retrained O
or O
wholly O
untrained O
staff O
. O

Care O
of O
the O
poorest O
was O
extremely O
humble O
. O

The O
medical O
staff O
took O
a O
cut O
of O
their O
already O
small O
food O
ration O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
ghetto O
leadership O
had O
no O
sympathy O
for O
the O
poorest O
, O
nor O
did O
it O
want O
to O
have O
any O
. O

It O
’s O
lamentable O
that O
many O
doctors O
and O
caretakers O
shared O
this O
sentiment O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
there O
were O
shortages O
, O
suffering O
, O
and O
hunger O
and O
on O
the O
other O
there O
was O
an O
entire O
group O
of O
ghetto O
inhabitants O
, O
and O
not O
a O
small O
one O
, O
that O
not O
only O
wasn’t O
poor O
, O
but O
actually O
had O
more O
of O
everything O
, O
including O
, O
food O
, O
delicacies O
, O
wine O
, O
liquor O
, O
tobacco O
, O
anything O
they O
wanted O
. O

They O
were O
employed O
in O
the O
various O
divisions O
of O
the O
economic O
administration O
, O
i.e O
. O

in O
the O
food O
warehouses O
, O
in O
the O
butcheries O
, O
bakeries O
, O
the O
kitchens O
, O
the O
package O
issuing O
office O
, O
etc O
. O

They O
stole O
at O
an O
unprecedented O
scale O
. O

In O
order O
to O
prevent O
theft O
, O
the O
Jewish O
administration O
established O
a O
special O
guard O
, O
such O
as O
the O
criminal O
police O
and O
supervisors O
in O
the O
kitchens O
. O

The O
result O
of O
this O
was O
that O
thefts O
actually O
increased O
, O
because O
the O
supervisors O
needed O
to O
be O
paid O
. O

Another O
group O
was O
the O
transport O
division O
, O
which O
received O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
luggage O
of O
the O
newly O
incoming O
transports O
. O

And O
then O
there O
were O
members O
of O
the O
deliveries O
division O
, O
who O
traded O
smuggled O
cigarettes O
and O
food O
. O

These O
people O
maintain O
close O
ties O
with O
Aryans O
and O
fraudulently O
smuggled O
out O
letters O
, O
which O
they O
didn’t O
do O
for O
free O
, O
of O
course O
. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
another O
group O
of O
intermediaries O
and O
those O
who O
bought O
up O
gold O
and O
other O
valuables O
. O

One O
can O
form O
an O
impression O
of O
the O
profits O
reaped O
by O
these O
tradesmen O
when O
one O
considers O
that O
a O
cigarette O
cost O
30 O
to O
35 O
crowns O
, O
and O
during O
the O
time O
when O
these O
fraudulent O
tradesmen O
were O
arrested O
and O
their O
money O
and O
cigarettes O
confiscated O
, O
the O
price O
of O
a O
cigarette O
rose O
to O
80 O
crowns O
. O

These O
people O
not O
only O
could O
afford O
any O
food O
and O
drink O
, O
but O
their O
limitless O
funds O
allowed O
them O
to O
acquire O
the O
best O
apartments O
as O
well O
. O

During O
our O
first O
night O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
we O
were O
woken O
by O
civil O
servants O
of O
the O
Jewish O
council O
, O
who O
called O
out O
names O
that O
they O
read O
off O
of O
paper O
rolls O
. O

I O
asked O
what O
was O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
and O
was O
told O
that O
those O
whose O
names O
were O
called O
out O
were O
to O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
next O
transport O
east O
. O

Of O
the O
1,000 O
Jews O
from O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
who O
arrived O
with O
me O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
more O
than O
half O
were O
placed O
on O
the O
transport O
and O
left O
three O
days O
later O
. O

In O
October B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
every O
third O
to O
fourth O
day O
, O
a O
transport O
containing O
thousands O
of O
younger O
and O
older O
left O
for O
the O
east O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
October B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
a O
gestapo B-ORG
order O
arrived O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
to O
take O
down O
the O
names O
of O
all O
people O
older O
than O
65 O
years O
of O
age O
. O

The O
list O
was O
created O
in O
the O
administrative O
rooms O
of O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
day O
and O
night O
. O

Old O
people O
were O
constantly O
being O
led O
to O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
, O
where O
they O
had O
to O
stand O
for O
hours O
waiting O
for O
all O
formalities O
of O
the O
list O
to O
be O
dealt O
with O
. O

Then O
a O
new O
list O
was O
created O
in O
the O
SS O
rooms O
, O
where O
people O
had O
to O
stand O
for O
hours O
yet O
again O
, O
this O
time O
outside O
. O

After O
this O
list O
, O
the O
letter O
O O
( O
for O
Osten O
, O
or O
east O
) O
or O
T B-GHETTO
( O
for O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
) O
was O
written O
in O
the O
individual O
’s O
personal O
file O
. O

The O
letter O
T B-GHETTO
was O
noted O
down O
only O
for O
those O
who O
had O
influential O
friends O
among O
NSDAP B-ORG
members O
. O

When O
, O
however O
, O
the O
transport O
lists O
were O
put O
together O
, O
people O
with O
both O
Os O
and O
T B-GHETTO
s O
were O
on O
them O
. O

When O
their O
registration O
was O
underway O
, O
an O
order O
came O
down O
that O
transports O
totalling O
2,000 O
protectorate O
inhabitants O
aged O
65 O
had O
to O
be O
put O
together O
, O
and O
that O
the O
first O
transport O
was O
to O
leave O
in O
three O
days O
, O
and O
the O
others O
every O
five O
to O
six O
days O
at O
the O
end O
of O
October B-DATE
. O

This O
report O
had O
the O
same O
effect O
as O
if O
a O
bomb O
had O
exploded O
. O

The O
mood O
in O
the O
ghetto O
is O
impossible O
to O
describe O
. O

It O
was O
a O
black O
day O
. O

It O
was O
rumored O
that O
these O
transports O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
Ostrov B-LOC
to O
an O
internment O
camp O
for O
officers O
from O
the O
1914 B-DATE
- O
1918 B-DATE
war O
, O
which O
would O
be O
turned O
into O
a O
ghetto O
for O
old O
people O
. O

I O
later O
learned O
that O
all O
of O
these O
transports O
, O
like O
the O
previous O
and O
subsequent O
transports O
, O
had O
gone O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

The O
departing O
transports O
were O
once O
again O
searched O
( O
we O
called O
it O
geschleusst O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
prisoners O
’ O
remaining O
property O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
departure O
, O
we O
saw O
old O
people O
who O
were O
still O
able O
to O
walk O
drag O
themselves O
through O
the O
ghetto O
to O
the O
barracks O
where O
the O
search O
( O
Schleusse O
) O
took O
place O
. O

Most O
were O
too O
sick O
and O
ill O
and O
had O
to O
be O
wheeled O
there O
on O
carts O
pushed O
and O
pulled O
by O
Jews O
. O

The O
dying O
were O
carted O
off O
to O
the O
barracks O
. O

Handled O
as O
if O
they O
were O
cheap O
sacks O
, O
the O
members O
of O
the O
administrative O
division O
dragged O
them O
from O
the O
carts O
. O

Jelínková B-PERS
of O
Vizovice B-LOC
and O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
executioner O
Karel B-PERS
Fischer I-PERS
Adolf O
Fischer O
of O
Prague B-LOC
excelled O
at O
this O
job O
. O

The O
same O
thing O
was O
repeated O
when O
these O
unfortunate O
souls O
were O
transported O
to O
the O
train O
station O
. O

There O
, O
the O
poor O
people O
were O
loaded O
into O
cattle O
cars O
and O
cruelly O
tortured O
by O
the O
SS O
on O
duty O
. O

SS O
members O
weren’t O
the O
only O
ones O
to O
act O
this O
way O
. O

Some O
protectorate O
policemen O
imitated O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
SS O
. O

The O
chief O
of O
police O
, O
captain O
Janeček B-PERS
, O
whose O
sadistic O
behavior O
was O
far O
worse O
than O
even O
that O
of O
the O
SS O
members O
, O
stood O
out O
in O
particular O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
the O
seriously O
ill O
died O
en O
route O
. O

Their O
corpses O
were O
loaded O
into O
the O
cars O
, O
because O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
’ O
s O
number O
had O
to O
be O
adhered O
to O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

The O
luggage O
of O
the O
people O
on O
the O
transports O
was O
, O
if O
they O
couldn’t O
carry O
them O
themselves O
, O
hauled O
to O
the O
train O
station O
on O
carts O
by O
the O
transport O
division O
and O
loaded O
into O
the O
train O
cars O
. O

It O
would O
often O
happen O
that O
the O
camp O
commander O
or O
his O
deputy O
Hauptsturmführer O
Bergl B-PERS
would O
suddenly O
forbid O
the O
further O
loading O
of O
luggage O
, O
and O
so O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
the O
luggage O
simply O
stayed O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
a O
significant O
number O
of O
people O
on O
the O
transports O
left O
with O
only O
some O
or O
none O
of O
the O
luggage O
. O

This O
sad O
theater O
was O
repeated O
several O
times O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
, O
because O
, O
besides O
the O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
inhabitants O
from O
the O
protectorate O
, O
10,000 O
elderly O
people O
from O
the O
Reich O
and O
Austria B-LOC
met O
the O
same O
fate O
. O

Terror O
and O
fear O
of O
the O
transports O
to O
the O
east O
continued O
to O
plague O
us O
, O
because O
after O
short O
breaks O
new O
transports O
kept O
departing O
to O
the O
east O
. O

In O
the O
days O
before O
each O
wave O
of O
transports O
, O
people O
in O
the O
ghetto O
were O
fearful O
and O
angry O
. O

Whenever O
Hauptsturmführer O
Möse B-PERS
would O
arrive O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
you O
knew O
that O
new O
transports O
were O
around O
the O
corner O
. O

Before O
the O
leadership O
officially O
announced O
them O
, O
people O
in O
the O
ghetto O
started O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
danger O
of O
the O
transports O
. O

Everywhere O
you O
looked O
were O
groups O
of O
scared O
, O
angry O
people O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
that O
which O
we O
were O
scared O
of O
always O
transpired O
. O

New O
transports O
were O
always O
put O
together O
again O
. O

The O
transport O
councilors O
of O
the O
Jewish O
council O
met O
day O
and O
night O
and O
consulted O
the O
current O
prisoner O
files O
to O
decide O
who O
would O
be O
placed O
on O
them O
. O

The O
various O
divisions O
had O
the O
right O
to O
claim O
that O
some O
people O
were O
indispensable O
and O
therefore O
save O
them O
from O
the O
transports O
. O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
say O
whether O
it O
was O
always O
well O
deserving O
and O
indispensable O
public O
servants O
who O
got O
saved O
. O

It O
was O
entirely O
up O
to O
the O
council O
to O
decide O
who O
would O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
transport O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
reasons O
that O
influenced O
the O
council O
members O
weren’t O
always O
objective O
. O

In O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Schleusse O
it O
was O
the O
members O
of O
the O
transport B-ORG
leadership I-ORG
who O
moved O
people O
off O
the O
list O
for O
money O
and O
a O
good O
word O
. O

When O
the O
council O
met O
, O
crowds O
of O
terrified O
people O
tried O
to O
push O
their O
way O
into O
the O
courtyard O
of O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
. O

Everyone O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
something O
about O
their O
own O
fate O
, O
tried O
to O
deflect O
the O
danger O
coming O
their O
way O
based O
on O
relationships O
formed O
or O
other O
means O
. O

After O
negotiations O
that O
lasted O
for O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
the O
lists O
were O
finally O
put O
together O
and O
at O
night O
— O
only O
at O
night O
— O
slips O
with O
their O
names O
and O
the O
message O
that O
they O
would O
be O
transported O
were O
given O
to O
the O
people O
who O
were O
to O
be O
on O
the O
transports O
. O

On O
those O
nights O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
sleep O
. O

Everyone O
waiting O
to O
be O
summoned O
. O

In O
the O
barracks O
, O
they O
were O
delivered O
by O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
barracks O
, O
and O
in O
the O
apartments O
by O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
houses O
. O

The O
rolls O
with O
the O
list O
of O
the O
transported O
were O
delivered O
one O
by O
one O
, O
everyone O
waited O
anxiously O
whether O
the O
elders O
would O
come O
to O
their O
room O
and O
who O
would O
be O
next O
. O

To O
ratchet O
up O
the O
tension O
, O
the O
transport O
slips O
weren’t O
delivered O
all O
at O
once O
, O
but O
in O
stages O
. O

Until O
the O
transports O
departed O
, O
one O
could O
never O
be O
sure O
whether O
one O
wouldn’t O
be O
summoned O
, O
because O
someone O
was O
sick O
or O
knew O
how O
to O
pull O
some O
strings O
, O
some O
people O
were O
taken O
off O
of O
the O
transport O
lists O
and O
the O
council O
was O
in O
constant O
session O
up O
until O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
transports O
in O
order O
to O
select O
any O
eventual O
replacements O
. O

And O
so O
fear O
and O
anger O
took O
hold O
until O
the O
last O
minute O
and O
dissipated O
only O
once O
the O
train O
departed O
. O

It O
’s O
difficult O
to O
describe O
the O
feelings O
of O
the O
elders O
of O
the O
houses O
, O
whose O
task O
it O
was O
to O
deliver O
the O
sad O
news O
to O
someone O
that O
they O
would O
be O
leaving O
. O

When O
I O
stepped O
into O
a O
room O
with O
a O
roll O
and O
turned O
the O
light O
on O
, O
people O
gazed O
at O
me O
wide O
- O
eyed O
and O
I O
read O
the O
question O
in O
their O
eyes O
: O
am O
I O
on O
them O
? O
And O
then O
the O
hardest O
part O
: O
preparing O
someone O
who O
was O
to O
be O
transported O
. O

Despair O
, O
wails O
, O
and O
tears O
broke O
out O
, O
especially O
when O
, O
as O
it O
often O
happened O
, O
families O
were O
torn O
apart O
, O
parents O
from O
children O
or O
siblings O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
make O
peace O
with O
your O
fate O
. O

Everyone O
got O
up O
and O
helped O
the O
person O
pack O
. O

Many O
summoned O
people O
tried O
a O
last O
ditch O
intervention O
at O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
to O
reverse O
their O
fate O
or O
ran O
to O
the O
doctor O
to O
get O
a O
confirmation O
that O
he O
or O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
be O
transported O
. O

Few O
were O
successful O
. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
make O
your O
way O
to O
the O
search O
, O
to O
the O
train O
station O
, O
and O
then O
to O
the O
east O
. O

For O
many O
days O
after O
the O
transports O
departed O
the O
mood O
remained O
uneasy O
. O

When O
nerves O
were O
somewhat O
calmed O
, O
the O
danger O
of O
new O
transports O
loomed O
once O
more O
. O

The O
number O
of O
transports O
finally O
went O
down O
in O
mid O
1943 O
, O
but O
the O
September O
and O
December B-DATE
1943 I-DATE
and O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
transports O
carried O
five O
thousand O
people O
each O
from O
the O
ghetto O
. O

In O
September B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
the O
evacuation O
of O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto O
began O
and O
by O
the O
end O
of O
October B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
about O
16,000 O
people O
were O
deported O
. O

When O
these O
transports O
were O
put O
together O
, O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
, O
who O
, O
after O
the O
elder O
Dr O
. O

Epstein B-PERS
was O
arrested O
, O
took O
over O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
ghetto O
, O
and O
his O
secretary O
Brochnik B-PERS
Prochnik O
distinguished O
themselves O
. O

Many O
head O
civil O
servants O
, O
who O
for O
whatever O
reason O
fell O
into O
disfavor O
with O
these O
men O
would O
soon O
find O
out O
exactly O
what O
that O
meant O
. O

Camp O
commander O
Hauptsturmführer O
Rahm B-PERS
then O
publicly O
announced O
that O
a O
new O
work O
camp O
would O
be O
established O
close O
to O
Dresden B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
also O
told O
that O
only O
reliable O
people O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
placed O
on O
this O
new O
transport O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
already O
been O
punished O
were O
not O
allowed O
on O
it O
. O

5,000 O
men O
were O
supposed O
to O
leave O
to O
go O
to O
the O
new O
camp O
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
central B-ORG
secretariat I-ORG
, O
Ing O
. O

Otto B-PERS
Zucker I-PERS
, O
was O
to O
lead O
the O
new O
camp O
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
economic B-ORG
division I-ORG
, O
Schliesser B-PERS
, O
was O
assigned O
to O
him O
and O
his O
task O
was O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
economic O
matters O
connected O
with O
the O
establishment O
of O
a O
ghetto O
. O

The O
gestapo B-ORG
promised O
the O
wives O
and O
closest O
relatives O
of O
those O
who O
were O
supposed O
to O
leave O
that O
they O
would O
be O
protected O
and O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
transports O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
first O
transport O
carrying O
1,500 O
men O
left O
, O
and O
with O
it O
Ing O
. O

Zucker B-PERS
and O
Schliesser B-PERS
. O

Three O
days O
later O
, O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
issued O
a O
proclamation O
stating O
that O
the O
camp O
commander O
was O
allowing O
500 O
women O
to O
go O
to O
their O
husbands O
on O
the O
third O
transport O
together O
with O
the O
men O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
this O
was O
a O
singular O
opportunity O
that O
was O
offered O
to O
the O
women O
by O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
that O
they O
should O
volunteer O
by O
6 O
pm O
. O

After O
this O
deadline O
, O
they O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
accepted O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
second O
transport O
departed O
with O
1,500 O
men O
. O

The O
women O
were O
to O
leave O
on O
the O
third O
transport O
. O

However O
, O
since O
only O
500 O
women O
volunteered O
, O
the O
transport B-ORG
council I-ORG
topped O
up O
the O
number O
and O
placed O
the O
women O
as O
it O
saw O
fit O
. O

The O
third O
transport O
was O
put O
together O
. O

I O
was O
also O
placed O
on O
it O
together O
with O
my O
wife O
. O

We O
traveled O
on O
passenger O
cars O
accompanied O
by O
the O
SS O
and O
the O
Schupo B-ORG
. O

It O
was O
rumored O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
Reich O
to O
a O
new O
camp O
close O
to O
Dresden B-LOC
. O

We O
totalled O
1,000 O
men O
and O
500 O
women O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Dresden B-LOC
, O
but O
continued O
on O
, O
and O
when O
we O
got O
to O
Görlitz B-LOC
, O
we O
realized O
that O
everything O
that O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
told O
us O
were O
lies O
as O
usual O
. O

We O
weren’t O
going O
to O
a O
new O
labor O
camp O
, O
but O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

We O
arrived O
there O
after O
a O
36 O
hour O
ride O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
all O
of O
our O
luggage O
on O
the O
train O
. O

Right O
after O
we O
disembarked O
we O
were O
separated O
from O
the O
women O
, O
and O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
again O
. O

Then O
Obersturmbannführer O
Mengele B-PERS
, O
a O
doctor O
, O
conducted O
the O
selection O
. O

Out O
of O
1,000 O
men O
, O
only O
462 O
arrived O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
the O
others O
, O
as O
we O
later O
learned O
, O
went O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

From O
October B-DATE
30th I-DATE
until O
the O
day O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Buchenwald B-CAMP
, O
about O
16,000 O
Jews O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
70 O
% O
of O
whom O
were O
immediately O
taken O
to O
the O
gas O
chambers O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
whether O
more O
transports O
left O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
after O
that O
and O
I O
also O
don’t O
know O
whether O
all O
of O
the O
Jews O
were O
evacuated O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

But O
let O
’s O
return O
now O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
: O
The O
leadership O
of O
the O
ghetto O
belonged O
to O
the O
service O
post O
of O
the O
SS O
that O
was O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

The O
commander O
was O
SS O
Hauptsturmführer O
Dr O
. O

Seidl B-PERS
, O
his O
deputy O
was O
camp O
inspector O
SS O
Hauptsturmführer O
Bergl B-PERS
. O

Guarding O
it O
was O
given O
over O
to O
the O
protectorate O
police O
division O
led O
by O
first O
lieutenant O
of O
the O
police O
Janeček B-PERS
. O

The O
elder O
of O
the O
ghetto O
and O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
were O
responsible O
for O
carrying O
out O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
elder O
of O
the O
camp O
during O
my O
time O
there O
was O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
, O
his O
deputy O
ing O
. O

Zucker B-PERS
. O

In O
reality O
, O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
was O
a O
mere O
decoy O
because O
it O
wasn’t O
able O
to O
make O
decisions O
about O
anything O
. O

During O
their O
sessions O
, O
members O
were O
only O
told O
which O
orders O
for O
the O
ghetto O
elder O
were O
from O
the O
post O
of O
the O
SS O
( O
Dienstelle O
) O
and O
what O
to O
do O
to O
fulfil O
these O
orders O
. O

They O
didn’t O
vote O
, O
all O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
take O
the O
relevant O
orders O
into O
consideration O
. O

Without O
permission O
, O
neither O
the O
ghetto O
elder O
nor O
any O
member O
of O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Dienststelle O
in O
regard O
to O
any O
matter O
. O

The O
only O
exception O
was O
Dr O
. O

Löwenstein B-PERS
. O

This O
baptized O
Jew O
, O
a O
former O
German B-LOC
active O
officer O
, O
arrived O
from O
Minsk B-GHETTO
in O
1943 B-DATE
where O
he O
was O
the O
head O
of O
the O
local O
Jewish O
ghetto O
police O
, O
and O
was O
placed O
in O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
of I-LOC
Theresienstadt I-LOC
( O
concentration O
camp O
) O
. O

After O
a O
short O
stint O
in O
jail O
he O
was O
assigned O
to O
the O
ghetto O
as O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
guards B-ORG
based O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
gestapo B-ORG
. O

In O
his O
first O
days O
he O
was O
presented O
to O
the O
SS O
commander O
of O
the O
ghetto O
by O
the O
elder O
, O
but O
in O
a O
short O
while O
he O
was O
able O
to O
get O
there O
by O
himself O
without O
the O
elder O
. O

It O
was O
learned O
that O
Dr O
. O

L. B-PERS
was O
acting O
as O
an O
informer O
. O

He O
would O
show O
up O
without O
an O
invitation O
and O
without O
being O
asked O
, O
even O
to O
wholly O
private O
meetings O
in O
order O
to O
spy O
. O

A O
struggle O
over O
him O
broke O
out O
immediately O
, O
but O
it O
was O
exceedingly O
difficult O
to O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

Only O
if O
he O
went O
against O
the O
explicit O
wishes O
of O
the O
SS O
leader O
and O
did O
something O
to O
benefit O
the O
elders O
would O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
dishonesty O
while O
carrying O
out O
his O
duties O
, O
charge O
him O
, O
and O
remove O
him O
from O
his O
post O
. O

Until O
then O
, O
he O
was O
constantly O
monitored O
by O
the O
Jewish O
criminal O
police O
. O

In O
1943 B-DATE
, O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
elder O
of O
the O
Jews O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
and O
former O
Rabbi O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
and O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
Reich O
’ O
s O
commissioner O
for O
carrying O
out O
the O
final O
solution O
to O
the O
Jewish O
question O
the O
leadership O
was O
changed O
. O

The O
elder O
became O
Dr O
. O

Epstein B-PERS
, O
the O
1 O
. O

deputy O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
the O
2 O
. O

deputy O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstein B-PERS
. O

Unlike O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
who O
, O
if O
it O
were O
possible O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
acted O
on O
his O
own O
initiative O
and O
at O
each O
opportunity O
attempted O
to O
get O
the O
SS O
leadership O
to O
agree O
to O
reliefs O
for O
the O
Jews O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
who O
sometimes O
didn’t O
carry O
out O
orders O
that O
were O
unfavorable O
to O
Jews O
, O
Dr O
. O

Epstein B-PERS
announced O
ahead O
of O
time O
that O
he O
would O
100 O
% O
fulfil O
any O
order O
that O
the O
SS O
would O
give O
him O
. O

This O
wasn’t O
very O
pleasant O
for O
us O
. O

We O
hadn’t O
heard O
anything O
good O
about O
Dr O
. O

Murmelstain B-PERS
. O

In O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
he O
was O
a O
toady O
for O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
, O
blindly O
followed O
all O
of O
the O
orders O
he O
was O
given O
and O
even O
more O
to O
get O
into O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
’ O
s O
good O
graces O
. O

He O
was O
also O
brutal O
and O
even O
, O
as O
eyewitnesses O
report O
, O
beat O
the O
workers O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

Life O
in O
the O
ghetto O
was O
controlled O
by O
regulations O
and O
the O
order O
that O
was O
issued O
by O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
. O

Besides O
this O
order O
, O
a O
whole O
series O
of O
prohibitions O
were O
in O
place O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
was O
forbidden O
to O
have O
money O
, O
gold O
, O
valuables O
, O
tea O
, O
coffee O
, O
tobacco O
, O
and O
smoking O
was O
also O
banned O
. O

It O
was O
forbidden O
to O
have O
contacts O
with O
Aryans O
and O
be O
in O
any O
kind O
of O
written O
touch O
with O
people O
outside O
of O
the O
ghetto O
. O

Writing O
in O
general O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
and O
breaking O
this O
order O
was O
punished O
by O
death O
. O

For O
this O
offence O
, O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
camp O
commander O
Dr O
. O

Seidl B-PERS
, O
9 O
Jews O
, O
most O
of O
them O
young O
, O
were O
executed O
on O
January B-DATE
10th I-DATE
, O
and O
7 O
on O
February B-DATE
26th I-DATE
. O

The O
entire O
population O
had O
to O
watch O
the O
execution O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
ghetto O
commander O
. O

Karel B-PERS
Fischer I-PERS
, O
by O
trade O
a O
butcher O
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
carried O
out O
the O
executions O
. O

He O
was O
also O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
dissecting O
room O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
medical O
faculty O
of O
the O
university O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

All O
sixteen O
who O
were O
sentenced O
to O
death O
died O
as O
heroes O
. O

When O
they O
were O
led O
to O
the O
scaffold O
they O
swore O
at O
the O
SS O
and O
spat O
on O
them O
. O

Only O
one O
of O
them O
cried O
and O
called O
out O
before O
the O
execution O
I O
didn’t O
do O
anything O
wrong O
, O
I O
only O
wrote O
to O
my O
mother O
. O

Other O
offenses O
were O
punished O
by O
jail O
terms O
and O
being O
shipped O
out O
on O
the O
next O
transport O
, O
or O
being O
transferred O
to O
the O
small B-LOC
fortress I-LOC
( I-LOC
concentration I-LOC
camp I-LOC
) I-LOC
Theresienstadt I-LOC
. O

I O
find O
it O
pointless O
to O
report O
on O
the O
SS O
’ O
s O
methods O
of O
interrogation O
, O
because O
these O
methods O
are O
known O
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

All O
methods O
were O
used O
, O
from O
beatings O
to O
burnings O
with O
hot O
iron O
, O
from O
suffering O
to O
all O
kinds O
of O
cruelty O
that O
could O
only O
have O
emerged O
from O
the O
brains O
of O
the O
SS O
. O

Hauptsturmführer O
Bergl B-PERS
, O
who O
was O
almost O
always O
present O
during O
interrogations O
, O
excelled O
in O
particular O
. O

This O
doesn’t O
mean O
that O
other O
camp O
commanders O
would O
not O
have O
actively O
participated O
in O
the O
interrogations O
. O

During O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
I O
came O
to O
know O
three O
of O
them O
: O
These O
were O
Dr O
. O

Seidl B-PERS
, O
Burger B-PERS
, O
and O
Rahm B-PERS
. O

For O
example O
, O
during O
an O
interrogation O
, O
Hauptsturmführer O
Rahm B-PERS
broke O
three O
chairs O
over O
the O
head O
of O
one O
offender O
. O

Let O
us O
also O
remember O
Scharführer O
Heinl B-PERS
, O
who O
was O
extremely O
unpleasant O
during O
interrogations O
and O
otherwise O
and O
didn’t O
lag O
behind O
the O
others O
in O
his O
brutality O
. O

Despite O
all O
of O
the O
restrictions O
and O
strict O
punishments O
, O
Jews O
maintained O
active O
relations O
with O
the O
Aryans O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
policemen O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
brought O
food O
and O
cigarettes O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
and O
snuck O
letters O
out O
. O

I O
must O
note O
that O
most O
of O
the O
policemen O
treated O
us O
very O
well O
. O

Contacts O
with O
Jews O
and O
fraudulent O
transport O
, O
when O
they O
became O
known O
, O
had O
very O
unpleasant O
consequences O
for O
the O
policeman O
for O
he O
was O
arrested O
immediately O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
most O
of O
them O
didn’t O
let O
it O
stop O
them O
and O
they O
supported O
us O
. O

But O
there O
were O
also O
some O
very O
unpleasant O
men O
among O
the O
police O
, O
who O
rivalled O
the O
SS O
in O
their O
treatment O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
such O
as O
the O
previously O
mentioned O
first O
lieutenant O
Janeček B-PERS
, O
the O
constable O
Ulmann B-PERS
, O
lieutenant O
Hasenkop B-PERS
Hasenkopf O
, O
and O
Hašek B-PERS
. O

If O
the O
first O
lieutenant O
Janeček B-PERS
caught O
a O
policeman O
in O
conversation O
with O
a O
Jew O
, O
then O
all O
Jews O
were O
beaten O
and O
denounced O
to O
the O
SS O
just O
like O
the O
policeman O
. O

Almost O
all O
Aryans O
who O
were O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
like O
the O
railway O
workers O
who O
rode O
to O
Bohušovice B-LOC
and O
the O
civilians O
who O
came O
into O
contact O
with O
Jews O
due O
to O
work O
, O
brought O
us O
food O
and O
cigarettes O
. O

The O
Aryan O
coach O
drivers O
who O
removed O
garbage O
from O
the O
ghetto O
smuggled O
in O
food O
for O
us O
. O

Sudden O
unannounced O
searches O
in O
the O
barracks O
were O
often O
helped O
by O
the O
policemen O
and O
ghetto B-ORG
guards B-ORG
. O

Searches O
were O
conducted O
by O
SS O
members O
. O

Sometimes O
they O
happened O
during O
the O
day O
, O
sometimes O
at O
night O
. O

Some O
forbidden O
items O
were O
always O
found O
. O

We O
knew O
that O
almost O
all O
of O
these O
searches O
were O
conducted O
based O
on O
denouncements O
by O
Jews O
, O
we O
knew O
that O
informers O
could O
be O
found O
among O
the O
members O
of O
the O
former O
Jewish B-ORG
police B-ORG
of O
Vienna B-LOC
who O
previously O
collaborated O
with O
the O
Scharführer O
Heinl B-PERS
, O
but O
we O
almost O
never O
safely O
found O
out O
who O
the O
perpetrators O
were O
. O

The O
arrests O
and O
the O
interrogations O
, O
during O
which O
the O
investigated O
were O
reluctant O
to O
divulge O
the O
names O
of O
the O
Aryans O
they O
were O
in O
contact O
with O
, O
were O
accompanied O
with O
the O
toughest O
torture O
. O

Some O
collapsed O
during O
these O
terrible O
interrogations O
and O
named O
their O
suppliers O
who O
were O
usually O
Jews O
as O
well O
as O
Aryans O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
new O
arrests O
, O
new O
interrogations O
, O
and O
yet O
more O
arrests O
. O

Every O
day O
brought O
newer O
and O
ever O
more O
unpleasant O
surprises O
. O

One O
day O
was O
never O
like O
another O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
November B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
a O
punishment O
was O
meted O
out O
upon O
the O
entire O
ghetto O
for O
spitting O
and O
throwing O
paper O
out O
on O
the O
street O
: O
no O
walks O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
no O
street O
lighting O
. O

On O
the O
orders O
of O
Dr O
. O

Seidl B-PERS
. O

In O
September B-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
several O
hundred O
children O
from O
Bialostok B-GHETTO
whose O
parents O
were O
murdered O
by O
the O
Nazis O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

They O
were O
housed O
in O
the O
barracks O
outside O
of O
the O
ghetto O
and O
the O
ghetto O
inhabitants O
were O
forbidden O
to O
have O
any O
kind O
of O
contact O
with O
them O
under O
pain O
of O
punishment O
. O

Jewish O
doctors O
and O
nurses O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
house O
a O
day O
earlier O
, O
they O
were O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
meeting O
anyone O
in O
the O
ghetto O
. O

And O
they O
truly O
never O
met O
anyone O
. O

The O
children O
were O
led O
by O
the O
large O
SS O
guard O
to O
the O
delousing O
bath O
in O
the O
ghetto O
. O

The O
sight O
was O
heart O
wrenching O
. O

A O
line O
of O
scared O
, O
shy O
children O
, O
dirty O
, O
downtrodden O
, O
and O
terribly O
starved O
. O

Terrible O
scenes O
took O
place O
in O
front O
of O
the O
bath O
. O

Children O
were O
unwilling O
to O
enter O
the O
bath O
and O
constantly O
shouted O
Nicht O
, O
nicht O
, O
gas O
. O

( O
No O
, O
no O
, O
gas O
. O

) O
. O

Only O
once O
I O
got O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
myself O
did O
I O
understand O
why O
the O
children O
had O
been O
so O
scared O
. O

The O
Jewish O
doctors O
and O
caretakers O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
calming O
the O
children O
down O
and O
getting O
them O
to O
the O
baths O
. O

Then O
the O
children O
were O
clothed O
in O
new O
clothes O
and O
an O
order O
arrived O
that O
they O
were O
to O
be O
specially O
and O
plentifully O
fed O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
these O
children O
were O
to O
be O
exchanged O
and O
would O
be O
transported O
through O
Turkey B-LOC
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Several O
weeks O
later O
, O
these O
children O
were O
indeed O
sent O
with O
the O
doctors O
and O
caretakers O
without O
allowing O
any O
of O
them O
the O
possibility O
of O
saying O
goodbye O
to O
any O
of O
their O
people O
. O

I O
later O
learned O
that O
all O
of O
the O
children O
together O
with O
their O
entire O
staff O
were O
sent O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
and O
gassed O
. O

In O
November B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
the O
camp O
leadership O
ordered O
a O
census O
of O
the O
entire O
population O
. O

It O
was O
held O
on O
November O
10th O
in O
the O
Bohušovická B-LOC
hollow O
. O

Except O
for O
the O
seriously O
ill O
, O
who O
were O
then O
concentrated O
into O
two O
barracks O
together O
with O
newborns O
and O
their O
mothers O
and O
counted O
there O
, O
everyone O
had O
to O
come O
out O
with O
their O
children O
and O
strollers O
and O
march O
at O
six O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
the O
Bohušovická B-LOC
hollow O
. O

They O
stood O
outside O
all O
day O
and O
were O
counted O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O

A O
whole O
flock O
of O
gestapo B-ORG
came O
to O
Prague B-LOC
for O
this O
very O
purpose O
. O

It O
was O
winter O
, O
raining O
, O
and O
snowing O
, O
and O
we O
froze O
considerably O
. O

It O
was O
getting O
dark O
and O
we O
were O
getting O
ready O
to O
stand O
outside O
all O
night O
. O

Just O
then O
an O
order O
came O
to O
return O
to O
the O
ghetto O
. O

It O
was O
completely O
dark O
when O
we O
began O
marching O
back O
. O

In O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
we O
were O
crushed O
by O
the O
news O
that O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
and O
many O
leading O
civil O
servants O
of O
the O
ghetto O
were O
arrested O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
they O
were O
arrested O
for O
mistakes O
they O
made O
when O
they O
put O
together O
the O
transports O
in O
November B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
. O

Some O
changes O
had O
been O
made O
to O
them O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
it O
happened O
with O
almost O
every O
transport O
that O
people O
who O
could O
either O
bribe O
or O
use O
their O
contacts O
were O
taken O
off O
the O
transports O
at O
the O
last O
minute O
. O

But O
Edelstein B-PERS
didn’t O
coordinate O
these O
changes O
. O

He O
was O
simply O
made O
responsible O
for O
all O
of O
the O
mistakes O
that O
the O
civil O
servants O
made O
. O

After O
several O
days O
in O
jail O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
with O
all O
of O
the O
other O
arrested O
people O
and O
there O
, O
as O
I O
later O
learned O
, O
imprisoned O
for O
a O
time O
in O
the O
bunker O
and O
then O
shot O
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
his O
wife O
and O
small O
child O
shared O
his O
fate O
. O

Another O
phenomenon O
that O
was O
a O
daily O
occurrence O
must O
be O
mentioned O
. O

It O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ladybirds O
. O

The O
people O
living O
in O
the O
rooms O
in O
which O
the O
ladybirds O
were O
conducting O
their O
activity O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
rooms O

their O

began O
. O

Everything O
in O

was O
turned O
over O
, O
turned O
upside O
down O

and O
they O
collected O
whatever O
they O
liked O

whatever O
they O
found O

When O
they O
left O
the O

the O
inhabitants O
returned O
again O

it O
took O
several O
hours O
before O
everything O

again O

To O
my O
report O
on O
everyday O
affairs O
, O
I’d O
like O
to O
say O
something O
about O
the O
employment O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
ghetto O
: O
every O
woman O
and O
every O
man O
were O
put O
to O
work O
immediately O
after O
their O
arrival O
to O
the O
ghetto O
. O

Everyone O
had O
to O
, O
before O
being O
issued O
a O
permanent O
job O
either O
in O
the O
administration O
or O
work O
doing O
manual O
labor O
for O
a O
time O
in O
a O
group O
of O
one O
hundred O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
organized O
into O
a O
group O
of O
one O
hundred O
were O
issued O
work O
everyday O
. O

Women O
generally O
cleaned O
, O
and O
men O
did O
jobs O
of O
all O
types O
. O

Each O
had O
the O
option O
to O
sign O
up O
for O
the O
job O
they O
thought O
they O
were O
best O
suited O
for O
. O

They O
could O
submit O
their O
curriculum O
vitae O
to O
the O
relevant O
division O
and O
if O
the O
head O
of O
the O
division O
thought O
that O
the O
applicant O
could O
be O
employed O
, O
he O
requested O
the O
central O
labor O
office O
to O
grant O
the O
applicant O
the O
job O
at O
the O
relevant O
division O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
labor O
office O
released O
the O
applicant O
from O
this O
current O
employment O
, O
the O
request O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
personnel B-ORG
division I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
to O
approve O
the O
position O
. O

Only O
this O
approval O
was O
the O
final O
and O
valid O
one O

all O

to O
them O
could O
be O
found O
. O

Besides O
this O
, O
men O
worked O
as O
street O
sweepers O
, O
gutter O
cleaners O
, O
corpse O

, O
and O
worked O
in O
shafts O
. O

Women O
mostly O
arranged O

worked O
as O
nurses O
, O
and O
in O
colonies O
of O
cleaning O
ladies O
for O
the O
barracks O
and O
houses O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
important O
divisions O
was O
the O
installation O
division O
. O

People O
from O
this O
division O
had O
to O
install O
an O
entire O
network O
of O
water O
mains O
in O
the O
town O
, O
which O
had O
up O
to O
now O
provided O
for O
the O
normal O
usage O
of O
water O
from O
wells O
for O
about O
5,000 O
inhabitants O
. O

Engineers O
and O
workers O
worked O
without O
stopping O
and O
they O
actually O
managed O
to O
hook O
up O
almost O
every O
house O
to O
the O
water O
supply O
system O
in O
a O
short O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

In O
many O
houses O
flushing O
toilets O
were O
installed O
and O
washrooms O
and O
showers O
were O
equipped O
. O

In O
a O
short O
time O
, O
Jews O
also O
built O
the O
track O
from O
Bohušovice B-LOC
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Except O
for O
work O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
there O
was O
work O
to O
do O
for O
the O
SS O
and O
for O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

For O
the O
SS O
, O
it O
was O
mostly O
agricultural O
work O
, O
which O
employed O
about O
1,200 O
people O
, O
mostly O
women O
. O

Then O
there O
was O
the O
work O
on O
the O
small O
fortress O
that O
was O
carried O
out O
by O
roughly O
twenty O
men O
. O

This O
commando O
was O
undoubtedly O
the O
worst O
because O
the O
SS O
who O
were O
in O
the O
small B-LOC
fortress I-LOC
would O
constantly O
beat O
these O
people O
. O

The O
divisions O
that O
was O
under O
the O
control O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
and O
under O
the O
direct O
supervision O
of O
the O
SS O
were O
the O
following O
: O
the O
manufacture O
of O
crates O
, O
the O
dressmaker O
’ O

, O
the O
uniform O

called O
Bekleidungskammer O
) O
i.e O
. O

a O
clothing O

, O
the O
applied O
arts O
division O
. O

In O
these O
divisions O
, O
3,000 O
- O
3,500 O
were O
employed O
, O
mostly O
women O
. O

In O
the O
chambers O
in O
which O
mostly O
women O
were O
employed O
, O
the O
luggage O
was O
opened O
and O
confiscated O
from O
those O
who O
had O
arrived O
and O
their O
contents O
was O
sorted O
. O

Clothes O
, O
shoes O
, O
undergarments O
, O
everything O
was O
divided O
into O
three O
groups O
. O

Groups O
I O
and O
II O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
Reich O
, O
things O
in O
group O
III O
, O
i.e O
. O

things O
that O
were O
basically O
unusable O
were O
given O
over O
to O
the O
Jewish O
administration O
. O

Jews O
were O
clothed O
in O
things O
from O
these O
. O

Supervision O
was O
the O
purview O
of O
the O
SS O
and O
the O
police O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
women O
who O
worked O
for O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
, O
who O
carried O
out O
body O
searches O
on O
the O
women O
, O
when O
they O
left O
their O
workplaces O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
women O
needed O
to O
take O
all O
of O
their O
clothes O
off O
. O

They O
were O
also O
supervised O
by O
the O
overseer O
women O
of O
the O
Jewish O
criminal O
police O
. O

It O
must O
be O
said O
that O
these O
female O
overseers O
were O
often O
more O
pleasant O
than O
the O
German B-LOC
women O
. O

Mrs O

Saša B-PERS

an O

lived O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
distinguished O
herself O
as O
an O
informer O
. O

The O
SS O
allowed O
the O
large O
number O
of O
artists O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
to O
take O
over O
the O
agenda O
of O
entertaining O
during O
the O
population O
’s O
free O
time O
. O

There O
were O
active O
artists O
of O
all O
disciplines O
. O

Opera O
, O
opereta O
, O
oratoria O
, O
symphonies O
, O
solos O
, O
chamber O
music O
, O
cabarets O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
this O
entertainment O
took O
place O
in O
the O
large O
hall O
of O
the O
Magdeburger B-LOC
Kaserne I-LOC
. O

Later O
, O
a O
concert O

in O
the O
town O
hall O
as O
well O
as O
the O
cinema O
and O
school O
hall O
in O
the O
Sports B-LOC
grounds I-LOC
were O
also O
used O
. O

There O
were O
also O
various O
performances O
in O
the O
attics O
of O
the O
various O
houses O
that O
were O
especially O
adjusted O
for O
these O
purposes O
. O

With O
the O
simplest O
and O
primitive O
resources O
, O
some O
very O
wonderful O
results O
were O
achieved O
. O

These O
performances O
were O
a O
ray O
of O
light O
in O
the O
grey O
drabness O
of O
our O
existence O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Sports O
of O
all O
kinds O
were O
practiced O
, O
especially O
football O
. O

Proper O
races O
were O
attended O
by O
thousands O
of O
viewers O
, O
and O
policemen O
and O
SS O
members O
came O
to O
watch O
them O
in O
secret O
. O

In O
1945 B-DATE
, O
a O
concert O
coffee O
house O
was O
established O
and O
organized O
by O
the O
trumpet O
band O
that O
played O
on O
the O
town O
square O
every O
day O
. O

The O
latter O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
grocery O
store O
and O
two O
clothing O
stores O
, O
whose O
only O
goods O
were O
displayed O
in O
their O
display O
windows O
, O
borrowed O
from O
warehouses O
, O
were O
established O
only O
because O
of O
the O
awaited O
committee O
from O
a O
neutral O
foreign O
country O
. O

After O
a O
few O
months O
, O
the O
beautification O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
carried O
out O
. O

On O
the O
Main O
Square O
, O
lawns O
and O
roses O
were O
planted O
. O

Houses O
were O
fixed O
, O
painted O
anew O
, O
curtains O
were O
hung O
on O
windows O
, O
but O
only O
those O
facing O
the O
street O
that O
the O
committee O
would O
be O
walking O
down O
on O
. O

The O
number O
of O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
houses O
was O
decreased O
and O
the O
third O
bunk O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
beds O
. O

Entire O
homes O
were O
emptied O
out O
, O
new O
furniture O
was O
moved O
in O
, O
curtains O
were O
hung O
in O
every O
window O
, O
in O
each O
room O
a O
family O
with O
at O
most O
three O
members O
were O
brought O
to O
live O
. O

For O
the O
Danes B-LOC
, O
special O
housing O
was O
quickly O
arranged O
and O
made O
ready O
since O
the O
families O
had O
to O
move O
into O
them O
in O
only O
several O
hours O
. O

In O
short O
, O
we O
built O
a O
Potěmkin O
Village O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
show O
the O
committee O
that O
Jews O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
have O
beautiful O
housing O
and O
are O
extremely O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

On O
the O
day O
that O
the O
committee O
was O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
we O
received O
the O
best O
food O
and O
twice O
as O
much O
of O
it O
as O
usual O
. O

The O
Third O
Reich O
shall O
not O
let O
the O
Jews O
starve O
. O

But O
not O
sooner O
had O
the O
committee O
left O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
than O
the O
Danes B-LOC
were O
ordered O
to O
vacate O
the O
once O
again O
made O
pretty O
apartments O
and O
move O
back O
to O
their O
former O
lodging O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
remained O
there O
were O
the O
curtains O
in O
the O
windows O
. O

Before O
the O
visit O
of O
the O
committee O
, O
a O
propaganda O
film O
was O
made O
. O

For O
the O
movie O
, O
large O
signs O
were O
placed O
on O
the O
front O
of O
the O

Large O

, O
an O

a O
concert O
on O
the O

were O
organized O

Jews O
had O
to O
participate O

great O
numbers O

All O

stopped O
just O
so O
the O

even O

us O
that O

was O
a O
friend O
of O

that O
in O

Richard B-PERS

father O
suffered O
from O
meningitis O
as O
a O
child O

was O
sickly O
throughout O
his O
life O

He O
was O
a O
professional O
civil O
servant O
of O
the O
Vienna B-LOC
Jewish O
Community O
and O
in O
his O
free O
time O
also O
dealt O
with O
scientific O
and O
mainly O
social O
issues O
. O

The O
mother O
Elsa B-PERS
Engel I-PERS
came O
from O
an O
old O
Viennese B-LOC
Jewish O
family O
, O

was O
the O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS

orphaned O
at O
an O
early O
age O
, O
found O
his O
home O

At O
age O
11 O
, O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
lost O
his O
father O
, O
and O
at O
the O
age O
of O
16 O
his O
mother O
too O
. O

Despite O
his O
unusual O
talent O
, O
he O
decided O
to O
give O
up O
on O
high O
school O
and O
attend O
a O
business O
school O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
care O
of O
himself O
and O
his O
sister O
, O
who O
was O
5 O
years O
younger O
than O
him O
, O
independently O
. O

After O
graduating O
from O
commercial O
school O
, O
he O
worked O
as O
a O
civil O
servant O
in O
several O
private O
companies O
and O
then O
also O
joined O
the O
Jewish O
community O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
as O
a O
professional O
civil O
servant O
at O
the O
age O
of O
21 O

Here O
he O
worked O
according O
to O
the O
regulations O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
in O
various O
departments O
, O
social O

medical O

In O
his O
free O
time O
he O
acquired O
a O
deep O
and O
comprehensive O
knowledge O
, O
mainly O
in O
questions O
of O
history O
and O
national O
economy O

But O
there O
were O
no O
questions O
in O
the O
field O
of O
human O
knowledge O
that O
were O
completely O
alien O
to O
him O
, O
so O
that O
he O
turned O
out O

concise O
personality O
in O
every O
circle O

his O
versatility O
in O
the O
circle O
of O

which O
, O
however O

was O
never O
found O
to O
be O
unpleasant O

his O
humor O

In O
keeping O

he O
was O
a O

was O
organized O

that O
in O
terms O
of O
numbers O
Vienna B-LOC
was O
the O
largest O
aid O
organization O
to O
save O
European B-LOC
Jews O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
determine O
how O
far O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
was O
involved O
in O
the O
planning O
of O
this O
work O
. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
was O
27 O
years O
old O
and O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
officials O
in O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

As O
an O
old O
and O
large O
institution O
, O
the O
Viennese B-LOC
religious O
community O
certainly O
had O
people O
of O
political O
stature O
who O
adjusted O
themselves O
realistically O
to O
the O
given O
situation O
. O

But O
the O
generosity O
of O
the O
whole O
action O
corresponded O
so O
much O
to O
the O
essence O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
. O

That O
he O
was O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
initiators O
of O
the O
planning O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
practical O
implementation O
on O
this O
scale O
and O
at O
this O
speed O
and O
in O
its O
entire O
form O
would O
be O
inconceivable O
without O
him O
is O
completely O
undeniable O
. O

It O
was O
a O
gigantic O
, O
organizational O
, O
technical O
and O
political O
achievement O
that O
was O
accomplished O
in O
that O
year O
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
the O
Jewish O
action O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
started O
immediately O
after O
the O
occupation O
with O
unusual O
violence O
and O
brutality O
. O

In O
the O
first O
days O
homes O
were O
looted O
, O
Jewish O
residents O
tortured O
, O
raped O
and O
driven O
into O
the O
street O
, O
there O
was O
excessive O
panic O
and O
confusion O
and O
in O
this O
situation O
the O
leading O
men O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
were O
put O
in O
prison O
, O
the O
institutions O
of O
the O
Jewish O
community O
blocked O
and O
funds O
confiscated O
. O

The O
leading O
men O
managed O
to O
save O
something O
from O
the O
Nazis O
and O
Emil B-PERS
Engel I-PERS
gave O
this O
first O
illegal O
money O
as O
the O
first O
illegal O
fund O
to O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
before O
his O
arrest O
. O

From O
this O
money O
, O
the O
first O
emergency O
kitchens O
were O
built O
on O
some O
streets O
and O
squares O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
in O
the O
first O
few O
nights O
, O
where O
some O
of O
the O
helpless O
people O
who O
were O
driven O
out O
of O
their O
apartments O
found O
a O
meal O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

In O
the O
night O
and O
in O
the O
fog O
somebody O
brought O
a O
kettle O
, O
somebody O
else O
brought O
a O
sack O
of O
potatoes O
, O
and O
all O
these O
people O
disappeared O
into O
the O
darkness O
of O
the O
night O
. O

But O
this O
wasted O
time O
lasted O
only O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Apparently O
it O
was O
well O
- O
directed O
direction O
that O
the O
Nazis O
used O
to O
give O
the O
Jews O
a O
vivid O
picture O
of O
their O
situation O
and O
their O
entrenchments O
. O

The O
leaders O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
were O
dismissed O
, O
most O
of O
the O
people O
came O
back O
to O
their O
homes O
and O
the O
slogan O
emigration O
was O
officially O
used O
. O

The O
Jews O
had O
actually O
learned O
from O
the O
lesson O
. O

They O
realized O
that O
a O
political O
or O
legal O
fight O
with O
these O
beasts O
outside O
human O
society O
was O
pointless O
and O
that O
at O
the O
moment O
clearing O
the O
battlefield O
was O
the O
only O
option O
. O

The O
entire O
organization O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
was O
put O
at O
the O
service O
of O
this O
work O
at O
that O
moment O
and O
the O
religious O
community O
took O
over O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
action O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
the O
bureaucratic O
process O
for O
the O
emigrants O
was O
simplified O
, O
as O
the O
emigrants O
no O
longer O
had O
to O
visit O
8 O
to O
10 O
different O
offices O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
, O
which O
at O
the O
beginning O
took O
weeks O
to O
months O
, O
but O
the O
matter O
was O
centralized O
. O

Emigration B-ORG
Office I-ORG
: O
from O
each O
authority O
there O
was O
an O
official O
who O
took O
the O
relevant O
document O
for O
processing O
. O

With O
a O
single O
appearance O
, O
churning O
out O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
the O
tax O
office O
, O
police O
certificate O
, O
property O
matters O
and O
everything O
else O
were O
handed O
over O
. O

From O
here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
processing O
by O
the O
individual O
authorities O
began O
, O
which O
was O
no O
longer O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
individual O
, O
but O
by O
the O
officials O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

You O
had O
to O
know O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
his O
physical O
strength O
, O
his O
fanatical O
zeal O
for O
work O
, O
his O
tenacity O
and O
his O
speed O
, O
in O
order O
not O
to O
regard O
the O
description O
of O
his O
work O
performance O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
as O
an O
exaggeration O
. O

Myself O
and O
all O
the O
friends O
from O
Prague B-LOC
who O
later O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
heard O
the O
stories O
of O
its O
population O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
( O
Desider B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
Stricker B-PERS
and O
a. O
) O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
use O
and O
performance O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
recorded O
during O
this O
time O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
there O
are O
probably O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
those O
who O
came O
abroad O
at O
that O
time O
and O
they O
will O
certainly O
remember O
the O
office O
in O
Prinz O
Eugenstrasse O
. O

For O
months O
, O
from O
4 O
am O
and O
usually O
until O
12 O
at O
night O
kilometer O
- O
long O
lines O
of O
men O
stood O
there O
, O
and O
for O
every O
hour O
in O
these O
many O
months O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
was O
at O
his O
place O
or O
the O
staff O
of O
his O
employees O
, O
whom O
he O
brought O
up O
to O
the O
same O
fanaticism O
and O
hard O
work O
and O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
deep O
war O
comradeship O
. O

When O
he O
was O
not O
in O
the O
emigration B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
he O
found O
himself O
in O
ineffable O
contact O
with O
the O
most O
diverse O
authorities O
, O
both O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
civil O
administration O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
, I-LOC
or O
in O
negotiations O
with O
foreign O
authorities O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
obtaining O
visas O
or O
setting O
up O
technical O
travel O
options O
. O

Anyone O
who O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
repatriation O
of O
a O
few O
hundred O
or O
a O
thousand O
people O
to O
their O
homeland O
today O
and O
the O
weeks O
or O
months O
it O
takes O
to O
do O
so O
will O
appreciate O
which O
apparatus O
was O
maintained O
to O
transport O
120,000 O
people O
abroad O
in O
order O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
Nazi O
authorities O
. O

Almost O
every O
single O
case O
required O
fighting O
and O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
with O
the O
civil O
authorities O
regarding O
the O
settlement O
of O
the O
financial O
situation O
, O
required O
concealment O
and O
forgery O
of O
documents O
, O
required O
intervention O
and O
requests O
, O
because O
the O
Nazis O
' O
system O
was O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
designed O
to O
make O
every O
situation O
more O
difficult O
and O
not O
to O
facilitate O
it O
. O

Despite O
all O
the O
horror O
, O
the O
Jews O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
did O
not O
leave O
the O
country O
naked O
and O
poor O
as O
beggars O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
able O
to O
save O
at O
least O
some O
of O
their O
belongings O
for O
their O
new O
home O
. O

Another O
part O
, O
of O
which O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
never O
learned O
anything O
, O
went O
to O
the O
illegal O
funds O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
from O
which O
the O
emigration O
and O
transport O
costs O
were O
paid O
for O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
any O
funds O
themselves O
. O

The O
action O
was O
carried O
out O
as O
generously O
as O
possible O
collectively O
and O
independently O
of O
the O
material O
possibilities O
. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
emigrated O
who O
had O
enough O
initiative O
and O
pushed O
for O
it O
. O

This O
was O
particularly O
true O
and O
that O
is O
the O
most O
positive O
part O
of O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
Vienna B-LOC
community O
, O
for O
all O
those O
people O
- O
and O
there O
were O
thousands O
after O
the O
Grünspan O
affair O
- O
who O
were O
in O
custody O
. O

As O
already O
mentioned O
in O
the O
introduction O
, O
after O
interventions O
and O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
it O
was O
possible O
to O
get O
arrested O
Jews O
out O
of O
the O
concentration O
camps O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
foreign O
visas O
and O
the O
corresponding O
ship O
or O
flight O
tickets O
. O

The O
thousands O
of O
visas O
to O
various O
countries O
around O
the O
world O
, O
such O
as O
Shanghai B-LOC
, O
Chile B-LOC
, O
Fiji B-LOC
, O
etc O
. O

, O
were O
automatically O
issued O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
relatives O
who O
reported O
the O
arrest O
. O

Whole O
ships O
were O
completely O
bought O
up O
for O
weeks O
and O
months O
by O
the O
religious O
community O
for O
the O
transport O
of O
emigrants O
, O
and O
there O
were O
airlines O
that O
were O
also O
occupied O
by O
the O
religious O
community O
for O
weeks O
and O
months O
and O
were O
not O
accessible O
to O
other O
civilians O
. O

And O
then O
the O
Viennese B-LOC
children O
! O
Friedmann B-PERS
later O
said O
that O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
hours O
of O
his O
life O
when O
he O
apparently O
harshly O
and O
brutally O
insisted O
to O
mothers O
of O
infants O
to O
20-year O
- O
olds O
to O
put O
their O
children O
on O
the O
Kindertransport O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

Many O
tears O
were O
shed O
to O
accompany O
these O
only O
saved O
Jewish O
European B-LOC
children O
on O
their O
journey O
into O
life O
. O

He O
himself O
accompanied O
almost O
all O
the O
Kindertransports O
to O
London B-LOC
. O

The O
series O
of O
his O
warm O
and O
humorous O
stories O
and O
anecdotes O
from O
this O
time O
of O
positive O
work O
performance O
included O
the O
stories O
of O
the O
small O
children O
who O
were O
still O
carried O
in O
baskets O
and O
the O
boys O
and O
girls O
in O
adolescence O
who O
participated O
in O
the O
collective O
of O
travel O
and O
the O
romance O
of O
the O
company O
and O
among O
whom O
he O
had O
hundreds O
of O
small O
, O
beloved O
friends O
, O
among O
the O
most O
beautiful O
. O

He O
smuggled O
a O
few O
hundred O
, O
sometimes O
outside O
of O
the O
official O
lists O
, O
a O
few O
times O
he O
was O
imprisoned O
at O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
border O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
or O
a O
few O
days O
, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
unusual O
, O
because O
imprisonment O
and O
mortal O
danger O
were O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
so O
- O
called O
higher O
authority O
the O
daily O
bread O
. O

How O
often O
he O
was O
arrested O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
for O
hours O
or O
for O
days O
he O
did O
not O
know O
himself O
later O
, O
about O
twenty O
times O
. O

The O
negotiations O
were O
by O
no O
means O
always O
carried O
out O
in O
a O
civil O
or O
friendly O
tone O
, O
but O
on O
their O
own O
. O

But O
apart O
from O
all O
these O
ordinary O
emigrants O
and O
those O
from O
the O
concentration O
camps O
and O
the O
Emigration B-ORG
Office I-ORG
Austria B-LOC
who O
left O
officially O
, O
there O
was O
a O
group O
of O
people O
who O
had O
to O
disappear O
without O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
learning O
of O
their O
existence O
. O

These O
went O
illegally O
across O
the O
borders O
and O
the O
execution O
of O
such O
emigration O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
official O
officer O
of O
the O
Office B-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
under O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
Richard B-PERS
Israel I-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
as O
he O
was O
known O
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
was O
illegally O
across O
the O
border O
himself O
a O
few O
times O
, O
because O
his O
principle O
was O
never O
to O
negotiate O
from O
the O
green O
table O
and O
apart O
from O
planning O
and O
organizing O
, O
he O
practically O
participated O
in O
the O
implementation O
himself O
. O

Young O
and O
elderly O
men O
from O
his O
Vienna B-LOC
Guard O
, O
which O
later O
spoke O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
characterized O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
: O
From O
this O
time O
: O
Richard B-PERS
was O
our O
leader O
and O
we O
obeyed O
him O
blindly O
, O
because O
we O
had O
convinced O
us O
that O
everything O
he O
asked O
of O
us O
should O
always O
be O
done O
first O
. O

Psychological O
situation O
At O
this O
point O
I O
would O
like O
to O
raise O
a O
question O
of O
principle O
. O

In O
circles O
of O
the O
general O
public O
who O
had O
no O
insight O
into O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Jewish O
representatives O
, O
and O
even O
more O
so O
in O
circles O
abroad O
who O
did O
not O
know O
life O
directly O
under O
fascist O
terror O
, O
it O
must O
appear O
problematic O
and O
puzzling O
that O
a O
Jew O
is O
de O
facto O
right O
- O
and O
achieved O
success O
in O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
powerless O
, O
even O
in O
the O
highest O
position O
. O

One O
wonders O
, O
rightly O
, O
at O
what O
price O
did O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
make O
concessions O
? O
After O
all O
, O
it O
was O
the O
master O
of O
the O
life O
and O
death O
of O
the O
Jewish O
individual O
, O
or O
why O
did O
it O
allow O
itself O
to O
be O
deceived O
and O
deceived O
for O
months O
and O
sometimes O
years O
? O
For O
us O
, O
who O
have O
seen O
the O
work O
up O
close O
, O
behind O
the O
scenes O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
or O
we O
have O
seen O
the O
Nazi O
rule O
in O
concentration O
camps O
, O
this O
matter O
is O
less O
of O
a O
mystery O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
one O
essential O
fact O
needs O
to O
be O
established O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
Nazi O
henchmen O
, O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
SS O
- O
Unter O
- O
Ober O
- O
Sturmführer O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
were O
dull O
, O
stupid O
, O
uneducated O
, O
incompetent O
creatures O
. O

Their O
only O
obligatory O
ability O
was O
cruelty O
and O
brutality O
and O
enough O
political O
stupidity O
to O
believe O
in O
the O
victory O
of O
the O
gang O
of O
criminals O
of O
which O
they O
were O
the O
beneficiaries O
to O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

The O
blunt O
, O
incompetent O
journeymen O
now O
had O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
so O
- O
called O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
question O
, O
so O
, O
as O
pointless O
as O
the O
matter O
was O
ideologically O
, O
they O
had O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
concrete O
work O
plan O
. O

In O
the O
first O
phase O
it O
was O
the O
emigration O
action O
, O
later O
the O
regulation O
of O
Jewish O
life O
, O
and O
when O
the O
Jews O
fell O
more O
and O
more O
out O
of O
the O
framework O
of O
normal O
state O
life O
through O
sweeping O
legislation O
, O
formed O
a O
kind O
of O
state O
. O

This O
emigration O
campaign O
, O
and O
later O
the O
regulation O
of O
Jewish O
life O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
somehow O
. O

And O
since O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
creatures O
were O
themselves O
incapable O
and O
, O
especially O
later O
, O
were O
unable O
to O
do O
everything O
themselves O
numerically O
, O
they O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
implementation O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
to O
people O
of O
the O
oppressed O
people O
. O

So O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
they O
needed O
people O
who O
were O
superior O
to O
the O
incompetent O
, O
and O
if O
the O
latter O
was O
sufficiently O
intelligent O
to O
see O
through O
their O
inability O
and O
weakness O
behind O
the O
official O
position O
of O
power O
of O
the O
Nazis O
, O
then O
he O
had O
psychologically O
gained O
power O
over O
them O
. O

And O
now O
comes O
the O
most O
essential O
part O
: O
it O
depended O
entirely O
on O
the O
character O
of O
the O
individual O
whether O
he O
used O
this O
power O
for O
his O
or O
her O
advantage O
or O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
community O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
former O
was O
the O
case O
. O

And O
so O
much O
has O
the O
masses O
got O
used O
to O
seeing O
a O
traitor O
or O
weakling O
in O
a O
leader O
of O
an O
oppressed O
ethnic O
group O
that O
the O
few O
really O
strong O
and O
combative O
natures O
are O
easily O
seen O
from O
the O
same O
perspective O
. O

It O
is O
like O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
the O
field O
of O
some O
humanities O
, O
which O
are O
often O
so O
compromised O
by O
false O
prophets O
or O
charlatans O
that O
those O
who O
really O
seek O
the O
truth O
have O
to O
fight O
against O
a O
forest O
of O
prejudices O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
field O
of O
parapsychology O
. O

We O
saw O
the O
same O
thing O
every O
day O
in O
the O
prisons O
and O
concentration O
camps O
. O

It O
was O
always O
people O
who O
organizationally O
or O
for O
example O
, O
particularly O
medically O
gifted O
, O
held O
leading O
positions O
in O
the O
self O
- O
administration O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
was O
the O
kapos O
, O
the O
bloc O
and O
camp O
elders O
, O
who O
exploited O
their O
position O
of O
power O
in O
known O
damaging O
ways O
for O
themselves O
and O
their O
closest O
clique O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
most O
of O
the O
political O
prisoners O
owe O
their O
lives O
to O
the O
great O
illegal O
organization O
which O
had O
people O
of O
special O
talent O
and O
spe- O
cial O
moral O
strength O
in O
leadership O
positions O
and O
which O
put O
their O
position O
entirely O
at O
the O
service O
of O
the O
salvation O
of O
their O
comrades O
. O

wonderful O
way O

He O
describes O
the O
occupation O
in O
Norway B-LOC

describes O
how O
the O
Nazis O
force O
the O
old O
mayor O
of O
the O
city O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
an O
open O
enemy O
of O
their O
system O
and O
makes O
the O
greatest O
difficulties O
in O
carrying O
out O
their O
plans O
, O
to O
remain O
in O
his O
place O
, O
even O
at O
the O
price O
of O
great O
concessions O
. O

You O
need O
him O
because O
he O
masters O
the O
machine O
, O
because O
he O
is O
popular O
and O
enjoys O
the O
trust O
of O
his O
fellow O
citizens O
. O

Because O
that O
was O
another O
diabolical O
moment O
in O
the O
practice O
of O
the O
Nazis O
, O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
exploit O
the O
popularity O
of O
even O
the O
enemy O
, O
but O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
public O
opinion O
was O
still O
there O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
. O

In O
the O
last O
bloody O
years O
they O
dropped O
any O
mask O

at O
that O
time O
they O
really O
only O
needed O

phase O

The O

has O
shaken O
me O
deeply O

it O
portrays O

the O
situation O
of O
the O
Jews O
here O
was O
significantly O
different O
from O
that O
in O
Vienna B-LOC

Most O
of O
the O
Jews O
were O
completely O
absorbed O
in O
the O
life O
of O
the O
entire O
Czech B-LOC
people O
and O
had O
no O
ties O
to O
a O
central O
Jewish O
administrative O
body O

The O
religious O
community O
in O
Prague B-LOC
was O
a O
small O
, O
rather O
unknown O
office O
and O
a O
large O
part O

not O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
was O
assigned O
to O
Prague B-LOC
for O
a O
few O
days O
in O
August B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
as O
an O
advisor O
on O
questions O
relating O
to O
the O
emigration O
campaign O
. O

It O
would O
lead O
too O
far O
to O
carry O
out O
an O
in O
- O
depth O
analysis O
of O
the O
mentality O
of O
Czech B-LOC
Jews O
at O
this O
point O
. O

It O
was O
certainly O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
the O
Jews O
felt O
the O
solidarity O
of O
the O
local O
population O
here O
, O
because O
almost O
the O
entire O
Czech B-LOC
people O
naturally O
saw O
the O
German B-LOC
occupiers O
as O
a O
common O
enemy O
; O
perhaps O
it O
was O
also O
the O
fact O
that O
German B-LOC
fascism O
in O
Prague B-LOC
in O
the O
first O
days O
and O
weeks O
was O
less O
dramatic O
, O
than O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
; O
Probably O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Jews O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
was O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
Viennese B-LOC
, O
most O
of O
them O
had O
lived O
here O
for O
generations O
and O
were O
strongly O
rooted O
, O
while O
most O
of O
the O
Jews O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
had O
hardly O
come O
from O
the O
east O
a O
generation O
ago O
, O
the O
times O
of O
persecution O
were O
still O
vivid O
in O
their O
memories O
and O
they O
were O
therefore O
much O
more O
flexible O
and O
generous O
in O
their O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
. O

Anyway O
, O
it O
was O
the O
case O
that O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
his O
stay O
in O
Prague B-LOC
found O
himself O
in O
a O
completely O
strange O
, O
incomprehensible O
world O
. O

Two O
worlds O
faced O
each O
other O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

In O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
Vienna B-LOC
experience O
and O
the O
Vienna B-LOC
program O
, O
increased O
by O
the O
troubled O
times O
and O
the O
nearness O
of O
the O
impending O
war O
- O
August B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
! O
- O
Friedmann B-PERS
almost O
rushed O
to O
carry O
out O
an O
emigration O
campaign O
in O
order O
to O
transport O
the O
greatest O
possible O
number O
of O
people O
abroad O
in O
the O
shortest O
possible O
time O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
public O
Jewish O
opinion O
and O
accordingly O
their O
representatives O
in O
Prague B-LOC
responded O
with O
the O
greatest O
indolence O
and O
with O
the O
greatest O
displeasure O
, O
most O
of O
them O
spoke O
openly O
that O
they O
were O
convinced O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
would O
not O
proceed O
so O
energetically O
and O
that O
yes O
, O
War O
was O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
that O
it O
would O
only O
be O
a O
matter O
of O
weeks O
until O
the O
Nazis O
were O
destroyed O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
actually O
faced O
this O
mentality O
in O
despair O
and O
at O
a O
loss O
. O

With O
almost O
brutal O
openness O
and O
clarity O
, O
he O
explained O
to O
everyone O
that O
he O
considered O
such O
arguments O
to O
be O
nonsense O
, O
that O
every O
normal O
person O
must O
be O
clear O
about O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
coming O
war O
, O
should O
not O
have O
any O
useless O
illusions O
about O
the O
force O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
war O
machine O
, O
he O
was O
right O
with O
a O
dispute O
years O
ago O
, O
he O
literally O
said O
that O
he O
thought O
7 O
years O
of O
war O
were O
possible O
. O

He O
also O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
people O
what O
German B-LOC
fascism O
was O
capable O
of O
, O
especially O
, O
and O
he O
foresaw O
clearly O
that O
if O
things O
go O
badly O
for O
him O
in O
the O
end O
, O
of O
which O
he O
was O
of O
course O
convinced O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
his O
imagination O
was O
not O
enough O
for O
gas O
chambers O
and O
Treblinky B-CAMP
. O

There O
were O
innumerable O
people O
who O
, O
in O
possession O
of O
an O
opportunity O
to O
emigrate O
, O
came O
to O
ask O
his O
advice O
whether O
it O
would O
stand O
in O
favor O
of O
still O
emigrating O
. O

To O
such O
people O
he O
said O
roughly O
literally O
: O
For O
me O
there O
is O
only O
one O
point O
of O
view O
and O
that O
is O
out O
at O
all O
costs O
. O

They O
are O
attached O
to O
your O
stuff O
, O
your O
apartment O
and O
your O
existence O
and O
, O
in O
the O
best O
case O
scenario O
, O
will O
have O
saved O
your O
life O
by O
the O
end O
of O
this O
war O
. O

During O
this O
time O
you O
probably O
will O
have O
started O
a O
new O
life O
outside O
. O

It O
is O
understandable O
that O
such O
truths O
, O
which O
forced O
people O
to O
give O
up O
their O
rest O
and O
comfort O
, O
were O
not O
felt O
pleasantly O
. O

One O
reacted O
with O
defensiveness O
, O
with O
suspicion O
and O
was O
ultimately O
more O
inclined O
to O
accept O
falsehood O
and O
evil O
will O
from O
the O
preacher O
of O
such O
unpleasant O
truths O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
his O
carelessness O
. O

( O
Incidentally O
, O
this O
sad O
spectacle O
of O
indolence O
has O
been O
repeated O
until O
recently O
, O
after O
all O
very O
few O
believed O
in O
gas O
chambers O
and O
similar O
atrocities O
when O
all O
the O
signs O
indicated O
it O
. O

People O
liked O
to O
lie O
to O
themselves O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
uncomfortable O
truths O
at O
bay O
. O

) O
During O
this O
time O
I O
got O
to O
know O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
and O
I O
have O
to O
describe O
some O
personal O
impressions O
that O
may O
illuminate O
the O
situation O
. O

The O
first O
time O
we O
met O
, O
I O
got O
into O
a O
heated O
argument O
with O
him O
. O

He O
told O
me O
about O
the O
atrocities O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
about O
their O
work O
. O

Fanatical O
hatred O
and O
contempt O
for O
the O
German B-LOC
people O
in O
general O
spoke O
from O
his O
whole O
being O
, O
with O
an O
intensity O
that O
I O
had O
never O
experienced O
before O
and O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
- O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
at O
the O
time O
- O
a O
downright O
morbid O
Jewish O
self O
- O
confidence O
and O
an O
arrogance O
that O
I O
had O
never O
experienced O
before O
. O

In O
my O
attitude O
at O
that O
time O
( O
September B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
) O
I O
was O
outraged O
by O
the O
condemnation O
of O
an O
entire O
people O
like O
the O
Germans B-LOC
and O
on O
my O
part O
stuck O
to O
the O
theory O
of O
the O
criminal O
clique O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
I O
saw O
in O
him O
a O
wild O
Chauvinist O
Jewish O
nationalist O
. O

We O
two O
faced O
each O
other O
as O
two O
worlds O
. O

He O
had O
just O
experienced O
German B-LOC
fascism O
in O
such O
a O
concentrated O
form O
that O
after O
a O
year O
he O
knew O
what O
we O
had O
come O
to O
after O
6 O
years O
. O

When O
I O
spoke O
of O
individual O
criminals O
, O
he O
said O
that O
it O
was O
the O
same O
people O
he O
had O
played O
with O
, O
with O
whom O
he O
went O
to O
school O
and O
who O
were O
sitting O
comfortably O
in O
the O
Prater O
, O
who O
were O
still O
shooting O
at O
cars O
with O
Jews O
in O
them O
who O
had O
already O
been O
arrested O
were O
transported O
to O
the O
prisons O
. O

And O
in O
our O
endless O
debates O
in O
which O
I O
fought O
against O
his O
so O
- O
called O
wild O
chauvinism O
, O
he O
said O
after O
a O
while O
: O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
this O
seems O
exaggerated O
in O
normal O
times O
. O

But O
I O
need O
that O
self O
- O
confidence O
. O

I O
need O
it O
in O
my O
fight O
against O
the O
pressure O
of O
this O
gang O
of O
criminals O
. O

How O
grotesque O
it O
must O
have O
seemed O
to O
me O
and O
the O
little O
joy O
that O
knew O
him O
at O
this O
time O
when O
human O
myopia O
managed O
to O
assert O
he O
drove O
people O
to O
emigrate O
like O
the O
Nazis O
. O

We O
reported O
to O
him O
indignantly O
and O
not O
entirely O
convinced O
ourselves O
, O
we O
advised O
him O
to O
let O
people O
live O
the O
way O
they O
wanted O
to O
be O
about O
the O
pessimism O
that O
dominated O
him O
on O
the O
Jewish O
question O
. O

The O
way O
he O
reacted O
to O
the O
slander O
and O
the O
whole O
situation O
was O
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
impressions O
we O
got O
of O
this O
person O
. O

Maybe O
in O
the O
end O
people O
are O
right O
if O
they O
don't O
want O
to O
emigrate O
, O
maybe O
I'm O
no O
longer O
objective O
and O
have O
a O
Vienneseshock O
, O
but O
I O
can't O
and O
will O
not O
say O
anything O
other O
than O
what O
I'm O
convinced O
of O
. O

And O
if O
they O
resent O
me O
for O
that O
, O
I O
understand O
part O
of O
it O
and O
I O
really O
don't O
care O
- O
I O
can't O
please O
everyone O
at O
this O
time O
- O
and O
for O
me O
there O
has O
long O
been O
only O
one O
authority O
and O
that O
is O
my O
own O
conscience O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
I O
have O
no O
desire O
hotter O
than O
that O
the O
Prague O
Jews O
be O
proved O
right O
and O
that O
even O
their O
children O
and O
children O
's O
children O
tell O
how O
I O
made O
their O
life O
miserable O
then O
he O
often O
added O
with O
a O
laugh O
. O

The O
awareness O
of O
power O
and O
the O
absolute O
fulfillment O
of O
duty O
was O
so O
strong O
that O
it O
was O
actually O
immune O
to O
every O
human O
attack O
and O
every O
pettiness O

Unfortunately O
, O
these O
discussions O
were O
only O
of O
practical O
importance O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

On O
September B-DATE
1 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1939 I-DATE
, O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
and O
the O
possibilities O
for O
emigration O
were O
now O
maximally O
restricted O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
naturally O
tried O
to O
get O
all O
passports O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
that O
did O
not O
have O
an O
English B-LOC
visa O
, O
such O
as O
Italy B-LOC
- O
emigrants O
or O
other O
neutral O
countries O
for O
which O
a O
visa O
was O
not O
required O
. O

Even O
this O
tough O
struggle O
, O
which O
lasted O
for O
days O
, O
only O
brought O
partial O
success O
, O
the O
passports O
were O
confiscated O
, O
marked O
with O
a O
J O
as O
Jewish O
passports O
, O
with O
which O
one O
could O
no O
longer O
enter O
Italy B-LOC
. O

During O
those O
days O
and O
nights O
there O
were O
queues O
of O
people O
outside O
his O
office O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
but O
very O
few O
came O
out O
. O

He O
never O
gave O
up O
trying O
to O
get O
people O
out O
and O
there O
was O
always O
still O
some O
country O
, O
until O
actually O
almost O
the O
whole O
world O
was O
at O
war O
, O
and O
sporadically O
people O
got O
out O
into O
it O

Ms O

Hanna B-PERS
Steiner I-PERS
, O
who O
headed O
the O
emigration O
department O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
occasionally O
characterized O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
attitude O
as O
follows O
: O
If O
the O
whole O
world O
is O
already O
at O
war O
, O
Richard O
will O
calmly O
refer O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
work O
is O
being O
carried O
out O
on O
the O
exploration O
of O
Mars O
. O

I O
think O
he O
will O
never O
give O
in O
. O

Activities O
in O
Prague B-LOC
were O
interrupted O
as O
early O
as O
October B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
, O
due O
to O
an O
episode O
that O
was O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
the O
first O
sign O
of O
the O
later O
catastrophe O
. O

Today O
we O
know O
how O
the O
Jews O
in O
Poland B-LOC
were O
tortured O
and O
murdered O
, O
but O
this O
news O
reached O
Central O
Europe B-LOC
only O
as O
gruesome O
fairy O
tales O
and O
was O
hardly O
believed O
. O

In O
October B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
, O
Jews O
were O
transported O
east O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

A O
so O
- O
called O
workers O
- O
transport O
composed O
only O
of O
men O
was O
dispatched O
to O
Mähr B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrau I-LOC
and O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
and O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
were O
sent O
as O
officials O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

The O
background O
to O
this O
action O
has O
never O
become O
completely O
clear O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
took O
the O
following O
from O
the O
talks O
with O
the O
notorious O
SS O
- O
man O
in O
Jewish O
affairs O
Eichmann B-PERS
: O
he O
presupposed O
that O
regions O
in O
Poland B-LOC
between O
the O
rivers O
Bug O
and O
San O
, O
where O
the O
war O
had O
raged O
, O
were O
depopulated O
and O
as O
the O
border O
between O
the O
German B-LOC
and O
Soviet B-LOC
- O
Union B-LOC
was O
just O
there O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
settle O
the O
Jews O
as O
a O
buffer O
in O
the O
area O
. O

He O
sent O
men O
who O
were O
fit O
to O
work O
to O
build O
barracks O
into O
which O
more O
Jewish O
people O
would O
come O
afterwards O
. O

On O
the O
trip O
to O
Nisko B-LOC
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
physically O
abused O
by O
the O
SS O
- O
man O
Dresel B-PERS
almost O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
first O
days O
and O
nights O
in O
Nisko B-LOC
were O
full O
of O
the O
most O
severe O
hardships O
, O
people O
lived O
in O
the O
woods O
and O
in O
these O
cold O
nights O
in O
the O
snow O
and O
mud O
the O
friendship O
between O
Friedmann B-PERS
and O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
emerged O
, O
which O
lasted O
, O
as O
banal O
it O
sounds O
, O
to O
their O
almost O
simultaneous O
death O
. O

In O
a O
short O
time O
a O
healthy O
collective O
spirit O
prevailed O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
a O
few O
barracks O
were O
built O
and O
the O
doctors O
of O
the O
transport O
bought O
food O
for O
almost O
the O
entire O
community O
through O
their O
work O
from O
the O
surrounding O
peasantry O
. O

R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
succeeded O
in O
persuading O
one O
of O
the O
SS O
- O
men O
on O
watch O
to O
bring O
him O
with O
a O
car O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Lublin B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
first O
major O
office O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
convince O
the O
local O
SS O
- O
leadership O
that O
the O
action O
was O
taken O
under O
false O
pretenses O
, O
that O
the O
area O
local O
is O
not O
depopulated O
, O
and O
that O
on O
the O
contrary O
the O
indigenous O
population O
was O
rebelling O
against O
the O
influx O
of O
new O
people O
because O
their O
own O
existence O
was O
still O
threatened O
after O
the O
damage O
of O
war O
. O

From O
files O
that O
were O
later O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
perhaps O
still O
exist O
today O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
Lublin B-LOC
Gestapo B-ORG
office I-ORG
negotiated O
with O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
one O
can O
probably O
assume O
that O
the O
action O
was O
discontinued O
due O
to O
these O
negotiations O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
men O
concentrated O
there O
went O
across O
the O
border O
to O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
Union B-LOC
, O
part O
later O
came O
back O
to O
the O
protectorate O
. O

Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
was O
the O
first O
to O
come O
back O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
; O
On O
his O
initiative O
, O
a O
request O
was O
officially O
submitted O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
superordinate O
authority O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
in O
which O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
was O
requested O
for O
the O
community O
of O
Prague B-LOC
, O
with O
the O
indication O
that O
his O
cooperation O
in O
Prague B-LOC
was O
more O
urgently O
necessary O
than O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
at O
that O
time O
. O

In O
December B-DATE
1939 I-DATE
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
was O
also O
back O
and O
from O
there O
the O
regular O
activity O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
in O
Prague B-LOC
begins O
. O

The O
type O
of O
activity O
can O
best O
be O
classified O
as O
follows O
: O
External O
representation O
There O
were O
two O
offices O
of O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
that O
dealt O
separately O
with O
the O
Jewish O
question O
. O

The O
first O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Central O
Office O
for O
Jewish O
Emigration O
, O
an O
office O
that O
dealt O
exclusively O
with O
Jews O
, O
etc O
. O

with O
the O
surveillance O
of O
their O
so O
- O
called O
civil O
life O
, O
a O
surveillance O
which O
over O
time O
got O
mixed O
up O
in O
the O
life O
of O
individuals O
down O
to O
the O
smallest O
and O
most O
grotesque O
details O
. O

The O
second O
office O
, O
the O
usual O
notorious O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
which O
filled O
the O
peoples O
with O
fear O
and O
horror O
wherever O
fascism O
had O
set O
its O
footing O
, O
also O
had O
its O
own O
section O
for O
Jews O
. O

This O
department O
arrested O
the O
Jews O
for O
breaking O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
laws O
, O
and O
of O
course O
there O
were O
Jews O
in O
all O
other O
Gestapo B-ORG
departments I-ORG
, O
such O
as O
the O
communist O
department O
, O
the O
department O
for O
sabotage O
and O
others O

) O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
As O
we O
said O
in O
the O
introduction O
, O
emigration O
was O
no O
longer O
feasible O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war O
. O

The O
retention O
of O
the O
name O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
is O
a O
symbol O
of O
the O
mendacious O
and O
clumsy O
practice O
, O
which O
hid O
nothing O
other O
than O
the O
common O
robbery O
of O
goods O
. O

Lies O
and O
cowardly O
hypocrisy O
were O
the O
leitmotif O
of O
everything O
the O
Nazi O
gangs O
did O
, O
but O
they O
disguised O
their O
crudest O
and O
most O
obvious O
crimes O
with O
a O
cloak O
of O
justice O
. O

Although O
emigration O
was O
now O
practically O
impossible O
, O
around O
50 O
people O
were O
summoned O
to O
fill O
out O
the O
so O
- O
called O
portfolios O
every O
day O
and O
the O
grotesque O
spectacle O
took O
place O
that O
these O
masses O
of O
people O
had O
to O
submit O
their O
applications O
for O
emigration O
with O
all O
formalities O
completed O
, O
without O
even O
specifying O
the O
destination O
and O
of O
course O
without O
the O
visa O
. O

This O
ridiculous O
comedy O
was O
carried O
out O
because O
the O
emigrant O
voluntarily O
relinquished O
his O
movable O
and O
immovable O
property O
of O
the O
Central O
Office O
for O
Jewish O
Emigration O
. O

But O
this O
comedy O
had O
another O
purpose O
. O

The O
activities O
of O
a O
horde O
of O
SS O
- O
men O
who O
were O
fatter O
every O
day O
in O
the O
struggle O
against O
the O
enemy O
and O
thus O
removed O
from O
the O
battle O
at O
the O
front O
, O
had O
to O
be O
founded O
. O

Since O
the O
same O
interest O
dominated O
the O
whole O
gang O
up O
to O
Himmler B-PERS
, O
they O
lied O
to O
each O
other O
in O
an O
equally O
grotesque O
manner O
and O
silently O
took O
each O
other O
seriously O
. O

Giant O
statistics O
with O
wonderful O
numbers O
and O
drawings O
migrated O
weekly O
and O
monthly O
about O
the O
emigration O
campaign O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
running O
at O
full O
steam O
, O
and O
at O
regular O
intervals O
a O
broad O
medal O
was O
emblazoned O
on O
the O
heroic O
chest O
of O
Obersturmführer O
Günther B-PERS
and O
his O
employees O
. O

In O
this O
legal O
way O
, O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
first O
acquired O
the O
houses O
, O
then O
later O
through O
special O
laws O
the O
furs O
, O
the O
jewelry O
and O
finally O
the O
dogs O
, O
cats O
and O
songbirds O
( O
that O
's O
no O
joke O
) O
from O
the O
property O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
and O
the O
same O
goes O
for O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Weidmann B-PERS
- O
because O
all O
three O
of O
them O
formed O
an O
absolutely O
inseparable O
unit O
vis O
- O
à O
- O
vis O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
- O
of O
course O
saw O
through O
this O
whole O
ridiculous O
comedy O
and O
never O
left O
the O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
Gestapo O
in O
any O
doubt O
that O
he O
saw O
through O
it O
. O

However O
, O
he O
had O
the O
following O
attitude O
: O
As O
long O
as O
this O
comedy O
related O
to O
the O
material O
goods O
of O
man O
so O
far O
that O
his O
current O
existence O
was O
not O
endangered O
, O
he O
considered O
the O
condition O
as O
bearable O
. O

And O
he O
was O
ready O
to O
play O
down O
the O
comedy O
to O
distract O
from O
the O
action O
. O

He O
considered O
the O
most O
important O
function O
of O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
to O
be O
the O
so O
- O
called O
buffer O
effect O
, O
i.e O
. O

the O
entire O
operation O
and O
above O
all O
the O
entire O
responsibility O
was O
deliberately O
and O
consciously O
concentrated O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
leadership O
towards O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
management O
received O
all O
orders O
directly O
and O
personally O
from O
the O
organs O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
; O
the O
execution O
was O
of O
course O
carried O
out O
collectively O
in O
the O
enormously O
increased O
apparatus O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
but O
the O
management O
was O
again O
solely O
responsible O
for O
the O
result O
. O

R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
strictly O
insisted O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
generally O
did O
not O
know O
who O
was O
doing O
the O
individual O
work O
, O
that O
it O
was O
practically O
not O
supposed O
to O
know O
anyone O
except O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Weidmann B-PERS
, O
and O
above O
all O
that O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
hold O
them O
accountable O
in O
any O
way O
. O

He O
took O
the O
correct O
position O
, O
which O
has O
also O
proven O
itself O
over O
the O
years O
, O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
would O
become O
more O
or O
less O
brutal O
and O
abusive O
towards O
the O
senior O
officials O
for O
every O
stupid O
thing O
about O
which O
there O
was O
daily O
noise O
, O
depending O
on O
their O
mood O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
care O
at O
all O
- O
without O
giving O
up O
serious O
measures O
, O
such O
as O
arrest O
or O
deportation O
, O
which O
could O
be O
the O
case O
with O
a O
lesser O
known O
and O
important O
official O
for O
every O
little O
thing O
. O

In O
all O
these O
years O
it O
never O
happened O
, O
and O
this O
can O
be O
confirmed O
by O
all O
surviving O
employees O
of O
the O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Vienna B-LOC
religious O
communities O
, O
that O
any O
head O
of O
a O
subdivision O
was O
held O
responsible O
for O
his O
work O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
( O
an O
exception O
was O
personalities O
such O
as O
Dr O
. O

Franz B-PERS
Weidmann I-PERS
, O
who O
was O
an O
authority O
even O
for O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
negotiated O
directly O
with O
it O
, O
including O
on O
the O
tragic O
death O
of O
Dr O
. O

Hans B-PERS
Bonn I-PERS
and O
Emil B-PERS
Kafka I-PERS
in O
the O
first O
Heydrich B-PERS
days O
on O
the O
pretext O
that O
their O
department O
had O
sabotaged O
registrations O
. O

They O
were O
arrested O
and O
, O
after O
3 O
weeks O
in O
the O
concentration O
camp O
Mauthausen B-CAMP
, O
killed O
. O

This O
was O
the O
prelude O
to O
the O
grisly O
period O
of O
transport O
. O

) O
I O
have O
already O
partially O
characterized O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
's I-PERS
attitude O
towards O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

He O
was O
quick O
- O
witted O
, O
courageously O
self O
- O
confident O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
fearless O
. O

He O
not O
only O
displayed O
his O
fearlessness O
in O
his O
whole O
demeanor O
, O
but O
literally O
held O
it O
up O
to O
them O
at O
every O
opportunity O
. O

Roughly O
literally O
, O
he O
repeated O
stereotypically O
to O
every O
threat O
: O
You O
can O
no O
longer O
scare O
me O
with O
concentration O
camps O
. O

This O
has O
been O
my O
professional O
risk O
since O
I've O
dealt O
with O
you O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
count O
on O
it O
and O
there O
is O
no O
one O
else O
in O
the O
realm O
of O
your O
power O
for O
whom O
I O
have O
to O
fear O
. O

And O
those O
weren't O
just O
empty O
words O
. O

One O
of O
the O
prerequisites O
for O
his O
calm O
and O
security O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
personally O
was O
really O
fearless O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
one O
in O
Europe B-LOC
to O
fear O
for O
. O

His O
only O
sister O
had O
emigrated O
to O
England B-LOC
in O
1937 B-DATE
. O

In O
his O
humorous O
way O
he O
called O
his O
later O
friendship O
with O
me O
an O
industrial O
accident O
and O
was O
strictly O
careful O
that O
no O
one O
and O
never O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
would O
have O
any O
idea O
that O
he O
had O
personal O
ties O
. O

How O
well O
thought O
- O
out O
and O
consistent O
his O
thinking O
and O
acting O
was O
, O
proves O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
saying O
I O
don't O
need O
hostages O
is O
reflected O
in O
the O
incredible O
fact O
of O
my O
existence O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
person O
from O
this O
circle O
who O
survived O
and O
this O
cannot O
be O
explained O
otherwise O
than O
that O
his O
complete O
independence O
was O
so O
well O
known O
and O
so O
often O
blatantly O
emphasized O
that O
ultimately O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
the O
death O
sentence O
was O
issued O
only O
to O
him O
and O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
official O
mold O
, O
which O
was O
carried O
out O
strictly O
, O
it O
stayed O
that O
way O
even O
though O
I O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
on O
the O
same O
transport O
. O

It O
was O
fundamental O
that O
the O
pressure O
that O
was O
so O
concentrated O
on O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
was O
actually O
absorbed O
by O
it O
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
and O
fundamental O
principles O
of O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
that O
he O
carried O
out O
strictly O
and O
in O
an O
ideal O
manner O
and O
that O
he O
also O
required O
the O
entire O
circle O
of O
employees O
never O
push O
down O
. O

He O
worked O
tirelessly O
himself O
, O
if O
it O
was O
necessary O
, O
he O
knew O
neither O
day O
nor O
night O
and O
every O
employee O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
in O
Prague B-LOC
knows O
that O
in O
most O
cases O
he O
did O
not O
leave O
the O
office O
before O
midnight O
, O
especially O
when O
people O
were O
waiting O
for O
him O
to O
give O
him O
their O
little O
and O
great O
worries O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
he O
often O
demanded O
increased O
work O
performance O
from O
some O
departments O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
the O
invitation O
to O
this O
work O
was O
made O
in O
the O
most O
amicable O
, O
comradely O
manner O
and O
above O
all O
in O
absolute O
terms O
and O
the O
employees O
worked O
and O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
never O
weighed O
on O
the O
individual O
official O
. O

Countless O
cases O
are O
known O
in O
which O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
with O
the O
usual O
threats O
of O
imprisonment O
and O
manslaughter O
, O
demanded O
some O
kind O
of O
report O
or O
statistics O
in O
a O
ridiculously O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O

It O
was O
always O
Friedmann B-PERS
personally O
, O
resp O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Weidmann B-PERS
, O
who O
at O
every O
hour O
resp O
. O

every O
day O
fought O
for O
the O
extension O
of O
the O
deadline O
personally O
, O
often O
under O
the O
most O
dramatic O
circumstances O
( O
shouting O
and O
constant O
threats O
with O
arrest O
were O
the O
least O
and O
actually O
made O
no O
further O
impression O
) O
and O
a O
work O
colleague O
was O
never O
allowed O
to O
hear O
the O
saying O
if O
it O
is O
not O
finished O
at O
this O
time O
, O
we O
will O
held O
accountable O
. O

Negotiations O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
responsibility O
towards O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
were O
strictly O
and O
in O
principle O
only O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
senior O
officials O
. O

His O
cordial O
and O
comradely O
relationship O
with O
every O
employee O
was O
literally O
from O
the O
porter O
to O
the O
operator O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
very O
difficult O
existence O
with O
three O
telephones O
always O
working O
in O
his O
office O
. O

His O
whole O
being O
was O
cordial O
, O
humorous O
and O
warm O
, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
training O
and O
strict O
self O
- O
education O
that O
was O
expressed O
in O
his O
relationship O
with O
the O
employees O
. O

He O
repeated O
again O
and O
again O
among O
his O
friends O
and O
colleagues O
: O
We O
, O
who O
have O
to O
do O
with O
the O
Gestapo O
gang O
, O
have O
to O
be O
particularly O
careful O
so O
as O
not O
, O
perhaps O
unconsciously O
, O
to O
use O
even O
the O
slightest O
form O
of O
the O
too O
comfortable O
methods O
of O
the O
master O
people O
against O
a O
subordinate O
. O

And O
above O
all O
- O
and O
he O
emphasized O
this O
again O
and O
again O
- O
one O
of O
our O
employees O
must O
never O
hear O
a O
threat O
from O
the O
Gestapo O
from O
our O
mouth O
. O

Specific O
scope O
of O
duties O
As O
I O
already O
mentioned O
, O
over O
time O
the O
entire O
life O
of O
the O
Jews O
fell O
out O
of O
the O
normal O
framework O
and O
the O
administration O
and O
regulation O
of O
life O
was O
taken O
care O
of O
by O
the O
religious O
community O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
state O
within O
the O
state O
. O

Financing O
the O
large O
masses O
of O
the O
dispossessed O
, O
housing O
issues O
, O
schools O
, O
hospitals O
and O
medical O
services O
, O
travel O
within O
the O
country O
, O
later O
even O
the O
trip O
with O
the O
electric O
car O
and O
a O
thousand O
other O
little O
things O
were O
directly O
subordinate O
to O
the O
administrative O
apparatus O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
every O
single O
regulation O
had O
the O
purpose O
of O
making O
life O
as O
unbearable O
as O
possible O
and O
it O
was O
now O
the O
task O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
situation O
and O
this O
was O
of O
course O
only O
through O
constantly O
and O
systematically O
going O
around O
the O
SS B-ORG
authorities O
. O

Social O
care O
One O
of O
the O
most O
important O
duties O
was O
to O
fight O
for O
the O
budget O
. O

From O
the O
confiscated O
money O
of O
the O
Jewish O
property O
the O
Zentralstelle O
received O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
the O
apparatus O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
but O
of O
course O
that O
was O
a O
variable O
sum O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
changed O
circumstances O
. O

The O
religious O
community O
had O
to O
justify O
what O
it O
needed O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
mentioned O
that O
there O
have O
been O
bitter O
fights O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
over O
every O
single O
post O
over O
the O
years O
. O

It O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
the O
Gestapo O
must O
have O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
money O
is O
needed O
for O
the O
management O
of O
the O
departments O
working O
for O
them O
, O
such O
as O
statistics O
, O
drawing O
rooms O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
and O
that O
the O
social O
welfare O
of O
the O
Jewish O
people O
was O
the O
last O
priority O
. O

Dr O

Franz B-PERS
Weidmann I-PERS
was O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
the O
finance O
minister O
in O
this O
eerie O
state O
and O
was O
a O
master O
at O
camouflaging O
and O
falsifying O
every O
publishing O
house O
to O
the O
greatest O
possible O
extent O
. O

The O
fight O
for O
money O
, O
which O
was O
mostly O
like O
a O
horse O
trade O
, O
was O
then O
jointly O
led O
by O
Dr O
. O

Franz B-PERS
Weidmann I-PERS
with O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
resp O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Weidmann B-PERS
carried O
out O
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
often O
- O
told O
memories O
of O
those O
named O
how O
they O
had O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
for O
the O
first O
Kč O
10,000 O
in O
1939 B-DATE
, O
while O
the O
budget O
later O
amounted O
to O
many O
millions O
. O

The O
social O
welfare O
was O
well O
developed O
for O
the O
given O
circumstances O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
people O

kitchen O
, O
which O
was O
initially O
miserable O
, O
was O
better O
in O
1940 B-DATE
and O
1941 B-DATE
than O
the O
so O
- O
called O
middle O
- O
class O
kitchen O
, O
which O
was O
set O
up O
for O
civil O
servants O
and O
payers O
, O
because O
you O
only O
got O
meals O
for O
ration O
cards O
at O
the O
latter O
, O
while O
the O
people O
's O
kitchen O
as O
an O
institution O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
had O
its O
own O
allocations O
, O
officially O
from O
facilities O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
such O
as O
vegetable O
gardens O

the O

of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
authorities O
and O
good O
relations O
with O

Franz B-PERS
Weidmanns I-PERS
to O
the O
same O
, O
this O
succeeded O
after O
skillful O
intervention O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
in O
that O
it O
was O
made O
clear O
that O
this O
relieved O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
fund O
, O
to O
obtain O
the O
approval O
that O
some O
socially O
supported O
Jews O
from O

to O
Kč O
1,500 O
a O

. O

School O
system O
One O
of O
the O
greatest O
achievements O
was O
camouflaging O
the O
entire O
school O
system O
. O

According O
to O
a O
regulation O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities O
, O
Jewish O
children O
were O
excluded O
from O
all O
public O
schools O
and O
Jewish O
schools O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
open O
. O

Under O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
department O
for O
retraining O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
emigration O
, O
thousands O
of O
children O
and O
young O
people O
received O
some O
practical O
but O
also O
theoretical O
training O
according O
to O
their O
age O
. O

Prof O

Maxmilian B-PERS
Adler I-PERS
, O
of O
whom O
it O
was O
always O
known O
in O
internal O
circles O
that O
he O
was O
actually O
the O
director O
of O
the O
school O
at O
all O
times O
- O
he O
was O
responsible O
for O
regulating O
the O
lessons O
for O
several O
thousand O
children O
- O
organized O
and O
supervised O
the O
teaching O
in O
an O
excellent O
and O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
manner O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
as O
for O
everything O
else O
, O
the O
responsibility O
for O
this O
large O
- O
scale O
fraud O
was O
borne O
by O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

Health O
care O
The O
Jews O
were O
excluded O
from O
all O
public O
sanatoriums O
, O
the O
religious O
community O
received O
its O
own O
hospitals O
, O
its O
own O
outpatient O
departments O
and O
its O
own O
medical O
service O
for O
poor O
patients O
. O

Almost O
all O
Jewish O
doctors O
were O
built O
into O
the O
health O
system O
; O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
of O
course O
never O
allowed O
to O
gain O
proper O
insight O
into O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
supply O
of O
medicines O
. O

Travel O
permits O
It O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
every O
travel O
permit O
for O
every O
single O
individual O
had O
to O
be O
fought O
for O
under O
a O
false O
title O
and O
even O
then O
acquired O
with O
tiring O
interventions O
. O

When O
electrics O
were O
banned O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
only O
sick O
people O
or O
those O
employed O
in O
the O
religious O
community O
were O
allowed O
to O
receive O
ID O
cards O
after O
intervention O
. O

With O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
authorities O
, O
who O
were O
ready O
to O
help O
in O
any O
situation O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
turn O
the O
ban O
into O
a O
farce O
. O

The O
humorous O
Prague B-LOC
tram O
conductors O
said O
that O
never O
were O
so O
many O
Jews O
in O
the O
electric O
tram O
as O
after O
the O
ban O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
population O
was O
now O
sick O
and O
thousands O
more O
were O
doing O
occasional O
temporary O
work O
. O

This O
is O
what O
the O
company O
looked O
like O
from O
the O
inside O
, O
of O
course O
, O
as O
Friedmann B-PERS
put O
it O
, O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
it O
presented O
itself O
as O
a O
policy O
of O
the O
lesser O
evil O
. O

With O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
whole O
personality O
and O
in O
constant O
grueling O
petty O
struggle O
it O
was O
of O
course O
possible O
to O
create O
general O
and O
personal O
relief O
. O

And O
yet O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
life O
- O
it O
doesn't O
need O
to O
be O
specifically O
said O
- O
that O
people O
led O
during O
this O
time O
, O
they O
just O
didn't O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
behind O
the O
scenes O
and O
that O
life O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
than O
it O
was O
around O
that O
time O
already O
. O

A O
small O
example O
to O
illustrate O
the O
situation O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
situations O
for O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
towards O
the O
population O
whose O
interests O
it O
represented O
, O
was O
the O
time O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
house O
action O
. O

On O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
real O
estate O
property O
had O
to O
be O
transferred O
in O
some O
legal O
form O
to O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
. O

R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
basically O
had O
no O
understanding O
of O
the O
tragedy O
of O
this O
action O
, O
he O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
ridiculous O
farce O
, O
he O
said O
literally O
that O
of O
all O
the O
goods O
that O
the O
Nazis O
destroyed O
, O
they O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
carry O
away O
the O
houses O
and O
properties O
and O
that O
every O
signature O
- O
and O
every O
contact O
would O
be O
invalid O
, O
that O
had O
to O
be O
obvious O
to O
every O
normal O
person O
. O

True O
to O
the O
principle O
of O
restricting O
any O
direct O
contact O
between O
the O
civilian O
population O
and O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
as O
possible O
, O
the O
community O
invited O
people O
to O
go O
through O
the O
formalities O
here O
. O

Most O
took O
the O
matter O
disproportionately O
tragically O
, O
as O
the O
formal O
loss O
of O
the O
house O
seemed O
to O
them O
the O
collapse O
of O
their O
existence O
. O

( O
Even O
a O
government O
minister O
, O
who O
has O
been O
returned O
to O
his O
home O
, O
made O
a O
tragedy O
out O
of O
the O
matter O
) O
. O

How O
difficult O
was O
it O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
to O
bring O
someone O
else O
's O
point O
of O
view O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
how O
impossible O
it O
was O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
the O
person O
concerned O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
would O
not O
shy O
away O
from O
classifying O
delay O
as O
sabotage O
or O
acts O
hostile O
to O
the O
state O
. O

This O
fact O
could O
not O
even O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
lips O
, O
because O
no O
matter O
how O
carefully O
it O
was O
phrased O
, O
it O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
indirect O
threat O
that O
was O
expressed O
with O
it O
. O

It O
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
phenomenon O
that O
the O
man O
on O
the O
street O
often O
does O
not O
recognize O
the O
real O
cause O
, O
but O
sees O

with O

this O
difficult O

However O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
considered O
his O
most O
difficult O
and O
most O
important O
duty O
to O
the O
community O
to O
be O
his O
function O
as O
lawyer O
in O
so O
- O
called O
criminal O
cases O
vis O
- O
à O
- O
vis O
the O
political O
secret O
state O
police O
. O

In O
the O
first O
weeks O
after O
the O
occupation O
Edelstein B-PERS
concerned O
himself O
with O
this O
office O
, O
but O
over O
time O
it O
passed O
completely O
into O
the O
work O
area O
of O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
. O

Without O
any O
official O
purview O
, O
even O
without O
the O
official O
title O
of O
a O
lawyer O
, O
solely O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
authority O
that O
was O
instilled O
in O
his O
person O
, O
he O
earned O
the O
trust O
of O
the O
entire O
public O
as O
the O
most O
successful O
lawyer O
and O
- O
as O
paradoxical O
as O
it O
sounds O
- O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
Beasts O
in O
human O
form O
who O
held O
office O
as O
so O
- O
called O
commissioners O
. O

In O
this O
role O
of O
the O
lawyer O
he O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
out O
his O
strong O
positive O
qualities O
most O
openly O
. O

He O
enforced O
respect O
through O
his O
quick O
- O
wittedness O
, O
his O
mind O
and O
skillful O
handling O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
legislation O
. O

He O
impressed O
with O
his O
courage O
and O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
bluffed O
with O
his O
proud O
and O
rather O
superior O
demeanor O
. O

However O
, O
what O
made O
his O
situation O
particularly O
favorable O
and O
what O
made O
him O
superior O
to O
all O
professional O
lawyers O
of O
that O
time O
was O
the O
character O
of O
his O
personal O
lack O
of O
interest O
, O
plus O
his O
proverbial O
and O
even O
grotesquely O
increased O
incorruptibility O
. O

While O
every O
professional O
attorney O
ran O
his O
office O
as O
a O
business O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
known O
to O
appear O
solely O
as O
a O
completely O
disinterested O
representative O
of O
his O
community O
and O
so O
he O
could O
appeal O
again O
and O
again O
without O
loss O
of O
prestige O
after O
each O
rejection O
, O
it O
never O
was O
something O
personal O
and O
never O
something O
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
benefit O
himself O
, O
that O
he O
fought O
for O
. O

His O
incorruptibility O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
characteristic O
traits O
of O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
. O

It O
was O
carried O
out O
so O
extremely O
that O
, O
as O
I O
said O
- O
it O
seemed O
grotesque O
under O
normal O
circumstances O
. O

He O
was O
a O
better O
judge O
of O
people O
than O
any O
of O
us O
and O
knew O
that O
all O
things O
had O
to O
be O
done O
in O
a O
particularly O
clumsy O
and O
downright O
tasteless O
manner O
in O
order O
to O
be O
grasped O
by O
the O
Nazi O
creatures O
. O

It O
was O
known O
that O
he O
would O
not O
accept O
cigarettes O
from O
the O
people O
who O
sought O
his O
help O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
old O
acquaintances O
, O
and O
over O
the O
years O
every O
candy O
bar O
and O
every O
bottle O
of O
liqueur O
that O
was O
sent O
to O
him O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
holidays O
or O
other O
occasions O
was O
forwarded O
with O
innumerable O
receipts O
, O
such O
as O
letters O
of O
thanks O
to O
the O
donor O
to O
the O
hospitals O
, O
orphanages O
and O
old O
people O
's O
homes O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

His O
usual O
formula O
was O
: O
I O
hope O
to O
have O
acted O
in O
your O
favor O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
etc O
. O

But O
in O
the O
area O
of O
​​representation O
in O
so O
- O
called O
criminal O
matters O
, O
the O
results O
actually O
achieved O
were O
unfortunately O
always O
lower O
and O
lower O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
get O
the O
people O
out O
of O
the O
prisons O
who O
were O
in O
custody O
for O
violating O
the O
direct O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

It O
was O
possible O
, O
especially O
later O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transport O
, O
for O
Jews O
to O
be O
arrested O
and O
held O
in O
the O
ghetto B-GHETTO
Theresienstadt I-GHETTO
rather O
than O
sent O
to O
a O
concentration O
camp O
which O
looked O
at O
the O
time O
like O
a O
great O
opportunity O
; O
little O
did O
one O
know O
that O
this O
path O
would O
also O
ultimately O
lead O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
albeit O
years O
later O
. O

As O
for O
the O
political O
prisoners O
, O
for O
whom O
Friedmann B-PERS
exposed O
himself O
in O
an O
almost O
indescribable O
way O
, O
an O
effective O
liberation O
could O
unfortunately O
not O
be O
achieved O
, O
since O
these O
cases O
were O
not O
dealt O
with O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
but O
mostly O
by O
higher O
authorities O
. O

The O
local O
Gestapo B-ORG
only O
handled O
the O
case O
. O

How O
much O
unspeakable O
agony O
and O
horror O
was O
hidden O
behind O
this O
word O
, O
will O
hopefully O
have O
been O
made O
known O
to O
all O
people O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
today O
. O

What O
he O
achieved O
was O
at O
most O
exchange O
of O
messages O
and O
, O
at O
best O
, O
arranging O
visits O
of O
the O
next O
of O
kin O
, O
but O
what O
that O
meant O
in O
this O
situation O
can O
only O
be O
measured O
by O
those O
who O
experienced O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
prison O
. O

His O
greatest O
merit O
in O
this O
area O
, O
however O
, O
was O
the O
following O
, O
and O
if O
this O
means O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
abstract O
term O
for O
those O
who O
are O
far O
away O
, O
those O
who O
have O
experienced O
the O
situation O
knew O
how O
to O
appreciate O
it O
and O
for O
it O
they O
had O
the O
deepest O
gratitude O
to O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
. O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
was O
for O
all O
those O
who O
had O
suffered O
the O
greatest O
misfortune O
of O
that O
time O
, O
that O
they O
knew O
their O
loved O
ones O
in O
Gestapo O
custody O
, O
a O
safe O
and O
stable O
entity O
in O
whom O
they O
placed O
all O
their O
worry O
and O
the O
whole O
burden O
of O
the O
situation O
and O
with O
whom O
they O
were O
convinced O
that O
they O
were O
in O
the O
very O
best O
of O
hands O
. O

Every O
individual O
, O
who O
, O
even O
after O
waiting O
hours O
and O
days O
, O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
personally O
under O
all O
circumstances O
, O
had O
the O
secure O
feeling O
when O
he O
left O
him O
that O
he O
had O
done O
everything O
humanly O
possible O
for O
his O
neighbor O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
. O

He O
had O
a O
wonderfully O
warm O
and O
humanely O
close O
relationship O
with O
all O
these O
people O
in O
need O
, O
an O
incredible O
calm O
and O
unwavering O
patience O
. O

Especially O
for O
such O
cases O
, O
which O
in O
their O
desperation O
often O
immediately O
sought O
advice O
and O
help O
, O
he O
could O
be O
reached O
by O
telephone O
over O
the O
years O
without O
exception O
, O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Something O
else O
added O
to O
the O
special O
confidence O
he O
enjoyed O
in O
these O
matters O
. O

He O
never O
made O
empty O
promises O
; O
in O
a O
humanely O
compassionate O
way O
he O
was O
also O
able O
to O
convey O
cruel O
truths O
, O
if O
they O
were O
unchangeable O
, O
and O
when O
he O
did O
communicate O
something O
joyful O
, O
one O
had O
unlimited O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O

He O
just O
had O
, O
as O
he O
called O
it O
, O
the O
courage O
to O
be O
unpopular O
, O
which O
ultimately O
proved O
to O
be O
the O
source O
of O
great O
popularity O
. O

A O
few O
examples O
to O
illustrate O
the O
work O
. O

In O
1940 B-DATE
, O
when O
normal O
emigration O
was O
almost O
impossible O
, O
there O
was O
a O
Slovak B-LOC
consul O
in O
Prague B-LOC
who O
was O
bribed O
and O
issued O
visas O
to O
Jews O
without O
the O
necessary O
authorization O
from O
the O
higher O
authorities O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
never O
conducted O
such O
negotiations O
himself O
, O
he O
was O
too O
well O
known O
and O
exposed O
, O
but O
he O
found O
a O
man O
who O
knew O
the O
consul O
and O
negotiated O
with O
him O
( O
Hajek B-PERS
) O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
got O
some O
of O
the O
money O
for O
the O
visa O
, O
negotiated O
with O
him O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
people O
and O
concerned O
himself O
with O
the O
emigration O
permit O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
while O
somehow O
cleverly O
disguising O
the O
origin O
and O
the O
type O
of O
visa O
. O

One O
day O
the O
story O
was O
blurted O
out O
at O
the O
consulate O
, O
both O
the O
consul O
and O
Mr O
. O

Hajek B-PERS
were O
arrested O
. O

The O
narrowest O
circles O
around O
Friedmann B-PERS
were O
justifiably O
nervous O
and O
it O
was O
expected O
with O
certainty O
that O
he O
would O
also O
be O
arrested O
the O
next O
day O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
Friedmann B-PERS
did O
the O
most O
daring O
thing O
he O
could O
do O
; O
the O
next O
day O
he O
went O
to O
the O
commissioner O
of O
the O
Jewish O
department O
for O
Hajek B-PERS
apparently O
calmly O
to O
intervene O
, O
but O
counted O
himself O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
stay O
there O
right O
away O
. O

Hajek B-PERS
did O
well O
, O
didn't O
tell O
anyone O
, O
the O
consul O
was O
deported O
to O
Slovakia B-LOC
and O
Hajek B-PERS
was O
free O
after O
about O
6 O
weeks O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS

for O

Tirelessly O

how O

The O
doctor O

leading O

in O
the O
White O

One O
day O
in O
April B-DATE
1941 I-DATE
when O
Friedmann B-PERS
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
were O
in O
Holland B-LOC
, O
Dr O

Salomon B-PERS
Lieben I-PERS
was O
arrested O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
Jewish O
population O
, O
but O
almost O
the O
entire O
city O
was O
appalled O
. O

When O
Friedmann B-PERS
came O
from O
Holland B-LOC
, O
Dr O
. O

Lieben B-PERS
was O
transferred O
from O
the O
Prague B-LOC

camp O
Small O
Fortress O
near O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
his O
file O
was O
passed O
on O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

The O
motive O
for O
the O
arrest O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
grotesque O
that O
had O
ever O
occurred O
. O

In O
the O
years O
before O
the O
occupation O
of O
Prague B-LOC
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
some O
people O
collected O
money O
Black O

which O
had O
been O
founded O
by O
Strasser B-PERS
, O
at O
first O
a O
friend O

of O

who O
later O
came O
to O
dispute O
with O

, O
basically O
apolitical O

without O

a O
small O
sum O
like O
thousands O
of O

came O
to O
the O

In O
1941 B-DATE
a O

a O
second O
Jew O
from O

So O
these O
two O

were O
grotesquely O
charged O
with O
having O
ties O
to O
the O
Black O
Front O
group O
. O

Richard B-PERS

a O
tough O
, O

grueling O
battle O
over O
the O
person O
of O

Salomon B-PERS

He O
was O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
every O
day O
, O
fought O
with O
all O
the O
arguments O
available O
, O
described O
the O
type O
of O
Dr O

, O
which O
would O
remain O
historical O
, O
described O
the O
impression O
on O
public O
opinion O

. O

He O
described O
Dr O

Lieben B-PERS
as O
the O
type O
of O
absolutely O
apolitical O
, O
pure O
philanthropist O
who O
, O
as O
he O
told O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
would O
donate O
for O
a O
collection O
for O
orphanedHitlerchildren O
as O
for O
Jewish O
orphans O
. O

The O
commissioner O
sent O
additional O
reports O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
which O
he O
assessed O
the O
situation O
for O
Dr O

Liebens B-PERS
and O
tried O
to O
make O
it O
more O
favorable O

But O
one O
day O
the O
decision O
came O
- O
as O
in O
all O
cases O
at O
this O
time O
- O
negative O
. O

Dr O

Lieben B-PERS
should O
be O
sent O
on O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
succeeded O
in O
influencing O
the O
Commissioner O
so O
strongly O
that O
he O
did O
something O
that O
was O
unique O
in O
the O
mentality O
and O
practice O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

These O
creatures O
, O
as O
courageous O
and O
heroic O
as O
they O
behaved O
towards O
the O
defenseless O
prisoners O
, O
are O
cowardly O
, O
willless O
and O
blind O
tools O
of O
every O
organ O
higher O
than O
them O
. O

None O
of O
them O
ever O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
expose O
themselves O
to O
their O
superiors O
for O
a O
prisoner O
and O
especially O
a O
Jew O
, O
even O
if O
he O
would O
sometimes O
have O
done O
it O
personally O
. O

That O
was O
the O
diabolical O
thing O
about O
this O
system O
, O
that O
the O
criminals O
sat O
anonymously O
at O
the O
top O
and O
that O
such O
a O
murderer O
had O
a O
whole O
staff O
of O
blind O
executive O
organs O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
Friedmann B-PERS
forced O
the O
Prague B-LOC
inspector O
to O
send O
the O
decision O
back O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
demand O
a O
revision O
of O
the O
judgment O

justify O
that O
a O

. O

Hirsch B-PERS
and O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
the O
transport O
. O

You O
knew O
what O
that O
meant O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Ing O
. O

Hirsch B-PERS
went O
alone O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
Dr O
. O

Lieben B-PERS
stayed O
in O
his O
place O
. O

In O
a O
black O
letter O
to O
his O
relatives O
, O
Dr O
. O

Liebens B-PERS
assessed O
the O
situation O
and O
wrote O
literally O
: O
Either O
a O
miracle O
has O
happened O
for O
me O
or O
I O
have O
a O
powerful O
protector O
. O

One O
took O
a O
deep O
breath O
and O
was O
happy O
about O
the O
current O
success O
. O

But O
the O
days O
of O
tension O
that O
Friedmann B-PERS
experienced O
until O
the O
response O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
arrived O
cannot O
be O
described O
. O

The O
decision O
came O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

Dr O
. O

Lieben B-PERS
would O
not O
have O
been O
declared O
guilty O
, O
he O
was O
innocent O
and O
therefore O
only O
in O
protective O
custody O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
. O

Berlin B-LOC
had O
decided O
. O

Dr O
. O

Sal B-PERS
. I-PERS

Lieben I-PERS
was O
sent O
to O
the O
Dachau B-CAMP
concentration O
camp B-CAMP
. O

After O
several O
months O
, O
a O
telegram O
arrived O
with O
the O
news O
of O
his O
death O
of O
a O
stomach O
- O
and O
intestinal O
catarrh O
. O

Another O
instructive O
case O
was O
the O
following O
: O
A O
young O
communist O
( O
Helene B-PERS
Fantl I-PERS
) O
was O
pregnant O
at O
the O
time O
of O
arrest O
in O
1940 B-DATE
. O

She O
was O
temporarily O
released O
from O
the O
concentration O
camp O
Ravensbrueck B-CAMP
for O
the O
birth O
of O
the O
child O
and O
should O
return O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
after O
a O
few O
months O
. O

She O
could O
not O
flee O
herself O
, O
as O
this O
would O
have O
endangered O
her O
relatives O
as O
well O
as O
perhaps O
friends O
who O
had O
taken O
care O
of O
the O
child O
, O
the O
terror O
at O
this O
time O
was O
too O
great O
for O
a O
whole O
family O
to O
go O
into O
illegality O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
to O
choose O
the O
lesser O
of O
two O
evils O
and O
ensured O
that O
the O
woman O
and O
her O
children O
were O
not O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
, O
but O
to O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
, O
which O
was O
already O
in O
existence O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
intervened O
in O
this O
regard O
with O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
. O

The O
commissioner O
originally O
refused O
because O
it O
would O
be O
against O
his O
rules O
, O
but O
after O
further O
negotiations O
he O
agreed O
to O
overlook O
the O
matter O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
if O
she O
were O
accidentally O
added O
to O
the O
transport O
. O

But O
his O
condition O
was O
that O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
that O
put O
together O
the O
transports O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
facts O
. O

( O
The O
various O
offices O
of O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
were O
mostly O
opposed O
to O
each O
other O
as O
hostile O
groups O
, O
because O
they O
always O
lived O
in O
paranoia O
that O
the O
others O
had O
more O
loot O
) O
. O

At O
this O
time O
there O
were O
transports O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
at O
short O
intervals O
and O
people O
waited O
in O
fear O
that O
Helene B-PERS
F. I-PERS
would O
be O
added O
to O
the O
line O
. O

It O
was O
a O
treacherous O
coincidence O
that O
she O
was O
not O
on O
any O
transports O
. O

The O
date O
of O
their O
return O
to O
the O
concentration O
camps O
came O
closer O
and O
closer O
, O
the O
Commissioner O
promised O
that O
he O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
, O
but O
one O
day O
- O
to O
the O
horror O
of O
everyone O
involved O
- O
she O
was O
fetched O
from O
the O
apartment O
at O
night O
and O
transported O
to O
the O
Small B-CAMP
Fortress I-CAMP
. O

And O
this O
time O
, O
too O
, O
something O
unusual O
and O
unique O
succeeded O
. O

After O
the O
intervention O
the O
next O
day O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
a O
particularly O
zealous O
sub O
- O
official O
had O
sent O
them O
. O

Helene B-PERS
F. I-PERS
was O
brought O
back O
from O
the O
fortress B-CAMP
that O
same O
day O
. O

To O
accelerate O
her O
addition O
to O
the O
transport O
, O
SS O
- O
man O
Bartels B-PERS
who O
will O
still O
be O
discussed O
, O
was O
the O
only O
one O
willing O
to O
help O
and O
was O
brought O
into O
her O
confidence O
to O
have O
her O
transferred O
into O
the O
transport O
. O

She O
lived O
with O
her O
children O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
until O
the O
big O
liquidation O
in O
autumn O
1944 B-DATE
. O

In O
October B-DATE
, O
like O
all O
mothers O
, O
she O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
gas O
chamber O
with O
her O
children O
. O

I O
want O
to O
mention O
yet O
the O
cases O
that O
were O
released O
from O
prison O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
medical O
reports O
and O
placed O
, O
on O
personal O
responsibility O
of O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
in O
sick O
- O
institutions O
of O
the O
Jewish O
community O
, O
where O
they O
were O
housed O
and O
from O
which O
most O
came O
back O
to O
freedom O
. O

On O
the O
occasion O
of O
one O
of O
the O
first O
of O
these O
cases O
, O
the O
following O
conversation O
developed O
: O
Who O
is O
liable O
to O
me O
that O
the O
Jewess O
does O
not O
disappear O
. O

I O
am O
personally O
liable O
to O
you O
. O

You O
risk O
your O
head O
, O
you O
are O
a O
bit O
reckless O
, O
Friedmann O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
replied O
with O
a O
laugh O
. O

Until O
people O
are O
interested O
in O
my O
head O
, O
the O
reason O
will O
be O
found O
, O
for O
the O
time O
being O
it O
is O
not O
that O
far O
. O

From O
today O
's O
perspective O
, O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
many O
harrowing O
truths O
that O
Friedmann B-PERS
clearly O
had O
in O
mind O
over O
the O
years O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
one O
day O
he O
would O
have O
to O
disappear O
, O
unfortunately O
they O
were O
always O
a O
few O
hours O
faster O
than O
him O
. O

Holland B-LOC
In O
March B-DATE
1941 I-DATE
Friedman B-PERS
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
received O
the O
order O
to O
go O
to O
Holland B-LOC
to O
help O
the O
local O
Joodsche O
Council O
set O
up O
the O
central O
office O
. O

The O
diabolical O
system O
of O
the O
Nazis O
wanted O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
popularity O
and O
trust O
these O
two O
representatives O
enjoyed O
in O
the O
Jewish O
public O
for O
their O
own O
purposes O
. O

Since O
the O
political O
situation O
at O
that O
time O
was O
such O
that O
there O
was O
of O
course O
no O
question O
of O
emigration O
and O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
population O
could O
be O
counted O
on O
to O
help O
implement O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
, O
the O
plan O
was O
completely O
sabotaged O
. O

The O
two O
months O
that O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
spent O
in O
Holland B-LOC
, O
he O
himself O
called O
his O
first O
holiday O
after O
5 O
years O
. O

Every O
day O
he O
wrote O
long O
letters O
about O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
sky O
and O
Dutch B-LOC
painting O
. O

The O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
was O
founded O
neither O
during O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
first O
stay O
with O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
nor O
during O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
second O
stay O
in O
May B-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
but O
only O
much O
later O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
returned O
from O
Holland B-LOC
in O
a O
particularly O
optimistic O
mood O
. O

It O
was O
the O
only O
time O
that O
he O
saw O
the O
politically O
unreal O
. O

In O
Holland B-LOC
the O
invasion O
and O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
were O
expected O
. O

On O
the O
occasion O
of O
his O
departure O
, O
the O
value O
Friedmann B-PERS
represented O
for O
the O
Jewish O
population O
was O
revealed O
. O

You O
had O
to O
event O
. O

reckon O
with O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
would O
not O
come O
back O
and O
he O
felt O
individually O
as O
if O
he O
had O
lost O
his O
moral O
footing O
. O

Suddenly O
there O
was O
a O
lack O
of O
an O
authority O
to O
whom O
one O
could O
turn O
in O
all O
situations O
and O
with O
which O
one O
had O
saddled O
all O
worries O
and O
hardships O
. O

His O
specific O
tasks O
were O
effectively O
divided O
into O
5 O
departments O
, O
mostly O
headed O
by O
old O
, O
well O
- O
rounded O
lawyers O
, O
but O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
everyone O
that O
the O
head O
and O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
company O
were O
missing O
. O

Olomouc B-LOC
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
decisive O
event O
of O
the O
war O
occurred O
, O
the O
attack O
on O
the O
Soviet B-LOC
- O
Union B-LOC
. O

After O
the O
first O
weeks O
of O
victories O
, O
you O
could O
feel O
the O
change O
in O
the O
Nazi O
situation O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
tense O
. O

The O
SS O
overcompensated O
for O
their O
disappointment O
, O
their O
anger O
and O
the O
unacknowledged O
shame O
about O
the O
failures O
expressed O
themselves O
in O
particular O
brutality O
. O

At O
this O
time O
it O
was O
especially O
great O
in O
Olomouc B-LOC
. O

The O
pressure O
of O
the O
notorious O
SS O
- O
man O
Bankl B-PERS
was O
the O
then O
head O
of O
the O
Jewish O
community O
, O
an O
old O
, O
completely O
apolitical O
and O
anxious O
person O
was O
killed O
and O
among O
the O
Jewish O
population O
many O
lived O
wild O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
went O
to O
Olomouc B-LOC
, I-LOC
and O
what O
his O
employees O
there O
later O
told O
about O
his O
work O
seemed O
unlikely O
even O
to O
people O
who O
knew O
Friedmann B-PERS
. O

It O
was O
foolhardy O
in O
a O
sense O
, O
without O
having O
something O
else O
behind O
him O
as O
his O
personal O
courage O
and O
initiative O
, O
he O
bluffed O
the O
SS O
- O
man O
Bankl B-PERS
by O
almost O
reversing O
the O
roles O
and O
appearing O
to O
him O
in O
the O
form O
as O
it O
were O
of O
a O
supervisor O
. O

He O
felt O
, O
as O
he O
later O
laughed O
, O
like O
a O
kind O
of O
animal O
tamer O
. O

The O
method O
was O
successful O
and O
the O
situation O
in O
Olomouc B-LOC
changed O
fundamentally O
. O

There O
was O
also O
an O
enormous O
tension O
of O
the O
physical O
and O
mental O
strength O
and O
as O
minor O
and O
small O
as O
this O
episode O
was O
, O
we O
have O
seldom O
seen O
Friedmann B-PERS
as O
changed O
as O
after O
this O
hussar O
show O
of O
3 O
weeks O
. O

After O
these O
3 O
weeks O
he O
left O
the O
battlefield O
, O
but O
he O
officially O
remained O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Olomouc B-LOC
community O
for O
months O
and O
the O
appeal O
to O
him O
always O
had O
its O
effect O
from O
a O
distance O
. O

Heydrich B-PERS
- O
time O
in O
Prague B-LOC
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
in O
Olomouc B-LOC
for O
a O
few O
days O
when O
he O
was O
dramatically O
recalled O
. O

A O
new O
phase O
had O
started O
. O

The O
ultimate O
great O
tragedy O
of O
Judaism O
began O
! O
Heydrich B-PERS
had O
come O
to O
Prague B-LOC
; O
The O
registration O
of O
Jews O
was O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

Dr O
. O

Hans B-PERS
Bonn I-PERS
and O
Emil B-PERS
Kafka I-PERS
, O
the O
official O
heads O
of O
the O
registration O
department O
, O
were O
arrested O
for O
sabotage O
and O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
was O
fetched O
from O
Olomouc B-LOC
by O
telegram O
. O

No O
one O
else O
grasped O
the O
seriousness O
of O
the O
situation O
as O
completely O
as O
he O
did O
; O
he O
rejected O
all O
optimism O
and O
knew O
that O
the O
two O
colleagues O
, O
of O
whom O
Hans B-PERS
Bonn I-PERS
was O
a O
personal O
friend O
, O
were O
lost O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
the O
first O
transports O
from O
Prague B-LOC
to O
the O
east O
started O
. O

It O
was O
the O
transport O
to O
the O
Lodž B-GHETTO
Ghetto I-GHETTO
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
tragedy O
that O
this O
fact O
meant O
for O
every O
Jewish O
person O
, O
for O
Friedmann B-PERS
it O
meant O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
the O
collapse O
of O
his O
many O
years O
of O
work O
. O

The O
broad O
masses O
of O
the O
population O
, O
which O
should O
have O
been O
preserved O
through O
the O
blind O
commitment O
of O
their O
own O
lives O
, O
were O
now O
sent O
en O
masse O
to O
extermination O
. O

He O
knew O
nothing O
about O
the O
highly O
organized O
death O
machine O
in O
Poland B-LOC
, O
he O
imagined O
the O
matter O
as O
not O
so O
systematic O
, O
but O
certain O
extermination O
of O
large O
parts O
of O
the O
population O
. O

This O
fundamental O
change O
in O
the O
situation O
also O
brought O
about O
a O
fundamental O
change O
in O
its O
position O
to O
the O
whole O
work O
with O
him O
. O

He O
saw O
very O
clearly O
that O
the O
time O
for O
action O
and O
even O
the O
lesser O
evil O
was O
over O
. O

The O
salvation O
of O
one O
person O
had O
to O
be O
bought O
in O
principle O
through O
the O
life O
of O
another O
. O

He O
said O
literally O
that O
from O
that O
day O
on O
one O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
negotiating O
partner O
in O
any O
way O
, O
from O
now O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
only O
needed O
executive O
organs O
. O

A O
concrete O
event O
from O
his O
life O
characterizes O
this O
situation O
. O

A O
mutual O
friend O
, O
whose O
husband O
was O
executed O
as O
a O
communist O
Heydrich B-PERS
's I-PERS
first O
days O
, O
crossed O
the O
border O
illegally O
into O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
made O
the O
specific O
suggestion O
to O
go O
along O
on O
the O
same O
day O
. O

He O
said O
literally O
: O
I've O
come O
back O
from O
London O
countless O
times O
and O
otherwise O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
disappear O
and O
never O
did O
because O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
desert O
. O

I O
no O
longer O
feel O
a O
moral O
obligation O
to O
persevere O
; O
what O
we O
can O
do O
today O
bears O
no O
relation O
to O
the O
price O
we O
will O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

He O
didn't O
talk O
to O
anyone O
else O
about O
it O
, O
because O
he O
didn't O
want O
to O
burden O
anyone O
with O
the O
knowledge O
except O
me O
, O
who O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
failed O
because O
of O
a O
certain O
indolence O
on O
my O
part O
, O
and O
we O
were O
too O
large O
a O
group O
to O
illegally O
cross O
the O
border O
. O

The O
helpers O
should O
come O
back O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
situation O
had O
changed O
and O
Friedmann B-PERS
could O
no O
longer O
leave O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
, O
the O
death O
news O
came O
from O
Dr O
. O

Hans B-PERS
Bonn I-PERS
and O
Kafka B-PERS
. O

There O
was O
general O
panic O
and O
perplexity O
. O

For O
the O
moment O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
felt O
too O
connected O
to O
the O
community O
to O
save O
himself O
above O
all O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

Transports O
The O
transports O
in O
Prague B-LOC

arranged O

community O
had O
the O
right O
to O
draw O
up O
a O
so O
- O
called O
protection O
list O
that O
contained O
the O
names O
of O
the O
employees O
. O

After O
1000 O
participants O
fell O
on O
each O
transport O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
usually O
issued O
1200 O
- O
1300 O
index O
cards O
from O
which O
the O
protected O
employees O
were O
then O
to O
be O
removed O
. O

In O
principle O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
decided O
on O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
individual O
, O
the O
community O
had O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
a O
limited O
right O
to O
complain O
, O
and O
this O
privilege O
naturally O
became O
the O
focus O
of O
protection O
. O

It O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
there O
were O
no O
ideal O
conditions O
in O
these O
matters O
. O

It O
would O
require O
a O
community O
of O
sheer O
superhuman O
idealists O
who O
, O
under O
these O
life O
and O
death O
circumstances O
, O
would O
not O
have O
fought O
for O
the O
ability O
to O
make O
their O
close O
relatives O
and O
friends O
, O
insofar O
as O
they O
had O
the O
power O
to O
do O
so O
, O
members O
of O
the O
community O
. O

The O
community O
of O
Jews O
was O
neither O
worse O
nor O
better O
than O
the O
world O
around O
them O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
suffered O
and O
struggled O
particularly O
under O
this O
problem O
. O

Originally O
he O
had O
a O
completely O
rigid O
position O
, O
he O
said O
that O
no O
one O
had O
the O
right O
to O
declare O
one O
person O
better O
or O
more O
valuable O
and O
to O
decide O
about O
his O
life O
, O
and O
he O
took O
the O
general O
position O
that O
the O
salvation O
of O
one O
should O
pay O
for O
another O
after O
the O
number O
of O
participants O
was O
a O
fixed O
one O
. O

Even O
if O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
keep O
those O
around O
him O
from O
giving O
up O
family O
and O
friendly O
considerations O
, O
he O
strictly O
and O
consistently O
refused O
to O
buy O
someone O
out O
for O
himself O
through O
a O
stranger O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
because O
they O
were O
personal O
friends O
. O

From O
our O
circle O
of O
friends O
he O
stood O
up O
for O
some O
families O
who O
had O
small O
children O
( O
Ing O
. O

Klein B-PERS
, O
Dr O
. O

Winternitz B-PERS
) O
. O

Mrs O
. O

Klara B-PERS
Hutter I-PERS
, O
in O
whose O
house O
he O
had O
found O
a O
second O
home O
in O
Prague B-LOC
and O
whom O
he O
loved O
like O
a O
mother O
, O
went O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
in O
one O
of O
the O
first O
transports O
. O

A O
woman O
who O
was O
originally O
my O
patient O
, O
and O
later O
one O
of O
those O
closest O
to O
me O
, O
Elisabeth B-PERS
Winter I-PERS
because O
single O
and O
without O
children O
and O
also O
went O
on O
one O
of O
the O
first O
transports O
and O
committed O
suicide O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
because O
the O
transport O
should O
go O
east O
. O

There O
was O
, O
however O
, O
a O
general O
political O
standpoint O
accepted O
and O
stood O
up O
for O
two O
people O
who O
were O
described O
as O
correct O
by O
and O
for O
a O
community O
. O

In O
all O
respects O
this O
period O
was O
a O
constant O
moral O
struggle O
and O
always O
required O
new O
concessions O
. O

In O
principle O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
reluctant O
to O
have O
anything O
in O
common O
with O
the O
transport O
administration O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
. O

He O
clearly O
stated O
in O
the O
first O
few O
days O
that O
he O
would O
withdraw O
completely O
and O
was O
not O
ready O
to O
take O
part O
in O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
diabolical O
work O
. O

The O
type O
Mandler B-PERS
, O
known O
to O
be O
bad O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
led O
a O
private O
life O
until O
then O
, O
was O
brought O
in O
and O
took O
over O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
transport O
from O
the O
delivery O
to O
the O
collection O
point O
to O
the O
departure O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
of O
course O
still O
responsible O
for O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
which O
now O
had O
to O
be O
largely O
adjusted O
to O
the O
transports O
, O
especially O
since O
after O
the O
arrest O
Dr O
. O

Hans B-PERS
Bonn I-PERS
and O
Emil B-PERS
Kafka I-PERS
none O
other O
than O
he O
would O
have O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
head O
the O
whole O
company O
. O

The O
handling O
of O
the O
transports O
proceeded O
roughly O
as O
follows O
: O
after O
the O
so O
- O
called O
transport O
list O
was O
drawn O
up O
in O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
it O
was O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

The O
religious O
community O
informed O
the O
people O
about O
their O
inclusion O
in O
the O
transport O
and O
between O
this O
notification O
and O
the O
arrival O
at O
the O
assembly O
point O
about O
3 O
- O
5 O
days O
passed O
. O

In O
these O
days O
everybody O
tried O
to O
submit O
a O
complaint O
for O
whatever O
reason O
. O

All O
of O
these O
complaints O
partly O
due O
to O
economic O
positions O
, O
partly O
due O
to O
so O
- O
called O
unclear O
racial O
conditions O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
due O
to O
illnesses O
, O
went O
through O
the O
apparatus O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
and O
the O
medical O
service O
of O
the O
same O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
community O
made O
available O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
its O
employees O
, O
especially O
the O
young O
people O
, O
and O
even O
older O
children O
took O
part O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
auxiliary O
service O
. O

The O
same O
helps O
those O
affected O
with O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
transport O
, O
with O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
household O
, O
procurement O
of O
food O
, O
suitcases O
, O
etc O
. O

and O
finally O
the O
wagon O
and O
people O
brought O
the O
luggage O
to O
the O
collection O
point O
. O

A O
special O
technique O
of O
packing O
and O
special O
aids O
were O
developed O
, O
which O
had O
a O
peculiar O
specific O
character O
, O
which O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
and O
whose O
imagination O
hardly O
anyone O
will O
get O
used O
to O
who O
has O
not O
gone O
through O
this O
gruesome O
time O
. O

The O
dissolution O
and O
devastation O
of O
every O
once O
cozy O
family O
circle O
repeatedly O
made O
a O
shocking O
impression O
. O

Those O
involved O
were O
mostly O
the O
calmest O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

Everything O
almost O
always O
happened O
calmly O
, O
there O
were O
relatively O
few O
hysterical O
situations O
and O
only O
when O
you O
were O
there O
yourself O
did O
you O
understand O
how O
all O
friends O
had O
been O
so O
calm O
before O
. O

At O
this O
point O
also O
a O
question O
of O
principle O
. O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
found O
it O
eerie O
again O
and O
again O
that O
all O
these O
masses O
of O
people O
- O
even O
if O
one O
did O
not O
grasp O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
tragedy O
at O
the O
time O
- O
obeyed O
the O
mass O
agitation O
so O
calmly O
and O
so O
were O
disciplined O
, O
so O
without O
any O
defense O
. O

He O
kept O
asking O
himself O
, O
and O
this O
question O
preoccupied O
and O
tormented O
him O
during O
the O
entire O
time O
of O
the O
transports O
, O
whether O
the O
administrative O
assistance O
of O
the O
community O
made O
this O
process O
easier O
or O
even O
possible O
. O

From O
a O
comparison O
with O
other O
countries O
, O
where O
the O
matter O
was O
going O
on O
less O
calmly O
, O
it O
emerged O
that O
where O
the O
Jews O
were O
indiscriminately O
caught O
by O
blocking O
streets O
and O
city O
blocks O
almost O
without O
prior O
agreement O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
always O
had O
a O
sufficient O
staff O
of O
drivers O
and O
decrees O
by O
leading O
organs O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
action O
planned O
each O
time O
. O

The O
argument O
that O
more O
people O
could O
escape O
and O
hide O
in O
a O
chaotic O
situation O
is O
also O
invalid O
. O

Something O
critically O
important O
has O
to O
be O
recorded O
. O

Every O
Jew O
personally O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
flee O
and O
go O
into O
illegality O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
period O
of O
3 O
- O
5 O
days O
that O
lay O
between O
the O
notification O
and O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
transport O
, O
you O
could O
even O
prepare O
everything O
for O
the O
illegality O
in O
peace O
, O
you O
could O
live O
undisturbed O
in O
your O
apartment O
until O
the O
notification O
and O
had O
time O
in O
these O
3 O
- O
5 O
days O
to O
disappear O
. O

No O
Jew O
who O
did O
not O
join O
the O
transport O
was O
seriously O
or O
consistently O
wanted O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
had O
agreed O
that O
the O
municipality O
would O
notify O
the O
Czech B-LOC
police O
of O
the O
non O
- O
appearance O
and O
that O
the O
Czech B-LOC
police O
had O
to O
find O
the O
person O
concerned O
. O

It O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
specifically O
stated O
that O
this O
was O
purely O
pro O
forma O
, O
that O
one O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
one O
- O
time O
appearance O
in O
the O
apartment O
of O
the O
person O
concerned O
and O
with O
the O
explanation O
that O
he O
had O
disappeared O
and O
that O
the O
case O
was O
reported O
as O
undetectable O
. O

The O
reason O
why O
so O
few O
disappeared O
was O
the O
same O
as O
for O
all O
other O
non O
- O
Jewish O
people O
who O
were O
somehow O
politically O
threatened O
and O
still O
fell O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
reason O
was O
the O
tremendous O
and O
ever O
increasing O
terror O
, O
the O
incredibly O
dense O
network O
of O
Gestapo B-ORG
agents O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
each O
individual O
absolutely O
had O
to O
take O
a O
group O
of O
people O
in O
the O
illegality O
into O
their O
trust O
, O
who O
would O
shelter O
them O
and O
provide O
them O
with O
the O
most O
necessary O
food O
and O
all O
of O
them O
were O
in O
mortal O
danger O
. O

The O
individual O
did O
not O
lack O
the O
courage O
to O
lead O
the O
life O
of O
a O
hidden O
and O
hunted O
animal O
, O
but O
very O
few O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
put O
a O
group O
of O
people O
, O
even O
if O
they O
were O
the O
closest O
relatives O
and O
friends O
, O
in O
constant O
mortal O
danger O
. O

Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
After O
the O
first O
transports O
to O
the O
Lodz B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
, O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
was O
set O
up O
, O
which O
was O
originally O
intended O
for O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
Protectorate O
. O

Edelstein B-PERS
, O
with O
a O
group O
of O
employees O
, O
volunteered O
to O
lead O
the O
camp O
. O

After O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
the O
only O
camp O
accessible O
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
concentrated O
more O
and O
more O
on O
supplying O
this O
camp O
. O

A O
separate O
department O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
department O
G O
, O
was O
set O
up O
in O
the O
religious O
community O
, O
which O
had O
the O
task O
of O
supplying O
the O
ghetto O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
time O
this O
department O
G O
became O
the O
absolute O
domain O
of O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
and O
what O
was O
going O
on O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
this O
legal O
institution O
in O
the O
form O
of O
breakneck O
and O
daring O
illegal O
transfers O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
in O
detail O
in O
a O
short O
report O
. O

There O
existed O
the O
basic O
approval O
of O
the O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
the O
Ghetto B-GHETTO
Theresienstadt I-GHETTO
with O
the O
most O
essential O
things O
of O
Prague B-LOC
from O
supplying O
, O
uzw O
. O

partly O
through O
purchases O
, O
the O
control O
of O
which O
was O
reserved O
to O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
partly O
from O
the O
holdings O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
. O

The O
necessities O
were O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
this O
principle O
approved O
now O
at O
his O
own O
risk O
by O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
, O
who O
alone O
against O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
implementation O
of O
this O
agenda O
, O
all O
the O
ghetto O
needed O
and O
what O
kind O
of O
legally O
and O
mostly O
illegal O
achievable O
ways O
, O
bought O
up O
the O
in O
maximum O
quantities O
and O
made O
it O
out O
. O

The O
examples O
could O
be O
cited O
in O
the O
thousands O
, O
starting O
with O
the O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
sacks O
of O
straw O
that O
were O
in O
such O
quantities O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
that O
they O
sometimes O
rotted O
in O
the O
dirt O
in O
the O
courtyards O
, O
food O
, O
apartment O
and O
kitchen O
inventory O
, O
musical O
instruments O
, O
books O
, O
writing O
and O
drawing O
materials O
to O
the O
fantastic O
supply O
of O
medicines O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
tangible O
and O
material O
remains O
( O
apart O
from O
the O
thousands O
of O
rescued O
humans O
) O
of O
the O
activity O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
undertook O
, O
after O
destruction O
of O
all O
documents O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
medical O
material O
and O
drugs O
, O
which O
were O
found O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
even O
after O
liberation O
astounded O
every O
outsider O
, O
who O
assumed O
that O
all O
of O
this O
must O
have O
been O
done O
with O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
was O
a O
clear O
testimony O
to O
the O
activity O
of O
R. B-PERS
F. I-PERS
in O
these O
times O
. O

A O
few O
more O
words O
on O
this O
question O
. O

An O
action O
was O
held O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Jewish O
doctors O
and O
pharmacists O
toured O
almost O
the O
whole O
Protectorate O
and O
bought O
huge O
amounts O
of O
hidden O
medicine O
reserves O
from O
the O
Czech B-LOC
pharmacies O
, O
which O
were O
happy O
to O
help O
in O
this O
action O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
items O
were O
paid O
for O
accordingly O
, O
which O
the O
Nazis O
never O
saw O
would O
have O
done O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
succeeded O
in O
buying O
up O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
morphine O
in O
a O
way O
that O
none O
of O
us O
had O
ever O
known O
, O
which O
not O
only O
guaranteed O
the O
supply O
in O
the O
years O
of O
existence O
of O
the O
ghetto O
, O
but O
was O
probably O
also O
partly O
available O
after O
the O
liberation O
. O

This O
morphine O
in O
the O
form O
of O
dry O
cubes O
was O
in O
his O
apartment O
for O
weeks O
until O
the O
opportunity O
arose O
to O
smuggle O
it O
via O
illegal O
routes O
into O
the O
ghetto O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
supply O
large O
parts O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
army O
with O
morphine O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
there O
was O
such O
a O
shortage O
that O
in O
the O
area O
of O
​​the O
German O
Reich O
the O
use O
of O
poppy O
seeds O
was O
subject O
to O
the O
highest O
punishment O
and O
one O
spoke O
of O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

Typical O
of O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
attitude O
towards O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
supply O
issue O
was O
an O
anecdote O
that O
circulated O
about O
him O
and O
which O
is O
also O
recorded O
in O
a O
humorous O
poem O
by O
the O
G O
department O
. O

There O
is O
talk O
of O
1000 O
kg O
hyper O
manganate O
. O

When O
he O
was O
told O
by O
telephone O
that O
hyper O
manganate O
was O
available O
and O
how O
much O
one O
could O
buy O
, O
he O
replied O
as O
usual O
that O
he O
wanted O
everything O
you O
could O
get O
, O
at O
least O
1000 O
kg O
. O

It O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
particularly O
emphasized O
that O
the O
money O
for O
the O
procurement O
was O
fought O
for O
in O
the O
usual O
manner O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
constant O
tough O
fighting O
and O
with O
constant O
falsification O
of O
the O
budget O
proposal O
. O

During O
this O
time O
it O
often O
happened O
that O
Friedmann B-PERS
got O
into O
debts O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
with O
other O
departments O
of O
the O
religious O
community O
and O
the O
grotesque O
situation O
arose O
that O
he O
stood O
there O
with O
a O
bad O
conscience O
in O
front O
of O
his O
creditors O
as O
if O
they O
were O
gambling O
debts O
until O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
approved O
a O
larger O
sum O
. O

On O
the O
day O
before O
his O
deportation O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
approved O
6 O
million O
crowns O
for O
the O
G O
department O
and O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
carefree O
like O
never O
before O
. O

However O
, O
all O
this O
would O
not O
be O
possible O
if O
the O
Jewish O
community O
had O
not O
had O
the O
help O
of O
the O
SS O
- O
man O
Bartels B-PERS
. O

This O
was O
the O
only O
SS O
- O
man O
who O
in O
all O
the O
years O
provided O
illegal O
aid O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
said O
too O
little O
about O
the O
person O
of O
this O
man O
and O
lost O
contact O
with O
him O
later O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
me O
to O
characterize O
it O
clearly O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
motives O
that O
determined O
his O
actions O
, O
without O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
SS O
- O
man O
Bartels B-PERS
rendered O
the O
Jews O
valuable O
services O
during O
this O
period O
. O

The O
following O
event O
that O
sticks O
in O
my O
memory O
is O
typical O
of O
the O
situation O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
received O
a O
complaint O
against O
Bartels B-PERS
from O
a O
pharmaceutical O
company O
that O
was O
under O
German B-LOC
management O
at O
the O
time O
( O
I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
Medika O
) O
, O
stating O
that O
it O
was O
approving O
disproportionate O
amounts O
of O
drugs O
for O
Jewish O
purposes O
. O

( O
Bartels B-PERS
was O
namely O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
advisor O
for O
economic O
matters O
and O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
responsible O
for O
supplying O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
) O
. O

Bartels B-PERS
turned O
to O
Friedmann B-PERS
quite O
at O
a O
loss O
as O
to O
what O
to O
do O
about O
the O
matter O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
sent O
him O
the O
letter O
to O
the O
pharmaceut O
. O

company O
, O
in O
which O
he O
declared O
that O
he O
would O
be O
ready O
at O
once O
to O
leave O
the O
supply O
of O
medicines O
to O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
to O
the O
company O
if O
the O
company O
gave O
him O
a O
written O
declaration O
that O
it O
assumed O
responsibility O
for O
the O
prevention O
of O
epidemics O
that O
did O
not O
recognize O
racial O
boundaries O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
a O
detailed O
description O
of O
the O
hygienic O
conditions O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
, O
and O
the O
matter O
was O
smoothed O
out O
in O
this O
way O
. O

Negotiations O
between O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
economic O
group O
Bertsch B-PERS
In O
connection O
with O
SS O
- O
man O
Bartels B-PERS
the O
following O
must O
be O
recorded O
. O

A O
few O
months O
after O
the O
start O
of O
the O
deportation O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
the O
economic O
group O
around O
Bertsch B-PERS
began O
to O
trend O
towards O
stopping O
the O
deportation O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
using O
them O
as O
workers O
in O
the O
context O
of O
general O
labour O
. O

Certainly O
there O
were O
no O
humane O
considerations O
that O
led O
to O
this O
attitude O
, O
either O
they O
actually O
did O
not O
want O
to O
lose O
the O
too O
cheap O
labor O
of O
the O
Jewish O
worker O
in O
their O
internal O
marrow O
, O
or O
it O
was O
principled O
opposition O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
because O
, O
as O
I O
already O
mentioned O
, O
the O
different O
groups O
stood O
against O
each O
other O
with O
hostility O
, O
not O
even O
for O
ideological O
reasons O
, O
but O
because O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
always O
got O
the O
richest O
and O
fattest O
piece O
of O
the O
common O
spoil O
. O

This O
fact O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
essential O
pillars O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
tactics O
of O
the O
oppressed O
minority O
and O
it O
was O
often O
possible O
to O
achieve O
certain O
advantages O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
antagonism O
by O
pitting O
one O
authority O
against O
the O
other O
. O

This O
time O
it O
was O
about O
the O
greatest O
thing O
that O
could O
be O
achieved O
in O
this O
way O
. O

The O
Bertsch B-PERS
economic O
group O
needed O
material O
to O
prove O
the O
unprofitablity O
of O
the O
extermination O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

SS O
- O
mann O
Bartels B-PERS
had O
relations O
with O
this O
group O
and O
knew O
about O
its O
tendencies O
and O
Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
provided O
the O
statistical O
and O
other O
material O
as O
a O
basis O
for O
the O
negotiations O
, O
which O
were O
repeated O
two O
or O
three O
times O
at O
regular O
intervals O
. O

The O
tension O
Friedmann B-PERS
went O
through O
in O
the O
days O
of O
negotiations O
known O
to O
him O
through O
Bartels B-PERS
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
always O
emerged O
victorious O
. O

Deep O
depression O
followed O
and O
after O
a O
short O
time O
the O
struggle O
started O
again O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
here O
too O
, O
as O
in O
matters O
of O
great O
politics O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
remained O
victor O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

Change O
of O
internal O
situation O
Even O
if O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
completely O
in O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
the O
changed O
political O
situation O
, O
in O
which O
the O
defeat O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
became O
ever O
clearer O
and O
clearer O
, O
was O
not O
without O
consequences O
for O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
SS O
and O
fundamentally O
changed O
their O
attitude O
and O
behavior O
. O

At O
this O
point O
it O
must O
be O
emphasized O
once O
again O
that O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
attitude O
towards O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
either O
exaggeratedly O
correct O
or O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
mood O
and O
situation O
, O
rather O
challenging O
and O
arrogant O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
always O
hostile O
. O

However O
, O
since O
the O
negotiating O
partners O
were O
of O
a O
clumsiness O
and O
primitiveness O
that O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
imagine O
for O
someone O
who O
did O
not O
know O
these O
gentlemen O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
not O
content O
with O
the O
attitude O
, O
but O
expressed O
his O
attitude O
in O
clear O
words O
. O

In O
negotiations O
he O
spoke O
again O
and O
again O
of O
correct O
enmity O
, O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
he O
and O
they O
would O
be O
condemned O
to O
negotiate O
with O
one O
another O
and O
that O
everyone O
had O
to O
defend O
his O
claims O
with O
the O
means O
at O
his O
disposal O
. O

In O
all O
these O
years O
he O
never O
had O
any O
doubts O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
partnership O
is O
currently O
an O
unequal O
one O
, O
that O
although O
they O
have O
all O
the O
power O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
that O
he O
would O
still O
not O
surrender O
because O
he O
was O
not O
afraid O
for O
himself O
and O
because O
he O
was O
convinced O
that O
his O
cause O
is O
ultimately O
the O
thing O
. O

All O
of O
this O
was O
possible O
and O
relatively O
safe O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Germany B-LOC
was O
going O
from O
one O
victory O
to O
another O
. O

The O
situation O
changed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
when O
these O
gentlemen O
were O
haunted O
by O
uncertainty O
, O
doubt O
and O
feelings O
of O
inferiority O
. O

What O
happened O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
happened O
here O
on O
a O
small O
scale O
, O
the O
thought O
became O
unbearable O
for O
them O
that O
the O
enemy O
, O
whom O
they O
cynically O
and O
confidently O
wanted O
to O
humiliate O
and O
destroy O
, O
should O
now O
witness O
their O
own O
defeat O
. O

Richard B-PERS
Friedmann I-PERS
and O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
, O
whose O
specialty O
was O
holding O
political O
talks O
with O
them O
, O
became O
a O
symbol O
of O
the O
relentless O
enemy O
now O
triumphing O
over O
their O
defeat O
for O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
with O
whom O
they O
had O
negotiated O
over O
the O
years O
. O

In O
their O
primitiveness O
, O
they O
themselves O
characterized O
the O
situation O
through O
the O
following O
little O
incident O
. O

On O
a O
day O
when O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
suffered O
a O
major O
defeat O
, O
Günther B-PERS
( O
the O
head O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
) O
suddenly O
yelled O
at O
Friedmann B-PERS
why O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
good O
mood O
. O

He O
drew O
his O
attention O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
if O
things O
got O
worse O
, O
the O
Jews O
would O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
laugh O
at O
either O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
then O
said O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
time O
when O
he O
would O
no O
longer O
laugh O
. O

In O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
transports O
Günther B-PERS
asked O
Jakob B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
literally O
: O
What O
does O
Friedmann O
say O
now O
, O
is O
he O
still O
laughing O
? O
In O
the O
second O
half O
of O
1942 B-DATE
there O
were O
days O
and O
weeks O
when O
Günther B-PERS
refused O
to O
speak O
to O
Friedmann B-PERS
at O
all O
; O
he O
simply O
couldn't O
stand O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
clear O
that O
these O
SS O
- O
men O
were O
determined O
that O
people O
like O
Friedmann B-PERS
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
for O
them O
the O
concentrated O
enemy O
of O
Judaism O
, O
not O
get O
to O
experience O
defeat O
and O
that O
they O
also O
had O
the O
power O
to O
prevent O
this O
. O

There O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
they O
had O
to O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
world O
in O
the O
final O
phase O
, O
in O
which O
they O
were O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
defeat O
, O
and O
it O
was O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
and O
it O
just O
mattered O
which O
of O
the O
two O
was O
the O
fastest O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
knew O
that O
he O
had O
to O
go O
. O

The O
situation O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
acute O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
spied O
on O
, O
more O
than O
ever O
before O
, O
he O
felt O
it O
and O
also O
talked O
about O
it O
. O

However O
, O
around O
this O
time O
he O
was O
doing O
the O
most O
daring O
things O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
care O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
somehow O
out O
of O
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
was O
the O
last O
effort O
anyway O
and O
he O
would O
not O
have O
much O
time O
left O
. O

The O
carelessness O
he O
committed O
included O
direct O
telephone O
contact O
with O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
mostly O
at O
night O
from O
his O
apartment O
and O
also O
directly O
from O
the O
office O
. O

This O
fact O
became O
known O
to O
Günther B-PERS
in O
a O
way O
that O
later O
became O
known O
, O
but O
which O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
. O

One O
day O
in O
December B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
summoned O
to O
Günther B-PERS
's I-PERS
office O
and O
subjected O
to O
an O
interrogation O
in O
which O
he O
naturally O
denied O
everything O
. O

Afterwards O
Friedmann B-PERS
could O
hardly O
move O
his O
legs O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
officially O
had O
to O
stay O
at O
home O
with O
sciatica O
, O
he O
admitted O
140 O
squats O
from O
this O
interrogation O
to O
his O
closest O
friends O
. O

None O
of O
us O
ever O
heard O
what O
else O
happened O
there O
. O

We O
also O
knew O
that O
Günther B-PERS
was O
not O
open O
- O
hearted O
and O
clearly O
stated O
to O
Friedmann B-PERS
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
last O
time O
he O
would O
get O
away O
so O
cheaply O
, O
the O
next O
time O
there O
would O
be O
concentration O
camps O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
knew O
that O
himself O
, O
however O
. O

It O
was O
December B-DATE
1942 I-DATE
and O
we O
were O
seriously O
considering O
fleeing O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
Friedmann B-PERS
could O
not O
speak O
the O
Czech B-LOC
language O
made O
the O
situation O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
more O
difficult O
; O
he O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
to O
Switzerland B-LOC
via O
Austria B-LOC
. O

On O
January B-DATE
28 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
an O
unexpected O
event O
occurred O
. O

In O
celebration O
of O
10 O
years O
of O
National O
Socialism O
the O
liquidated O
Jewish O
question O
was O
laid O
as O
a O
gift O
at O
the O
Führer O
’s O
feet O
. O

The O
religious O
communities O
of O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
were O
officially O
dissolved O
, O
the O
leading O
functionaries O
were O
assigned O
to O
the O
ghetto O
and O
the O
remaining O
offices O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
were O
subordinated O
to O
a O
council O
of O
elders O
. O

A O
few O
days O
before O
you O
could O
feel O
at O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
that O
something O
was O
being O
prepared O
. O

On O
the O
night O
before O
January B-DATE
28 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1943 I-DATE
, O
those O
closest O
to O
me O
found O
out O
that O
Dr O
. O

Weidmann B-PERS
, O
the O
official O
head O
of O
the O
cultural O
community O
in O
Prague B-LOC
had O
discreetly O
received O
the O
order O
from O
Günther B-PERS
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
transport O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
spent O
the O
night O
of O
January B-DATE
28th I-DATE
at O
Weidmann B-PERS
’ O
s O
, O
as O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
he O
and O
some O
other O
closest O
staff O
would O
come O
to O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
in O
the O
morning O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
Weidmann B-PERS
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
did O
not O
, O
of O
course O
, O
talk O
about O
it O
among O
his O
colleagues O
in O
order O
not O
to O
burden O
anyone O
with O
the O
knowledge O
, O
but O
he O
was O
determined O
to O
disappear O
immediately O
. O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
January B-DATE
28 I-DATE
, I-DATE
43 I-DATE
, O
while O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
at O
the O
central B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
Mrs O

Eugenie B-PERS
Dangl I-PERS
was O
in O
our O
apartment O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
had O
met O
her O
in O
the O
circles O
of O
Legationsrat O
Dr O

Kamil B-PERS
Hofmann I-PERS
, O
and O
she O
, O
as O
an O
honest O

self O
- O
sacrificing O
German B-LOC
anti O

fascist O
, O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
help O
out O
in O
the O
illegality O
due O
to O
her O
relationships O
and O
did O
so O
with O
all O
her O
strength O

She O
was O
ready O
to O
make O
her O
apartment O
available O
for O
a O
temporary O
illegal O
stay O

of O

this O
was O
out O

we O
were O
preparing O
about O
the O
possibility O
of O
illegally O
crossing O
the O

into O
Switzerland B-LOC

At O
11 O
o'clock O
it O

- O
known O
from O
Zionist O
circles O
, O
were O
arrested O
in O
an O
elegant O
way O
: O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
return O
to O
their O
apartments O
or O
to O
telephone O
their O
relatives O
and O
were O
deported O
to O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
on O
the O
same O
day O
as O
so O
- O
called O
single O
travelers O
. O

The O
families O
and O
their O
luggage O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
forwarded O
the O
next O
day O
. O

There O
were O
24 O
hours O
in O
which O
neither O
those O
involved O
nor O
their O
relatives O
believed O
that O
they O
would O
actually O
meet O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

A O
legitimate O
suspicion O
always O
told O
you O
that O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
officially O
declared O
would O
be O
true O
. O

This O
attitude O
was O
later O
increased O
to O
the O
point O
of O
morbidity O
in O
the O
concentration O
camps O
. O

You O
just O
didn't O
believe O
anything O
anymore O
. O

This O
time O
it O
wasn't O
a O
lie O
for O
once O
. O

On O
January B-DATE

, I-DATE

Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
The O
description O
of O
the O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
required O
a O
separate O
or O
several O
extensive O
volumes O
and O
therefore O
I O
have O
to O
limit O
myself O
to O
a O
few O
keywords O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
give O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
one O
- O
sided O
judgment O
due O
to O
the O
brevity O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
begin O
with O
the O
following O
. O

( O
I O
am O
speaking O
of O
the O
phenomena O
of O
internal O
life O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
reaction O
of O
the O
interned O
Jewish O
masses O
, O
not O
of O
the O
institutions O
of O
the O
SS O
, O
which O
are O
all O
too O
well O
known O
) O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
many O
negative O
phenomena O
that O
emerged O
under O
these O
terrible O
living O
conditions O
and O
under O
this O
constant O
pressure O
of O
fear O
of O
death O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
this O
Jewish O
collective O
is O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
certainly O
a O
positive O
one O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
other O
concentration O
camps O
, O
in O
which O
the O
majority O
of O
internees O
were O
political O
prisoners O
, O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
had O
a O
population O
that O
was O
composed O
of O
all O
social O
classes O
. O

In O
general O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
precisely O
those O
properties O
that O
were O
also O
internally O
ascribed O
to O
the O
Jews O
as O
negative O
have O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incorrect O
. O

The O
Jews O
brought O
about O
an O
incredible O
technical O
and O
organizational O
achievement O
. O

The O
forced O
relocation O
of O
the O
men O
's O
barracks O
of O
5000 O
people O
within O
24 O
hours O
, O
which O
roughly O
corresponds O
to O
the O
relocation O
of O
a O
small O
town O
, O
was O
a O
miracle O
in O
terms O
of O
technical O
and O
other O
work O
performance O
. O

The O
hygiene O
of O
the O
individual O
under O
these O
inconceivable O
difficulties O
was O
also O
admirable O
. O

The O
youth O
, O
partly O
organized O
in O
a O
Zionist O
way O
, O
partly O
included O
in O
the O
very O
strong O
illegal O
communist O
organization O
, O
was O
morally O
and O
culturally O
at O
a O
level O
hardly O
matched O
by O
a O
youth O
anywhere O
else O
at O
this O
time O
in O
the O
area O
occupied O
by O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Where O
, O
strangely O
enough O
, O
the O
Jews O
failed O
almost O
completely O
, O
that O
was O
in O
their O
administration O
, O
so O
that O
the O
saying O
, O
Theresienstadt O
is O
a O
concentration O
camp O
, O
aggravated O
by O
self O
- O
administration O
was O
rightly O
common O
. O

It O
was O
for O
something O
like O
this O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
the O
people O
employed O
in O
the O
administration O
were O
recruited O
from O
the O
Jewish O
petty O
bourgeoisie O
. O

Through O
the O
grotesque O
miniature O
state O
that O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
represented O
through O
self O
- O
government O
, O
these O
people O
came O
to O
positions O
that O
gave O
them O
power O
like O
hardly O
ever O
before O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

In O
grueling O
everyday O
life O
, O
like O
every O
other O
petty O
bourgeoisie O
, O
they O
lost O
their O
relationship O
with O
the O
big O
events O
and O
exploited O
their O
positions O
of O
power O
in O
the O
most O
unpleasant O
way O
for O
the O
community O
. O

It O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
each O
of O
these O
positions O
also O
provided O
a O
relative O
protection O
from O
the O
transports O
to O
the O
East O
and O
so O
it O
was O
natural O
that O
everyone O
who O
was O
at O
the O
helm O
tended O
to O
his O
entire O
family O
- O
and O
friends O
in O
the O
administrative O
apparatus O
to O
accommodate O
and O
so O
arose O
over O
a O
real O
jungle O
of O
administrative O
, O
corruption O
and O
clique O
economy O
. O

The O
deepest O
root O
of O
this O
sad O
evil O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
it O
was O
the O
Jews O
themselves O
who O
had O
to O
fully O
decide O
on O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
transport O
lists O
to O
the O
east O
. O

It O
does O
not O
need O
to O
be O
elaborated O
on O
which O
power O
apparatus O
the O
so O
- O
called O
transport O
derivative O
represented O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
noted O
all O
this O
in O
the O
first O
24 O
hours O
of O
his O
stay O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
when O
we O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
the O
next O
day O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
, O
for O
the O
only O
time O
in O
these O
years O
- O
not O
excluding O
the O
hours O
before O
his O
execution O
- O
somehow O
disturbed O
and O
unbalanced O
. O

In O
this O
sector O
he O
was O
particularly O
shocked O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
whose O
moral O
strength O
and O
purity O
he O
could O
not O
doubt O
, O
had O
not O
been O
strong O
enough O
to O
prevent O
all O
of O
this O
. O

He O
never O
understood O
that O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
Prague B-LOC
practice O
, O
they O
had O
taken O
on O
themselves O
to O
decide O
the O
life O
and O
death O
of O
the O
individual O
members O
of O
the O
community O
. O

There O
have O
been O
many O
discussions O
between O
Friedmann B-PERS
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
, O
but O
this O
is O
too O
intimate O
for O
a O
third O
party O
to O
speak O
about O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
later O
also O
explained O
this O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
people O
who O
belonged O
to O
Edelstein B-PERS
's I-PERS
closest O
circle O
were O
loyal O
and O
devoted O
to O
him O
personally O
, O
but O
were O
never O
human O
or O
politically O
close O
to O
his O
format O
, O
they O
were O
small O
people O
who O
even O
developed O
a O
kind O
of O
local O
patriotism O
in O
their O
positions O
of O
power O
. O

The O
first O
arrivals O
later O
acted O
like O
a O
kind O
of O
pioneers O
, O
it O
was O
the O
aristocracy O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
who O
looked O
down O
on O
the O
later O
arrivals O
with O
a O
certain O
disregard O
. O

All O
these O
intellectual O
perversities O
that O
arose O
in O
this O
abnormal O
situation O
would O
be O
more O
grotesque O
than O
tragic O
if O
they O
did O
not O
always O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
have O
grown O
in O
practice O
. O

Situations O
arose O
where O
excellent O
surgeons O
or O
other O
specialists O
who O
had O
arrived O
later O
were O
unemployed O
because O
the O
less O
talented O
who O
had O
arrived O
earlier O
had O
a O
moral O
right O
to O
their O
managerial O
position O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
judge O
how O
far O
the O
insight O
into O
these O
internal O
circumstances O
influenced O
Friedmann B-PERS
; O
in O
any O
case O
, O
it O
was O
in O
the O
line O
of O
his O
decisions O
to O
disappear O
from O
so O
- O
called O
public O
life O
as O
soon O
as O
his O
work O
was O
no O
longer O
crucially O
necessary O
. O

After O
no O
one O
insisted O
on O
assuming O
a O
managerial O
position O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
due O
to O
the O
circumstances O
mentioned O
above O
, O
he O
carried O
out O
his O
decisions O
consistently O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
his O
arrival O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
sent O
to O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
as O
a O
so O
- O
called O
prominent O
. O

The O
Nazis O
referred O
to O
people O
as O
prominents O
who O
, O
firstly O
, O
were O
assumed O
to O
be O
known O
abroad O
, O
and O
secondly O
, O
honored O
some O
of O
the O
bad O
types O
who O
had O
served O
them O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
occupation O
. O

Prominents O
included O
in O
principle O
all O
university O
professors O
, O
former O
diplomats O
, O
high O
ranking O
military O
and O
leading O
people O
from O
the O
Jewish O
public O
life O
. O

The O
celebrities O
had O
certain O
privileges O
, O
the O
right O
to O
their O
own O
apartment O
with O
their O
families O
, O
certain O
albeit O
very O
small O
allotments O
of O
food O
and O
no O
obligation O
to O
work O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
rejected O
the O
preferential O
treatment O
on O
principle O
, O
as O
it O
was O
officially O
the O
initiative O
of O
the O
Nazi O
authorities O
. O

During O
the O
entire O
time O
he O
was O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
did O
not O
receive O
any O
food O
allowance O
. O

He O
underwent O
the O
work O
requirement O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
his O
arrival O
by O
attending O
the O
so O
- O
called O
hundred O
. O

The O
hundred O
was O
a O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
specialty O
; O
every O
newcomer O
was O
obliged O
, O
regardless O
of O
his O
/ O
her O
qualifications O
, O
to O
do O
physical O
, O
so O
- O
called O
black O
work O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
of O
time O
. O

This O
included O
cleaning O
work O
, O
sewer O
work O
, O
corpse O
stretcher O
duty O
and O
other O
things O
. O

When O
asked O
by O
his O
friends O
, O
especially O
with O
regard O
to O
illegal O
work O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
forced O
to O
accept O
his O
own O
apartment O
. O

This O
was O
a O
privilege O
that O
the O
Jewish O
self O
- O
government O
would O
of O
course O
have O
offered O
him O
under O
all O
circumstances O
. O

For O
Friedmann B-PERS
personally O
, O
the O
stay O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
was O
a O
break O
after O
years O
. O

After O
he O
no O
longer O
worked O
in O
the O
hundred O
, O
he O
tried O
to O
work O
as O
part O
of O
the O
economic O
department O
in O
a O
subordinate O
position O
, O
but O
could O
not O
reconcile O
with O
the O
situation O
and O
eventually O
participated O
in O
the O
work O
no O
longer O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
’s I-PERS
successor O
as O
Jewish O
elder O
of O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
informed O
him O
that O
it O
was O
unacceptable O
that O
he O
sabotaged O
the O
cooperation O
and O
that O
the O
higher O
authority O
wished O
that O
he O
would O
use O
his O
abilities O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
rejected O
this O
to O
Eppstein B-PERS
in O
the O
most O
unequivocal O
and O
uncompromising O
manner O
and O
from O
this O
point O
on O
went O
as O
a O
worker O
in O
an O
agricultural O
group O
. O

Shortly O
before O
his O
deportation O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
was O
renewed O
in O
full O
from O
Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
had O
to O
give O
up O
his O
work O
in O
agriculture O
and O
take O
on O
a O
role O
in O
the O
work O
center O
. O

This O
time O
was O
a O
very O
unpleasant O
one O
for O
him O
, O
he O
had O
to O
struggle O
with O
pettiness O
and O
vanity O
and O
these O
things O
in O
the O
circle O
of O
his O
Jewish O
employees O
sometimes O
wore O
him O
down O
more O
than O
the O
life O
- O
threatening O
fight O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
In O
this O
context O
it O
is O
absolutely O
necessary O
to O
briefly O
talk O
about O
Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
because O
he O
is O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
tragic O
and O
fateful O
existence O
as O
a O
direct O
result O
of O
the O
immense O
pressure O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Dr O
Eppstein B-PERS
was O
a O
young O
talented O
docent O
of O
national O
economics O
, O
not O
very O
original O
, O
not O
very O
brave O
and O
would O
not O
in O
any O
way O
become O
much O
more O
noticeable O
under O
normal O
circumstances O
. O

Through O
emigration O
and O
the O
death O
of O
his O
predecessors O
, O
over O
time O
he O
automatically O
came O
to O
a O
leading O
position O
in O
the O
Reich O
Association O
of O
Jews O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
was O
arrested O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
morally O
broken O
while O
in O
custody O
. O

He O
had O
given O
in O
to O
the O
immense O
pressure O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
since O
then O
has O
been O
their O
willing O
instrument O
in O
all O
things O
. O

He O
was O
the O
right O
man O
to O
take O
over O
the O
position O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
at O
this O
time O
when O
, O
as O
I O
said O
in O
the O
introduction O
, O
only O
comfortable O
executive O
organs O
were O
necessary O
. O

Apart O
from O
internal O
grievances O
against O
which O
he O
was O
too O
weak O
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
the O
most O
out O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

His O
initiative O
, O
his O
courage O
and O
his O
quick O
- O
wittedness O
had O
succeeded O
in O
creating O
a O
relatively O
tolerable O
atmosphere O
from O
the O
original O
concentration O
camp O
, O
in O
which O
19 O
young O
people O
were O
publicly O
executed O
in O
the O
early O
days O
. O

In O
1943 B-DATE
, O
Eppstein B-PERS
also O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
and O
Edelstein B-PERS
had O
to O
hand O
over O
his O
position O
as O
Jewish O
elder O
to O
him O
and O
was O
appointed O
as O
his O
deputy O
. O

Since O
two O
worlds O
collided O
here O
, O
cooperation O
, O
although O
this O
would O
be O
of O
the O
greatest O
importance O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
collective O
, O
was O
absolutely O
impossible O
. O

In O
his O
whole O
attitude O
and O
in O
his O
whole O
practice O
, O
Eppstein B-PERS
was O
the O
exact O
opposite O
of O
the O
working O
method O
of O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
their O
circle O
described O
up O
to O
now O
. O

While O
forgeries O
and O
sabotage O
were O
the O
highest O
principle O
for O
the O
latter O
, O
Eppstein B-PERS
was O
an O
overly O
correct O
devoted O
servant O
. O

While O
the O
latter O
consciously O
and O
consistently O
concentrated O
all O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
on O
themselves O
and O
never O
passed O
it O
on O
, O
Eppstein B-PERS
was O
a O
tyrant O
towards O
his O
employees O
and O
constantly O
tried O
to O
keep O
the O
entire O
apparatus O
under O
pressure O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
appear O
unobjective O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
friends O
of O
Eppstein B-PERS
, O
who O
knew O
his O
life O
, O
try O
to O
excuse O
his O
attitude O
as O
follows O
. O

It O
would O
allegedly O
be O
his O
completely O
different O
lifestyle O
, O
his O
Prussian O
correctness O
, O
which O
was O
so O
immersed O
in O
him O
that O
he O
could O
not O
be O
anything O
other O
than O
correct O
even O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
; O
this O
may O
explain O
some O
things O
, O
but O
not O
excuse O
them O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
it O
is O
the O
same O
problem O
as O
that O
of O
the O
entire O
German O
people O
. O

Today O
we O
cannot O
excuse O
the O
slaughter O
and O
devastation O
of O
almost O
all O
of O
Europe B-LOC
because O
it O
was O
ordered O
and O
commanded O
. O

In O
this O
context O
it O
is O
immaterial O
to O
judge O
how O
far O
Eppstein B-PERS
was O
guilty O
of O
the O
almost O
simultaneous O
death O
of O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
who O
were O
shot O
in O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
. O

His O
guilt O
is O
more O
of O
a O
negative O
one O
and O
consists O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
people O
who O
were O
already O
well O
informed O
at O
the O
time O
, O
participating O
in O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
comedy O
and O
not O
even O
clearly O
pointing O
out O
the O
danger O
. O

How O
great O
is O
the O
guilt O
towards O
the O
whole O
collective O
and O
how O
must O
it O
have O
looked O
in O
a O
person O
who O
knew O
for O
years O
that O
the O
people O
and O
friends O
around O
him O
would O
go O
to O
gas O
death O
and O
that O
he O
could O
be O
as O
silent O
as O
the O
grave O
for O
years O
. O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
Murmelstein B-PERS
, O
who O
is O
basically O
the O
same O
type O
, O
even O
more O
brutal O
and O
dirty O
in O
form O
. O

The O
pressure O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
grew O
ever O
stronger O
, O
and O
the O
practices O
of O
Eppstein B-PERS
, O
Murmelstein B-PERS
and O
their O
accomplices O
became O
increasingly O
intolerable O
. O

And O
the O
gap O
between O
this O
circle O
and O
people O
like O
Edelstein B-PERS
and O
Friedmann B-PERS
got O
deeper O

the O

building O
in O

in O
which O
a O
hospital O

been O
established O

The O
largest O

was O
converted O
into O
a O
concert O
hall O
and O
the O
high O
point O
of O
the O
festivities O
was O
a O
concert O
to O
mark O
the O
inauguration O
of O
the O
hall O

The O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
orchestra O
had O
to O
be O
ordered O
by O
Dr O

Eppstein B-PERS
to O
perform O
the O
Ninth O
Symphony O
( O
Ode O
to O
Joy O
) O
by O
Beethoven B-PERS

This O
concert O
was O
only O
for O
invited O
guests O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
elite O
of O
the O
camp O
should O
take O
part O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
received O
the O
official O
invitation O
and O
sent O
it O
back O
with O
the O
remark O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
attend O
. O

He O
then O
received O
another O
invitation O
from O
management O
and O
a O
direct O
invitation O
from O
Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
. O

Although O
he O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
danger O
of O
this O
affront O
due O
to O
the O
tense O
mood O
, O
he O
was O
under O
no O
circumstances O
willing O
to O
participate O
in O
this O
undignified O
comedy O
. O

He O
took O
the O
position O
that O
he O
lived O
as O
a O
private O
person O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
that O
no O
one O
could O
force O
him O
to O
take O
part O
in O
things O
that O
he O
was O
against O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
obligation O
to O
represent O
in O
any O
way O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
did O
not O
attend O
the O
concert O
. O

This O
happened O
a O
few O
days O
before O
the O
transports O
, O
to O
which O
he O
was O
then O
assigned O
as O
a O
special O
inmate O

Out O
of O
the O
blue O

so O
to O
speak O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
these O
festivities O
, O
3 O
transports O
of O
2,500 O
people O
were O
dispatched O
to O
the O
east O
in O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
. O

The O
night O
before O
the O
last O
transport O
was O
disconnected O
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
called O
to O
Eppstein B-PERS
and O
was O
given O
the O
task O
of O
preparing O
for O
the O
transport O
. O

Dr O
. O

Eppstein B-PERS
explained O
to O
Friedmann B-PERS
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
the O
exact O
motive O
for O
the O
sudden O
deportation O
, O
but O
the O
commandant O
's O
office O
had O
indicated O
to O
him O
that O
this O
transport O
would O
not O
go O
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
but O
to O
a O
new O
labour O
camp O
near O
Dresden B-LOC
, O
which O
Friedmann B-PERS
was O
entrusted O
with O
building O
. O

This O
harmful O
comedy O
was O
not O
only O
performed O
in O
front O
of O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
but O
also O
spread O
through O
whispered O
propaganda O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
ghetto I-GHETTO
and O
thus O
consciously O
exploited O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
popularity O
to O
raise O
the O
mood O
. O

Despite O
this O
apparently O
great O
staging O
, O
they O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
faith O
in O
Friedmann B-PERS
's I-PERS
good O
faith O
. O

They O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
on O
to O
their O
tricks O
like O
hardly O
anyone O
else O
and O
were O
probably O
afraid O
that O
he O
would O
disappear O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
. O

He O
was O
therefore O
arrested O
on O
the O
same O
day O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
the O
bunker O
and O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
assembly O
point O
early O
under O
police O
guard O
. O

He O
drove O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
in O
a O
normal O
transport O
car O
with O
another O
30 O
transport O
participants O
. O

However O
, O
just O
on O
the O
next O
stop O
he O
was O
taken O
by O
SS O
- O
man O
Heindl B-PERS
from O
the O
car O
and O
driven O
from O
there O
on O
in O
a O
special O
car O
under O
surveillance O
by O
said O
SS O
- O
man O
and O
three O
German B-LOC
policemen O
. O

Auschwitz B-CAMP
The O
entire O
incoming O
transport O
came O
to O
the O
notorious O
family O
camp O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
also O
originally O
admitted O
to O
this O
camp O
, O
again O
with O
special O
security O
and O
was O
again O
in O
prison O
in O
the O
block O
of O
the O
orderly O
room O
( O
camp O
administration O
) O
. O

However O
, O
since O
there O
was O
nothing O
left O
to O
lose O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
and O
there O
was O
little O
compliance O
with O
the O
regulations O
, O
we O
were O
in O
constant O
contact O
with O
Friedmann B-PERS
during O
the O
3 O
days O
he O
was O
detained O
in O
this O
camp O
. O

The O
orders O
that O
changed O
almost O
every O
hour O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
headquarters O
regarding O
his O
person O
were O
completely O
mysterious O
to O
the O
camp O
management O
. O

In O
the O
first O
hours O
it O
was O
stated O
that O
he O
should O
not O
be O
tattooed O
in O
this O
camp O
because O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
transferred O
into O
the O
men O
's O
concentration O
camp O
. O

The O
next O
day O
it O
was O
said O
that O
he O
was O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
a O
normal O
prisoner O
in O
the O
family O
camp O
, O
and O
suddenly O
the O
order O
came O
to O
transfer O
him O
to O
the O
men O
's O
camp O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
was O
fully O
aware O
of O
his O
situation O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
. O

When O
we O
spoke O
to O
him O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
he O
said O
, O
this O
time O
with O
a O
little O
bitter O
humor O
, O
now O
I've O
lost O
the O
game O
. O

His O
calm O
, O
his O
superiority O
, O
his O
clear O
disposition O
and O
even O
his O
patience O
with O
the O
confusion O
and O
panic O
of O
the O
surroundings O
was O
more O
admirable O
than O
ever O
. O

It O
was O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
21 B-DATE
May I-DATE
1944 I-DATE
that O
the O
men O
’s O
concentration O
camp O
inmates O
were O
instructed O
to O
come O
to O
the O
punishment O
block O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
block O
early O
with O
his O
fellow O
inmates O
in O
a O
commando O
, O
that O
is O
, O
in O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
language O
to O
work O
. O

The O
capo O
of O
the O
commando O
had O
the O
order O
to O
lead O
him O
beyond O
the O
chain O
of O
posts O
and O
refused O
. O

Then O
an O
SS O
- O
man O
took O
Friedmann B-PERS
out O
that O
several O
steps O
further O
than O
was O
the O
limit O
for O
prisoners O
. O

He O
was O
shot O
from O
behind O
. O

A O
detailed O
protocol O
with O
a O
description O
and O
drawing O
of O
his O
escape O
attempt O
was O
drawn O
up O
with O
the O
title O
Shot O
while O
trying O
to O
escape O
. O

- O
- O
- O
During O
these O
two O
days O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, I-CAMP
we O
talked O
in O
peace O
about O
all O
the O
problems O
that O
this O
new O
situation O
resulted O
in O
. O

What O
preoccupied O
and O
tormented O
him O
most O
was O
who O
and O
how O
many O
had O
known O
the O
truth O
about O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

To O
describe O
the O
impression O
that O
5 O
chimneys O
burning O
day O
and O
night O
and O
the O
constant O
smell O
of O
burnt O
organic O
matter O
had O
to O
make O
on O
every O
normal O
person O
is O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
these O
considerations O
. O

He O
clearly O
asked O
himself O
what O
consequences O
of O
the O
event O
. O

knowledge O
of O
this O
monstrous O
thing O
could O
have O
had O
. O

He O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
could O
never O
have O
remained O
silent O
knowing O
that O
with O
his O
full O
signature O
or O
through O
any O
possible O
whispered O
propaganda O
he O
would O
have O
spread O
the O
truth O
in O
the O
camp O
and O
then O
would O
have O
disappeared O
. O

Despite O
the O
panic O
and O
chaos O
and O
the O
small O
possibility O
of O
rescue O
, O
even O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
full O
truth O
, O
nobody O
would O
have O
the O
right O
to O
keep O
this O
secret O
. O

He O
also O
believed O
that O
the O
individual O
would O
have O
had O
more O
chance O
to O
save O
himself O
even O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
fleeing O
and O
that O
even O
chaos O
and O
an O
event O
. O

uprising O
would O
have O
cost O
fewer O
victims O
than O
this O
unprecedented O
mass O
destruction O
. O

Friedmann B-PERS
said O
a O
lot O
in O
his O
clarity O
and O
truthfulness O
in O
this O
situation O
that O
was O
particularly O
shocking O
. O

One O
of O
these O
sayings O
is O
this O
: O
Later O
, O
when O
they O
speak O
of O
our O
time O
and O
our O
work O
, O
and O
if O
you O
are O
there O
, O
then O
tell O
the O
people O
that O
others O
may O
or O
probably O
have O
done O
better O
did O
than O
we O
did O
. O

But O
no O
one O
could O
have O
done O
it O
with O
cleaner O
hands O
and O
with O
a O
purer O
heart O
I O
wanted O
to O
convey O
this O
to O
the O
survivors O

The O
day O
we O
boarded O
the O
transport O
. O

We O
had O
already O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
same O
hardships O
and O
suffering O
that O
thousands O
and O
thousands O
of O
our O
sisters O
and O
brothers O
had O
gone O
through O
now O
awaited O
us O
. O

We O
didn’t O
know O
where O
they O
would O
take O
us O
, O
we O
only O
knew O
that O
it O
would O
be O
worse O
and O
far O
more O
terrible O
than O
what O
we O
had O
already O
experienced O
. O

We O
were O
ready O
for O
the O
transport O
. O

The O
same O
day O
that O
we O
marched O
past O
Rahm B-PERS
, O
we O
started O
to O
get O
our O
things O
ready O
and O
pack O
. O

We O
sorted O
, O
packed O
, O
and O
then O
sorted O
and O
packed O
some O
more O
. O

Practically O
the O
entire O
staff O
of O
the O
home O
was O
leaving O
, O
and O
so O
we O
also O
had O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
children O
. O

Our O
luggage O
and O
the O
things O
we O
wanted O
to O
take O
with O
us O
were O
finally O
ready O
. O

And O
we O
had O
a O
lot O
. O

We O
had O
planned O
for O
the O
eventuality O
that O
our O
luggage O
wouldn’t O
get O
there O
in O
one O
piece O
, O
or O
wouldn’t O
get O
there O
at O
all O
, O
and O
we O
took O
so O
many O
things O
with O
us O
we O
could O
barely O
move O
them O
. O

Winter O
is O
coming O
and O
we O
mustn’t O
go O
bare O
, O
we O
told O
ourselves O
and O
so O
we O
put O
on O
underwear O
, O
dresses O
, O
several O
blouses O
and O
sweaters O
, O
skirts O
, O
coats O
, O
and O
on O
top O
of O
all O
that O
, O
if O
we O
had O
one O
, O
a O
work O
suit O

Three O
pairs O
of O
socks O

warm O
socks O

lost O
, O
this O
would O
last O
us O
at O
least O
a O
year O
and O
then O
, O
God O
willing O
, O
hopefully O
, O
hopefully O
our O
suffering O
would O
end O
. O

We O
were O
finally O
ready O
and O
prepared O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
barracks O
. O

The O
train O
was O
ready O
. O

The O
remaining O
children O
loaded O
the O
luggage O
onto O
a O
cart O
and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
. O

There O
, O
we O
handed O
in O
our O
luggage O
and O
then O
went O
into O
the O
barracks O
. O

I O
wrote O
down O
my O
name O
and O
the O
number O
that O
was O
on O
the O
board O
hanging O
around O
my O
neck O
. O

Then O
we O
went O
upstairs O
into O
the O
reserved O
rooms O
. O

They O
were O
almost O
full O
. O

There O
were O
mostly O
women O
and O
children O
there O
. O

Mostly O
children O
, O
because O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
orphans O
were O
leaving O
with O
the O
remaining O
Jügendfürsorge O
staff O
. O

There O
are O
children O
of O
all O
ages O
. O

The O
smaller O
ones O
were O
with O
their O
caregivers O
. O

We O
were O
moved O
to O
tears O
. O

Not O
because O
of O
our O
plight O
, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
children O
whose O
fate O
was O
certain O
death O
. O

That O
night O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

I O
walked O
once O
more O
through O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
said O
goodbye O
to O
the O
places O
where O
life O
was O
hard O
, O
but O
we O
got O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
returned O
to O
the O
barracks O
and O
layed O
down O
, O
fully O
clothed O
, O
on O
my O
pallet O
to O
sleep O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O

At O
7 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
— O
boarding O
time O
. O

We O
entered O
basically O
according O
to O
our O
numbers O
. O

We O
had O
children O
from O
our O
home O
in O
our O
care O
, O
with O
whom O
we O
had O
experienced O
so O
much O
worry O
yet O
so O
much O
joy O
as O
well O
. O

They O
were O
about O
60 O
of O
them O
and O
some O
older O
foster O
children O
and O
their O
mothers O
were O
with O
us O
as O
well O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
persuade O
the O
Transportleitung O
to O
give O
us O
a O
carriage O
for O
the O
children O
and O
caregivers O
. O

At O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
they O
added O
several O
elderly O
people O
, O
who O
made O
our O
difficult O
trip O
even O
harder O
. O

There O
were O
71 O
of O
us O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
besides O
the O
suitcases O
, O
bags O
, O
and O
other O
luggage O
. O

We O
sat O
, O
tightly O
packed O
in O
, O
one O
right O
next O
to O
the O
other O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
, O
they O
left O
a O
little O
space O
for O
a O
bottle O
of O
water O
and O
a O
bucket O
. O

We O
departed O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
waited O
in O
Bohušovice B-LOC
for O
more O
people O
to O
board O
the O
transport O
and O
for O
departure O
. O

The O
carriage O
was O
a O
cattle O
car O
. O

They O
sealed O
the O
doors O
and O
wired O
the O
windows O
shut O
except O
for O
a O
small O
slit O
. O

It O
was O
extremely O
hot O
and O
humid O
in O
the O
carriage O
. O

We O
soon O
realized O
that O
we O
wouldn’t O
be O
able O
to O
breathe O
. O

The O
carriage O
was O
overcrowded O
with O
people O
, O
and O
the O
bucket O
, O
containing O
excrement O
that O
we O
couldn’t O
empty O
out O
, O
added O
to O
the O
oppressive O
air O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
train O
would O
stop O
, O
soldiers O
would O
patrol O
around O
it O
. O

We O
asked O
them O
if O
we O
could O
open O
the O
window O
a O
little O
. O

They O
didn’t O
allow O
it O
. O

We O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
help O
ourselves O
. O

By O
some O
coincidence O
, O
someone O
had O
a O
pair O
of O
pliers O
. O

While O
the O
train O
was O
in O
motion O
, O
we O
loosened O
the O
wires O
until O
we O
could O
finally O
open O
the O
window O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
train O
stopped O
, O
we O
pushed O
the O
window O
back O
into O
place O
and O
hid O
the O
wires O
so O
well O
that O
the O
patrol O
didn’t O
notice O
that O
they O
were O
loose O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
fool O
them O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

On O
the O
side O
where O
the O
children O
were O
sitting O
by O
the O
window O
and O
had O
done O
the O
same O
to O
it O
, O
the O
wire O
fell O
out O
of O
the O
window O
. O

The O
patrol O
found O
it O
and O
flew O
into O
a O
rage O
. O

We O
had O
to O
close O
the O
windows O
because O
they O
were O
threatening O
to O
shoot O
us O
. O

The O
air O
in O
the O
carriage O
was O
unbearable O
, O
and O
we O
opened O
the O
window O
again O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
train O
started O
moving O
. O

We O
finished O
the O
bottle O
of O
water O
( O
5 O
liters O
) O
that O
we O
had O
brought O
with O
us O
from O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

When O
the O
train O
would O
stop O
we O
would O
beg O
the O
SSmen O
to O
allow O
us O
to O
fetch O
some O
water O
somewhere O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
forbade O
it O
. O

The O
children O
in O
the O
carriage O
were O
crying O
because O
they O
were O
thirsty O
, O
and O
so O
we O
sat O
and O
entertained O
the O
children O
to O
help O
them O
forget O
. O

We O
began O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
time O
when O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
drink O
enough O
water O
, O
although O
we O
lacked O
so O
many O
other O
things O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
were O
overcome O
with O
nostalgia O
: O
Dear O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

There O
, O
we O
were O
at O
least O
allowed O
to O
drink O
water O
. O

After O
we’d O
been O
on O
the O
train O
for O
over O
24 O
hours O
, O
we O
turned O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
direction O
it O
was O
going O
in O
. O

We O
found O
out O
that O
we O
were O
going O
east O
. O

We O
saw O
Gleiwitz B-CAMP
, O
Hindenburg B-CAMP
, O
the O
edges O
of O
mines O
and O
factories O
. O

We O
guessed O
that O
we O
were O
headed O
for O
Birkenau B-CAMP
. O

In O
our O
imaginations O
, O
it O
was O
a O
ghetto O
, O
not O
as O
organized O
and O
perfect O
as O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
but O
still O
a O
ghetto O
, O
because O
we O
had O
received O
letters O
from O
there O
from O
our O
friends O
and O
relatives O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
our O
ride O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
Birkenau B-CAMP
station O
and O
our O
hearts O
skipped O
a O
beat O
out O
of O
happiness O
. O

We O
thought O
about O
our O
loved O
ones O
who O
were O
here O
. O

We O
imagined O
that O
we O
would O
see O
them O
, O
maybe O
some O
of O
them O
would O
be O
waiting O
at O
the O
station O
for O
us O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
when O
we O
rode O
through O
the O
station O
without O
stopping O
. O

We O
withheld O
this O
from O
the O
others O
to O
keep O
them O
calm O
. O

We O
rode O
through O
the O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
station O
. O

We O
looked O
through O
the O
slits O
of O
the O
window O
that O
we O
closed O
immediately O
afterwards O
because O
we O
expected O
the O
train O
to O
stop O
at O
any O
minute O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
sitting O
by O
the O
window O
were O
gripped O
with O
terror O
after O
reading O
the O
names O
of O
the O
stations O
, O
but O
we O
remained O
silent O
to O
keep O
the O
others O
from O
finding O
out O
. O

The O
train O
stopped O
and O
then O
started O
to O
move O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

It O
was O
completely O
quiet O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
but O
then O
someone O
suddenly O
said O
: O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

If O
a O
bomb O
had O
exploded O
, O
it O
couldn’t O
have O
set O
off O
a O
greater O
panic O
. O

The O
women O
wailed O
and O
cried O
; O
the O
men O
screamed O
. O

The O
children O
were O
terrified O
. O

We O
looked O
through O
the O
slits O
in O
the O
window O
. O

We O
saw O
a O
lit O
yard O
with O
buildings O
surrounded O
by O
an O
electric O
fence O
. O

Every O
5 O
meters O
there O
was O
an O
electric O
lamp O
. O

A O
concentration O
camp O
— O
electric O
fence O
. O

Lord O
, O
help O
us O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
anywhere O
except O
between O
these O
wires O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
run O
away O
, O
hide O
somewhere O
. O

But O
we O
couldn’t O
. O

We O
were O
locked O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
there O
were O
patrols O
outside O
who O
were O
shooting O
. O

The O
train O
stopped O
. O

It O
was O
quiet O
outside O
, O
we O
could O
only O
hear O
the O
patrols O
’ O
footsteps O
, O
and O
inside O
the O
carriage O
— O
darkness O
and O
sheer O
panic O
. O

Then O
we O
heard O
them O
opening O
the O
carriages O
next O
to O
ours O
, O
we O
heard O
Yiddish O
being O
spoken O
. O

Our O
hope O
surged O
when O
we O
saw O
that O
there O
were O
Jews O
there O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
an O
order O
: O
everything O
out O
, O
the O
luggage O
stays O
in O
the O
carriages O
. O

The O
men O
exited O
separately O
. O

We O
took O
the O
children O
by O
the O
hand O
and O
left O
the O
train O
. O

Women O
and O
children O
moved O
forward O
. O

An O
SSman O
stood O
at O
the O
crossing O
and O
waved O
his O
cane O
this O
way O
and O
that O
. O

And O
we O
saw O
people O
going O
either O
left O
or O
right O
depending O
on O
the O
direction O
he O
waved O
his O
cane O
in O
. O

Children O
and O
old O
people O
on O
one O
side O
, O
young O
people O
on O
the O
other O
. O

I O
finally O
came O
to O
stand O
before O
the O
SSman O
: O
Ist O
das O
ihr O
Kind O
? O
When O
I O
told O
him O
no O
, O
he O
asked O
me O
how O
old O
the O
child O
was O
and O
waved O
his O
cane O
to O
the O
right O
. O

As O
I O
went O
, O
I O
turned O
around O
to O
look O
for O
my O
sister O
. O

Thank O
God O
, O
she O
was O
behind O
me O
. O

They O
made O
us O
stand O
in O
5 O
rows O
and O
then O
we O
started O
walking O
. O

In O
about O
10 O
minutes O
, O
we O
veered O
off O
the O
path O
and O
found O
ourselves O
among O
a O
tangle O
of O
wires O
near O
brick O
buildings O
and O
a O
mound O
of O
luggage O
. O

We O
were O
eager O
and O
impatient O
and O
asked O
the O
SSman O
questions O
. O

He O
answered O
brusquely O
, O
but O
we O
managed O
to O
learn O
something O
. O

We O
would O
apparently O
be O
reunited O
with O
our O
families O
. O

But O
first O
we O
had O
to O
make O
our O
way O
immediately O
to O
the O
baths O
and O
our O
things O
had O
to O
be O
disinfected O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
a O
large O
, O
cold O
room O
. O

They O
took O
away O
our O
bread O
bags O
in O
which O
we O
had O
our O
last O
supply O
of O
food O
. O

There O
were O
women O
here O
as O
well O
, O
who O
were O
, O
unlike O
the O
men O
who O
were O
dressed O
in O
striped O
clothing O
and O
plate O
- O
shaped O
hats O
, O
dressed O
like O
civilians O
except O
that O
they O
had O
a O
red O
line O
on O
their O
backs O
. O

We O
weren’t O
wearing O
a O
Jewish O
star O
. O

Several O
SSmen O
enter O
, O
among O
them O
the O
one O
we O
knew O
from O
the O
train O
station O
. O

We O
were O
ordered O
to O
take O
off O
our O
clothes O
. O

We O
took O
off O
our O
coats O
and O
waited O
. O

They O
shouted O
at O
us O
to O
speed O
it O
up O
, O
the O
Obersturmführer O
was O
waiting O
. O

We O
protested O
and O
said O
that O
there O
were O
men O
in O
the O
room O
. O

They O
shouted O
and O
beat O
us O
. O

And O
so O
we O
had O
to O
strip O
off O
our O
clothes O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
keep O
our O
shoes O
, O
but O
not O
on O
our O
feet O
, O
we O
had O
to O
hold O
them O
in O
our O
hands O
. O

We O
stand O
in O
line O
in O
front O
of O
a O
bench O
where O
they O
removed O
our O
rings O
, O
watches O
, O
and O
jewels O
both O
valuable O
and O
worthless O
. O

We O
stood O
in O
rows O
, O
naked O
, O
and O
saw O
our O
things O
, O
which O
we O
had O
set O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
piles O
, O
being O
thrown O
around O
. O

The O
women O
and O
men O
who O
worked O
there O
flung O
themselves O
upon O
them O
like O
hyenas O
and O
picked O
off O
the O
things O
they O
needed O
. O

When O
we O
protested O
, O
they O
shouted O
at O
us O
and O
beat O
us O
and O
we O
realized O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
still O
belonged O
to O
us O
was O
our O
life O
. O

After O
we O
showered O
we O
would O
apparently O
get O
new O
clothing O
. O

We O
marched O
, O
undressed O
, O
before O
the O
SSman O
, O
who O
sent O
the O
weaker O
ones O
aside O
. O

In O
another O
room O
, O
they O
took O
away O
our O
hair O
clips O
and O
combs O
. O

There O
were O
several O
women O
there O
with O
shaving O
equipment O
. O

We O
thought O
they O
would O
cut O
some O
of O
our O
hair O
off O
for O
reasons O
of O
hygiene O
. O

A O
fat O
woman O
stood O
by O
the O
window O
talking O
with O
another O
dressed O
in O
an O
SS O
uniform O
. O

We O
saw O
SS O
women O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

One O
of O
the O
female O
employees O
asked O
her O
something O
. O

We O
heard O
: O
Alles O
herunter O
. O

And O
we O
saw O
the O
first O
in O
line O
get O
her O
head O
shaved O
, O
her O
hair O
falling O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

In O
a O
moment O
, O
a O
beautiful O
, O
cultured O
woman O
was O
transformed O
into O
something O
that O
resembled O
an O
ape O
. O

And O
so O
it O
went O
, O
one O
after O
another O
. O

After O
I O
was O
altered O
in O
this O
way O
, O
I O
looked O
around O
for O
my O
sister O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
not O
allowed O
, O
I O
walked O
around O
the O
room O
several O
times O
until O
I O
heard O
her O
voice O
. O

We O
went O
into O
another O
room O
to O
shower O
. O

We O
held O
our O
shoes O
in O
our O
hands O
like O
they O
were O
the O
most O
valuable O
thing O
, O
because O
they O
were O
the O
only O
things O
of O
ours O
that O
we O
had O
left O
. O

Several O
men O
and O
women O
had O
already O
tried O
to O
take O
them O
from O
us O
or O
exchange O
something O
for O
them O
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
take O
them O
from O
us O
. O

But O
we O
didn’t O
give O
them O
away O
. O

We O
still O
hoped O
that O
we O
could O
at O
least O
hold O
on O
to O
our O
shoes O
. O

So O
they O
wouldn’t O
get O
stolen O
, O
we O
took O
them O
with O
us O
to O
the O
showers O
. O

Better O
wet O
than O
not O
at O
all O
. O

We O
had O
no O
soap O
to O
wash O
ourselves O
with O
, O
nor O
towels O
to O
dry O
ourselves O
off O
. O

The O
water O
ran O
sometimes O
lukewarm O
and O
sometimes O
ice O
cold O
. O

We O
left O
the O
showers O
wet O
and O
stood O
in O
another O
cold O
room O
and O
waited O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

We O
were O
desperate O
, O
we O
were O
cold O
, O
we O
were O
devastated O
and O
powerless O
. O

And O
so O
we O
concentrated O
on O
what O
awaited O
us O
. O

Clothing O
. O

How O
ironic O
. O

They O
brought O
us O
a O
bag O
of O
rags O
. O

Dust O
billowed O
as O
they O
threw O
it O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
dresses O
, O
summer O
clothes O
, O
dirty O
and O
torn O
and O
not O
enough O
to O
cover O
our O
naked O
bodies O
. O

We O
supposedly O
didn’t O
need O
underwear O
. O

They O
also O
gave O
us O
coats O
, O
dirty O
, O
and O
either O
too O
big O
or O
too O
small O
, O
all O
torn O
. O

They O
originally O
didn’t O
want O
to O
give O
us O
socks O
. O

But O
we O
begged O
for O
them O
and O
they O
relented O
. O

But O
they O
purposefully O
gave O
us O
mismatched O
pairs O
. O

They O
paired O
a O
grey O
one O
with O
a O
black O
one O
, O
a O
white O
with O
a O
brown O
, O
etc O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
a O
dirty O
rag O
to O
cover O
our O
heads O
with O
. O

Instead O
of O
shoes O
, O
we O
got O
a O
pair O
of O
wooden O
slippers O
, O
each O
in O
a O
different O
size O
and O
of O
varying O
quality O
. O

Thus O
equipped O
, O
we O
entered O
another O
room O
, O
which O
we O
were O
told O
we’d O
be O
sleeping O
in O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
inside O
except O
for O
the O
cold O
stone O
floor O
. O

Tired O
as O
we O
were O
, O
we O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
but O
couldn’t O
sleep O
. O

We O
were O
freezing O
and O
lacked O
pants O
or O
a O
shirt O
. O

We O
were O
alone O
for O
a O
moment O
. O

Then O
some O
men O
entered O
, O
and O
we O
complained O
to O
them O
. O

Some O
do O
- O
gooders O
came O
forward O
who O
were O
willing O
to O
acquire O
clothes O
for O
us O
, O
but O
for O
a O
price O
that O
I O
can’t O
bring O
myself O
to O
discuss O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
some O
of O
us O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
this O
price O
. O

And O
so O
we O
witnessed O
terrible O
things O
that O
we O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
forget O
. O

For O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
, O
for O
a O
shirt O
or O
a O
pair O
of O
pants O
, O
for O
a O
cigarette O
, O
all O
things O
that O
were O
unattainable O
to O
us O
, O
they O
went O
into O
the O
bathrooms O
with O
the O
men O
. O

One O
of O
the O
bath O
employees O
guarded O
the O
doors O
. O

They O
returned O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
bread O
or O
an O
item O
of O
clothing O
. O

It O
was O
enough O
information O
for O
us O
to O
realize O
the O
situation O
we O
were O
in O
. O

We O
spent O
our O
first O
night O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
on O
a O
stone O
floor O
, O
in O
the O
dirt O
, O
cold O
, O
and O
exposed O
to O
prostitution O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
took O
us O
beyond O
the O
electric O
fence O
to O
other O
electric O
fences O
, O
where O
we O
went O
hungry O
and O
stood O
during O
roll O
calls O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
nights O
until O
they O
took O
us O
, O
physically O
and O
mentally O
destroyed O

through O
another O
selection O
, O
to O
Germany B-LOC

estimate O
of O
two O
hundred O
eighty O
four O
Jews O
wantonly O
killed O
in O
the O
slaughter O
house O
near O
the O
Jewish O
quarter O
is O
the O
most O
conservative O
in O
numbers O

He O
blamed O
primarily O
the O
savage O
Macedo O
Romanians O

otherwise O
known O
as O
Kutzovlachs O

But O
according O

up O

The O
slaughter O

certainly O
did O
figure O
in O

much O
as O
I O
have O
it O
indirectly O
from O
an O

that O
when O

sixty O

all O
skinned O

The O
quantity O
of O
blood O
about O
would O

indicate O
that O
they O
had O

The O

You O
are O
in O
a O
waking O
dream O
: O
Is O
this O
all O
true O
? O
Is O
this O
possible O

Around O
them O
the O
barbed O

: O
criminals O
, O
yes O
, O
they O

stamped O

Now O
they O

what O
they O
feared O

Gone O
is O
the O
dream O
of O
all O
the O
beauty O
that O
they O
still O
possessed O

Now O
just O
do O
not O
think O
about O
mother O
, O
away O
, O
far O
away O
with O
those O

They O
feel O

their O

the O

of O
their O

They O
only O
think O

God O

Then O

the O

And O
he O
plows O

Then O
off O

3000 O

The O

I O

Soon O

Suddenly O

The O

Take O
everything O
off O

Nothing O
may O
be O
taken O
into O
the O

They O
throw O
everything O

the O

of O
the O

, O
the O

everything O
on O

In O

Now O
they O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O

Dozens O
of O

Towels O
and O

are O
distributed O

They O
are O
toddling O

waiting O

A O

The O

Still O
no O

The O

The O

They O

The O

Gas O

I O
have O
to O

something O

to O
the O

I O
can O
already O
see O
him O
: O
Yes O
I O
see O
you O
. O

You O
are O
so O
indistinct O
, O
my O
eyes O
, O
what O
’s O
wrong O
with O
my O
eyes O
? O
The O
mother O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
stroke O
her O
, O
and O
she O
goes O
away O
from O
me O
. O

Farther O
away O
, O
I O
... O
mother O
... O
I O
do O
not O
see O
you O
anymore O
... O
So O
they O
die O
. O

3000 O
. O

We O
, O
the O
meager O
remnant O
of O
six O
million O
Jews O
, O
think O
of O
them O
and O
of O
those O
who O
died O
before O
and O
after O
them O
. O

The O
horror O
has O
marked O
us O
. O

We O
know O
about O
life O
and O
death O
. O

We O
rarely O
talk O
about O
it O
anymore O
, O
and O
the O
word O
family O
has O
become O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
shimmer O
of O
a O
distant O
, O
distant O
time O
. O

We O
smile O
again O
because O
we O
live O
. O

We O
see O
the O
sun O
, O
the O
spring O
but O
we O
remain O
lonely O
. O

We O
look O
at O
the O
people O
who O
marvel O
at O
us O
and O
some O
who O
advertise O
us O
, O
they O
do O
not O
understand O
us O
. O

We O
remain O
lonely O

Our O

, O
was O
housed O
on O
a O
block O
that O
was O
already O
fully O
occupied O
with O
600 O
people O
. O

We O
were O
packed O
into O
the O

Each O
block O
had O
four O

There O
were O
no O
straw O

no O

only O
a O

Most O
of O

our O

Lack O

hard O

and O
the O

the O

of O
our O
friends O
were O
among O
the O
victims O
of O
the O
Litoměřice B-LOC
concentration O
camp O
, O
including O
Heinz B-PERS
Schuster I-PERS
and O
Gert B-PERS
Körbel I-PERS
. O

As O
I O
previously O
stated O
, O
the O
work O
day O
was O
12 O
hours O
long O
. O

Work O
was O
very O
hard O
, O
underground O
, O
and O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
loading O
rocks O
and O
other O
backbreaking O
work O
. O

There O
wasn’t O
enough O
food O
, O
we O
got O
40 O
dkg O
of O
bread O
per O
day O
, O
1 O
liter O
of O
thin O
soup O
, O
and O
minuscule O
so O
- O
called O
Zulagen O
, O
much O
less O
than O
in O
the O
Kaufering B-CAMP
concentration O
camp O
. O

Their O
treatment O
of O
us O
was O
also O
very O
bad O
, O
although O
we O
interacted O
very O
little O
with O
the O
SS O
. O

But O
when O
the O
SS O
did O
interfere O
, O
it O
was O
horrible O
. O

The O
SS O
had O
trained O
dogs O
, O
which O
they O
turned O
on O
the O
prisoners O
. O

It O
was O
mostly O
the O
capos O
and O
head O
workers O
who O
would O
beat O
prisoners O
and O
beat O
them O
to O
death O
. O

The O
Poles B-LOC
( O
Aryans O
) O
were O
especially O
cruel O
and O
had O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
attitudes O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
Aryan O
prisoners O
, O
only O
some O
of O
the O
political O
prisoners O
treated O
us O
well O
, O
especially O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

In O
April B-DATE
, O
the O
camp O
was O
slowly O
liquidated O
, O
and O
the O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

I O
was O
on O

of O
these O

After O
much O
deliberation O
and O
internal O
discussions O
, O
several O
leaders O
and O
chefs O
of O
food O
stalls O
, O
bakeries O
, O
white O
bakeries O
, O
butcher O
shops O
, O
in O
short O
the O
so O
- O
called O
nutritious O
establishments O
of O
the O
ghetto O
, O
decided O
to O
give O
their O
staff O
a O
regular O
and O
organic O
unofficial O
- O
official O
allotment O
of O
food O
. O

It O
continues O
to O
be O
questioned O
whether O
this O
was O
done O
in O
recognition O
of O
the O
really O
great O
amount O
of O
physical O
labour O
involved O
, O
or O
in O
order O
to O
stop O
the O
increasingly O
horrendous O
and O
widespread O
Schleussen O
/ O
see O
also O
: O
stealing O
, O
as O
this O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
recognized O
in O
the O
Civil O
Penal O
Code O
/. O
In O
any O
case O
, O
this O
was O
a O
tribute O
in O
the O
most O
literal O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
, O
by O
which O
the O
aforementioned O
leaders O
wanted O
to O
control O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
raw O
materials O
and O
the O
finished O
product O
, O
measure O
their O
personal O
consumption O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
deal O
with O
the O
Business O
Division O
, O
which O
trusted O
their O
professional O
expertise O
, O
to O
address O
the O
mythic O
loss O
percentage O
between O
the O
raw O
materials O
and O
the O
finished O
product O
. O

The O
Schleussen O
was O
therefore O
really O
no O
longer O
needed O
. O

The O
staff O
were O
able O
to O
use O
this O
allocation O
to O
cover O
their O
private O
needs O
/ O
parents O
, O
relatives O
, O
friends O
, O
etc./. O
But O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
the O
cat O
does O
not O
leave O
the O
mouse O
alone O
. O

So O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
some O
gangster O
types O
were O
not O
content O
with O
their O
assigned O
quantum O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
tempting O
and O
very O
attractive O
to O
make O
it O
on O
one O
's O
own O
or O
in O
ghetto O
jargon O
, O
thicken O
oneself O
. O

After O
all O
/since O
you O
can O
afford O
it/ O
you O
might O
permit O
yourself O
to O
enjoy O
and O
buy O
a O
few O
luxury O
items O
, O
cigarettes O
, O
suits O
, O
shoes O
, O
women O
, O
etc O
. O

? O
Thus O
, O
from O
the O
elements O
mentioned O
, O
regular O
Schleuss O
gangs O
and O
organizations O
formed O
, O
which O
endangered O
the O
operation O
of O
some O
businesses O
due O
to O
their O
unrestrained O
manner O
. O

With O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
economic O
police O
, O
the O
inspection O
of O
all O
nutritious O
establishments O
by O
professionals O
, O
the O
placement O
of O
guards O
in O
front O
of O
the O
entrances O
and O
exits O
of O
establishments O
, O
who O
had O
the O
task O
of O
felting O
all O
the O
people O
exiting O
of O
the O
same O
, O
i.e O
. O

to O
carry O
out O
a O
body O
search O
, O
Schleuss O
gangs O
faced O
their O
first O
real O
test O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
however O
, O
they O
overcame O
and O
managed O
, O
with O
really O
, O
sometimes O
ingenious O
ideas O
, O
to O
continue O
to O
maintain O
their O
dubious O
sources O
of O
income O
. O

Thus O
, O
for O
example O
, O
it O
was O
not O
an O
infrequent O
occurrence O
that O
the O
kitchen O
heater O
deliberately O
threw O
glowing O
slag O
into O
the O
ash O
bunker O
/which O
was O
connected O
with O
the O
kitchen O
by O
an O
ash O
trap/ O
then O
, O
armed O
with O
extinguishing O
water O
, O
shouting O
that O
the O
ash O
bunker O
was O
burning O
, O
but O
mainly O
packed O
to O
the O
teeth O
with O
various O
foods O
, O
passed O
the O
kitchen O
police O
outside O
on O
their O
way O
to O
comfortably O
empty O
the O
loot O
into O
the O
already O
- O
ready O
pockets O
or O
backpacks O
of O
his O
accomplices O
. O

Someone O
came O
to O
work O
one O
day O
with O
high O
rubber O
boots O
. O

He O
did O
not O
take O
them O
off O
despite O
the O
insane O
heat O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

And O
he O
did O
this O
only O
to O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
his O
friends O
the O
next O
day O
that O
he O
had O
hidden O
8 O
kg O
of O
yeast O
dough O
in O
them O
and O
that O
the O
softness O
of O
the O
fermenting O
dough O
had O
almost O
aroused O
the O
suspicion O
of O
the O
Kripo B-ORG
officer I-ORG
on O
duty O
. O

So O
, O
as O
is O
evident O
, O
there O
were O
also O
people O
who O
did O
the O
Schleusse O
for O
sport O
. O

Cooked O
- O
out O
beef O
bones O
were O
transported O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
in O
large O
boxes O
, O
forming O
the O
cover O
for O
large O
Schleusse O
hidden O
underneath O
. O

The O
helpful O
kitchen O
policeman O
usually O
helped O
lift O
these O
sufficiently O
heavy O
boxes O
, O
which O
were O
subsequently O
removed O
by O
the O
attached O
transport O
column O
. O

The O
central O
butchery O
and O
smokehouse O
of O
the O
Jewish O
self O
- O
government O
in O
Theresienstadt O
had O
its O
own O
company B-ORG
criminal I-ORG
police I-ORG
, O
which O
also O
acted O
as O
a O
transportation O
and O
disguise O
crew O
for O
larger O
and O
smaller O
meat O
or O
sausage O
Schleusse O
and O
was O
compensated O
accordingly O
. O

The O
courtyard O
of O
the O
butchery O
is O
surrounded O
by O
the O
fronts O
of O
two O
houses O
. O

The O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
first O
floor O
thereof O
were O
often O
surprised O
by O
the O
juicy O
pieces O
of O
meat O
or O
sausage O
which O
they O
found O
on O
the O
corridor O
floor O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

By O
way O
of O
explanation O
, O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
these O
meaty O
blessings O
were O
Schleusse O
that O
had O
been O
forgotten O
or O
were O
not O
picked O
up O
, O
practiced O
by O
a O
crafty O
rascal O
who O
had O
lifted O
them O
from O
the O
dangerous O
courtyard O
of O
the O
butchery O
to O
the O
first O
floor O
of O
the O
neighboring O
houses O
, O
where O
he O
could O
transport O
them O
away O
without O
risk O
. O

Meat O
was O
hidden O
in O
an O
exemplary O
fashion O
, O
until O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
female O
Kripo B-ORG
, O
within O
the O
more O
or O
less O
filled O
- O
out O
folds O
of O
the O
female O
butcher O
staff O
’ O
s O
clothing O
. O

So O
some O
days O
one O
saw O
women O
’s O
bodies O
that O
had O
been O
angular O
the O
day O
before O
floating O
about O
with O
a O
chubby O
roundedness O
. O

Bread O
and O
pastries O
were O
usually O
hidden O
in O
Schleuss O
bags O
in O
suits O
or O
dresses O
and O
smuggled O
out O
of O
the O
bakery O
. O

A O
loaf O
of O
bread O
is O
tied O
horizontally O
along O
the O
spine O
, O
the O
coat O
draped O
over O
it O
as O
camouflage O
, O
and O
already O
one O
can O
withstand O
a O
fleeting O
body O
search O
. O

The O
most O
solid O
nutritious O
establishment O
was O
allegedly O
the O
Central O
Provider O
, O
which O
supplied O
all O
other O
operations O
with O
raw O
materials O
. O

This O
operation O
experienced O
the O
fewest O
Schleusen O
exposures O
which O
enabled O
good O
theft O
with O
the O
same O
results O
as O
above O
. O

Here O
, O
they O
only O
engaged O
in O
wholesale O
Schleuss O
and O
that O
mostly O
on O
the O
open O
road O
. O

The O
car O
stops O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
, O
dark O
figures O
seize O
the O
already O
prepared O
packages O
or O
boxes O
and O
disappear O
in O
the O
nearest O
house O
. O

One O
could O
easily O
fill O
an O
average O
- O
sized O
book O
with O
stories O
about O
the O
Schleuss O
. O

This O
is O
of O
course O
a O
special O
description O

not O
a O
general O
one O

According O
to O
recognized O
statistics O
, O
the O
percentage O
of O
unreliable O
and O
dishonest O
employees O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
nutritious O
professions O
was O
10 O
% O
to O
20 O
% O
, O
and O
another O
30 O
% O
engaged O
in O
smaller O
enrichments O
for O
their O
own O
personal O
use O
. O

The O
moral O
problem O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
many O
mess O
halls O
people O
worked O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
with O
the O
Germans O
and O
that O
the O
thefts O
were O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
Germans O
and O
not O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
ghetto O
administration O
fought O
against O
these O
dangers O
to O
the O
general O
public O
in O
different O
periods O
of O
time O
with O
greater O
or O
lesser O
success O
and O
one O
can O
say O
, O
in O
line O
with O
the O
psychological O
analysis O
, O
that O
crime O
increases O
with O
hunger O
and O
falls O
with O
prosperity O

The O

the O
