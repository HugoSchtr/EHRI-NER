I O
must O
say O
that O
my O
impression O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
rule O
becomes O
more O
pessimistic O
each O
time O
. O

Namely O
, O
the O

in O
the O
German B-TER
- I-TER
occupied I-TER
areas I-TER
, O
under O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
, O
deteriorates O
more O
and O
more O
. O

The O
high O

policies O
of O
the O
German O
authorities B-TER
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
complex O
economic B-TER

, O
are O
fanning O
anti O

the O

However O
, O
on O
the O

its O
pace O
is O
extremely O
slow O

there O
is O
nothing O

drawn O
up O

move O

under O
the O
General B-TER

given O
the O
abundant O
labor B-TER

and O
the O
superior O
organizational O
capacity O
of O
the O
authorities B-TER

the O
efforts O
should O
bear O
fruit O

At O

Its O
ultimate O
political O
objective O
appears O
to O
be O
erasing O
Polishness O

or O
at O
least O
preventing O
Poles B-TER
from O
becoming O
a O
political O
force O
in O
the O

. O

This O
is O
done O
through O
depriving O

of O

identity I-TER

destroying O

The O

sent O
to O
Germany B-LOC

the O
compulsory B-TER

their O
tragedy O

a O

As O

Currently O

approximately O
two O

under O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
. O

The O
authorities B-TER
are O
taking O
a O
cautious O
consideration O
in O
dealing O
with O
them O
. O

Namely O
, O
initially O
they O
were O
to O
be O
concentrated B-TER
in O
certain O
parts O
( O
Lublin B-LOC
District O
) O
so O
as O
to O
be O
cut O
off O
from O
interactions O
with O
the O
German O
and O
Polish O
peoples B-TER
. O

Due O
to O
technical O
difficulties O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
success O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
policy B-TER
of O
local O
( O
settlement O

was O
adopted O
, O
so O
as O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
in O
their O
current O
areas O

inhabitance O
. O

The O
law B-TER
forbidding O
Jews B-TER
to O
use O
the O
railway B-TER
, O
enacted O
on O
January O
26 O
, O
1940 O
, O
is O
an O
affirmation O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
local O
rule O
. O

However O
, O
Jews B-TER
were O
expelled O
from O
Krakow B-LOC
( O
August O
1940 O
) O
. O

It O
appeared O
like O
the O
principle O
of O
local O
illegible O
was O
to O
be O
abandoned O
. O

However O
, O
no O
further O
development O
has O
happened O
till O
the O
present O

In O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
a O
relatively O
high O
concentration B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
live O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC

Radom B-LOC
, O
Lublin B-LOC
and O
other O
major O
cities O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
areas O
are O
completed O
cut B-TER
off I-TER
from O
the O
rest O

The O
authorities B-TER
set O
up O
administrative O
units O
called O
Judenrat B-TER
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

By O
controlling O
the O
masses O
through O
Judenrat B-TER
the O
authorities B-TER
seek O
to O
simplify O
their O
rule O
. O

These O
Judenrat B-TER
are O
based O
on O
the O
Law B-TER
establishing O
Judenrat B-TER
, O
promulgated B-TER
on O
November O
28 O
, O
1940 O
. O

The O
content O
of O
this O
law B-TER
is O
as O
follows O
: O
Through O
its O
Chairman B-TER
and I-TER
Vice I-TER
Chairmen I-TER
, O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
is O
obliged O
to O
follow O
orders O
from O
the O
German O
Authorities B-TER
; O
it O
is O
also O
responsible O
for O
fully O

these O
orders O

Jews B-TER
must O
faithfully O
follow O
orders O
issued O
by O
Judenrat B-TER
so O
as O
to O
implement O
the O
orders O
from O
the O
German O
Authorities O
. O

Although O

vary O
in O
size O
from O

they O
generally O
have O
the O
following O

that O
the O

vitiate O
the O
effects O

[ O

Many O
see O
in O
the O
presenting O
of O
this O
drastic O
bill B-TER
a O
clever O
move O
by O
Imrédy B-PER
to O
steal O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
National I-ORG
Socialists I-ORG
, O
to O
produce O
per O
se O
a O
revulsion O
to O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
sentiment O
( O
because O
in O
wide O
circles O
it O
is O
considered O
un- O
Hungarian B-TER
and O
unfair O
) O
, O
and O
to O
make O
Hungary B-LOC
unattractive O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
neighboring O
countries O
who O
would O
flee B-TER
to O
it O
as O
a O
haven O
from O
persecution B-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
the O
last O
analysis O
, O
many O
responsible O
Hungarians B-TER
are O
wondering O
what O
will O
become O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
especially O
the O
poorer O
ones O
, O
when O
they O
are O
deprived B-TER
of B-TER
their I-TER
means I-TER
of I-TER
livelihood I-TER
. O

They O
feel O
that O
the O
Government B-TER
is O
making O
a O
huge O
problem O
for O
itself O
by O
accelerating O
this O
problem O
without O
sufficient O
preparation O
. O

The O
German B-TER
Minister I-TER
told O
me O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
possible O
for O
the O
Hungarians B-TER
to O
carry O
on O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
policy B-TER
as O
they O
conceived O
it O
because O
, O
unlike O
Germany B-TER
, O
there O
were O
no O
skilled O
Gentiles B-TER
to O
replace O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

” O
A O
revivication O
of O
the O
Iron O
Guardmovement O
did O
not O
eventuate O
; O
rather O
, O
the O
legionary O
leaders O
have B-TER
been I-TER
shot I-TER
and O
the O
movement B-TER
’s I-TER
strength O
, O
both O
actual O
and O
potential O
, O
is O
greatly O
diminished O
. O

But O
the O
Nazi B-TER
shadow O
still O
looms O
large O
. O

Whether O
the O
German B-TER
threat B-TER
is O
a O
controlling O
or O
only O
a O
contributory O
factor O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
plight O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
this O
country O
has O
grown O
worse O
and O
their O
fears B-TER
are O
greatly O
increased O
. O

The O
Government B-TER
can O
scarcely O
be O
called O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
Goga B-PER
Government B-TER
a O
year O
ago O
, O
strongly O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
, O
but O
it O
‘ O
recognizes O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
’ O
and O
many O
are O
constrained O
to O
feel O
that O
although O
the O
Goga B-PER
and O
Cuza B-PER
program O
was O
openly O
and O
violently O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
the O
actual O
effect O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
and O
methods O
employed O
by O
the O
present O
regime B-TER
is O
more O
severe O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
out O
- O
and O
- O
out O
pogrom B-TER
and O
that O
Governmental B-TER
regulation B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
is O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
relatively O
slight O
, O
but O
pressure O
, O
obstacles O
, O
discriminations B-TER
– O
all O
of O
these O
forms O
of O
persecution B-TER
are O
becoming O
noticeably O
more O
numerous O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
attitude B-TER
of O
the O
Romanian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
, O
then O
, O
that O
this O
surplus O
population B-TER
of O
non B-TER
- I-TER
citizen I-TER
Jews B-TER
must O
go O
; O
there O
is O
to O
be O
no O
pogrom B-TER
, O
no O
violence O
, O
no O
brutality O
, O
but O
they B-TER
must I-TER
go I-TER
. O

Until O
a O
place O
is O
found O
for O
them O
and O
an O
arrangement O
is O
made O
for O
them O
to O
get O
there O
they O
will O
probably O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

As O
to O
the O
others O
, O
the O
800,000 O
who O
have O
established O
their O
citizenship B-TER
, O
the O
Government B-TER
points O
to O
their O
citizenship B-TER
as O
a O
guarantee O
of O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
accorded O
to O
others O
, O
although O
admitting O
that O
Jews B-TER
‘ O
will O
probably O
not O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
higher B-TER
positions I-TER
’ O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Romanians B-TER
are O
not O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
a O
harsh O
or O
vindictive O
people B-TER
; O
they O
are O
, O
rather O
, O
tolerant O
and O
easy O
- O
going O
. O

I O
feel O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
although O
the O
program O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
what O
are O
termed O
the O
‘ O
surplus O
’ O
Jews B-TER
will O
probably O
in O
any O
case O
be O
retained O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
likelihood O
of O
such O
a O
degree O
of O
violence O
or O
severity O
being O
employed O
as O
would O
call O
down O
strong O

dated O
December O

1938 O
, O
which O
in O
the O

paragraph O

mentions O
the O
growing O
tendency O
among O
certain O
politicians O
to O

Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER

and O
to O
report O
that O
this O

In O

at O
the O

of O
the O

of O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
early O
in O
December O
, O
Deputy O

informed O
the O

that O
he O
had O
worked O
out O
a O
concrete O
proposal O
embodying O
anti B-TER

Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER
which O
he O
wished O
to O
present O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Deputy O
Stoch B-PER
project O
is O
based O
not O
so O
much O
on O
racial B-TER
but O
on O
religious B-TER
principles I-TER
and O
proposes O
the O
extension O
of O
only O
temporary O
citizenship O
[ O
sic O
] O
to O
all O
professed O
Jews B-TER
, O
including O
even O
those O
who O
changed O
their O
religion B-TER
as O
far O
back O
as O
1918 O
. O

Under O
his O
project O
these O
temporary O
citizens O
would O
lose B-TER
: O
Their O
political B-TER
rights I-TER
, O
Employment B-TER
in I-TER
public I-TER
service I-TER
institutions I-TER
and O
schools B-TER
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
Jewish B-TER
private I-TER

organs I-TER
, O
Right O
to O

Furthermore O
the O

provides O
that O

by O
Jews B-TER

Christianity I-TER
before O
the O
restoration O
of O
Poland B-LOC

independence O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Jews B-TER
having O
special O
merits O
because O
of O

560 O
of O
January O
24 O
, O
1938 O
( O
Anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
Legislation I-TER
) O
, O
it O
is O
still O
true O
, O
as O
was O
then O
the O
case O
, O
that O
the O
Polish B-LOC
Government B-TER
feels O
that O
the O
time O
is O
not O
ripe O
yet O
for O
the O
enactment O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER
as O
such O
. O

However O
, O
the O
significant O
point O
in O
this O
report O
is O
that O
the O
tendency O
and O
trend O
of O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
is O
in O
that O
direction O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
Government O
still O
endeavors O
to O
side O
- O
step O
the O
main O
issue O
, O
but O
working O
through O
OZON B-ORG
, O
continues O
its O
policy B-TER
of O
guarded O
discrimination B-TER
, O
limiting O
Jewish B-TER
activity O
wherever O
possible O
without O
direct O
racial B-TER
reference O
. O

Temporizing O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
the O
Government B-TER
hopes O
to O
avoid O
hostile O
foreign B-TER
censure I-TER
, O
placate O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
circles O
here O
, O
and O
not O
to O
arouse O
Jewish O
apprehension O
or O
enmity O
. O

The O
Government B-TER
is O
under O
no O
illusion O
, O
however O
, O
but O
that O
eventually O
this O
issue O
will O
have O
to O
be O
faced O
squarely O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
characteristic O
of O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
where O
nationality B-TER
is O
a O
matter O
of O
language O
rather O
than O
of O
blood O
, O
that O
speech O
rather O
than O
origin O
is O
the O
distinguishing O
characteristic O
of O
friend O
or O
foe O
. O

Such O
resentment O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
as O
exists O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
thus O
centers O
largely O
on O
the O
German O
- O
speaking O
Jews B-TER
– O
particularly O
those O
who O
have O
come O
to O
Bohemia B-LOC
since O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Among O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
themselves O
, O
there O
is O
comparatively O
little O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitism I-TER
. O

Only O
the O
small O
Czech B-LOC
fascist B-TER
groups I-TER
and O
certain O
sections O
of O
the O
nationalist B-TER
- O
conservative B-TER
element O
are O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
. O

This O
applies O
particularly O
to O
the O
younger O
element O
in O
the O
New B-ORG
National I-ORG
Unity I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
being O
organized O
as O
a O
government B-TER
party B-TER
. O

All O
these O
elements O
together O
, O
however O
, O
make O
up O
only O
a O
small O
minority B-TER
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
population O
. O

The O
mass O
of O
the O
people O
appear O
simply O
to O
have O
very O
little O
interest O
in O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitism I-TER
. O

The O
present O
talk O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
and O
the O
general O
anxiety B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
is O
due O
principally O
to O
the O
pressure O
which O
is O
being O
brought O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Government B-TER
by O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
policy I-TER
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
pressure O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Very O
little O
has O
happened O
in O
Prague B-LOC
thus O
far O
to O
justify O
the O
panicky O
atmosphere O
which O
has O
prevailed O
in O
Jewish B-TER
circles I-TER
here O
since O
the O
Munich O
agreement O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
Moravia B-LOC
have O
remained O
up O
to O
the O
present O
quite O
unmolested O
both O
in O
their O
private O
lives O
and O
their O
economic B-TER
activities O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
Slovakia B-LOC
, O
other O
conditions O
prevail O
. O

Here O
the O
percentage O
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
is O
higher O
than O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
. O

The O
Slovak B-LOC
Jews B-TER
are O
not O
only O
prominent O
in O
the O
cities O
but O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
situation O
prevailing O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
are O
scattered O
in O
large O
numbers O
throughout O
the O
countryside O
and O
play O
a O
conspicuous O
part O
in O
the O
economic B-TER
life I-TER
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
village O
. O

They O
are O
the O
object O
of O
widespread O
resentment O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
population O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
are O
of O
the O
poorer O
orthodox B-TER
type O
. O

Their O
dress B-TER
, O
their O
manners O
and O
their O
habits O
are O
conspicuous O
and O
– O
to O
many O
Slovaks B-LOC
– O
offensive O
. O

They O
are O
prominent O
in O
the O
villages O
as O
money O
- O
lenders O
, O
lawyers B-TER
, O
saloon O
- O
keepers O
, O
druggists O
, O
merchants O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
larger O
cities O
they O
form O
a O
wealthy O
class O
which O
makes O
up O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
intelligentsia O
and O
controls O
a O
very O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
educated O
Jews B-TER
are O
Hungarian B-LOC
-speaking O
and O
have O
always O
looked O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
for O
cultural B-TER
inspiration O
. O

A O
smaller O
but O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
number O
have O
had O
a O
German B-LOC
cultural B-TER
orientation O
. O

This O
doubtless O
explains O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
feeling O
prevalent O
in O
many O
Slovak B-LOC
circles O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
have O
always O
sided O
with O
the O
oppressors O
of O
the O
Slovaks B-LOC
, O
against O
the O
native B-TER
population I-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
As O
will O
have O
been O
seen O
from O
the O
above O
discussion O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
presents O
a O
highly O
confused O
picture O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
themselves O
fall O
into O
many O
different O
categories O
, O
varying O
from O
the O
highly O
cultured B-TER
intellectuals B-TER
of O
Prague B-LOC
to O
the O
pious O
and O
primitive O
orthodox B-TER
Jews B-TER
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
and O
Ruthenian O
villages O
. O

They O
are O
divided O
among O
various O
cultural B-TER
tendencies O
: O
Yiddish O
, O
German B-LOC
, O
Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
. O

The O
attitude B-TER
of O
the O
Aryan B-TER
population O
toward O
them O
varies O
again O
, O
between O
city O
and O
country O
, O
between O
the O
various O
classes O
and O
professions O
, O
between O
the O
different O
provinces O
. O

In O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
is O
scarcely O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
any O
clear O
- O
cut O
policy B-TER
or O
attitude B-TER
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
responsible O
authorities O
will O
emerge O
. O

It O
seems O
evident O
that O
if O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
existed O
in O
a O
vacuum O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
despite O
their O
considerable O
number O
, O
would O
not O
present O
any O
problem O
which O
could O
not O
be O
solved O
with O
relatively O
humane O
and O
painless O
methods B-TER
. O

The O
country O
does O
not O
contain O
in O
itself O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
really O
serious O
and O
widespread O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
movement I-TER

One O
prominent O
member O
of O
the O
Zionist O
Revisionist O
inner O
circles O
imparted O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
bill B-TER
was O
aimed O
mainly O
as O
propaganda B-TER
to O
force O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
all O
categories O
in O
Poland B-LOC
to O
unite O
in O
support O
of O
the O
Government B-TER
search O
for O
a O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
, O
mainly O
in O
terms O
of O
emigration B-TER
. O

[ O
… O
] O
My O
own O
observation O
led O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
contributing O
to O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
proposal O
there O
are O
the O
following O
military O
and O
social O
aspects O
: O
military O
, O
in O
that O
the O
Army B-TER
’s I-TER
long O
- O
range O
program O
envisages O
the O
eventual O
centralization O
of O
meat O
control O
and O
refrigeration O
to O
meet O
emergency O
periods O
; O
and O
socially O
, O
in O
that O
the O
racial O
Polish B-LOC
peasant O
wants O
to O
replace O
the O
Jew B-TER
in O
the O
meat O
business B-TER
. O

As O
to O
the O
prospects O
of O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
amendment O
, O
this O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
will O
depend O
largely O
upon O
the O
Government B-TER
’s I-TER
attitude B-TER
in O
general O
towards O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
not O
look O
for O
the O
bill B-TER
to O
be O
rejected O
. O

[ O

The O
Department O
will O
note O
that O
the O
law B-TER

modified O
substantially O
. O

Primarily O
, O
the O
class O
of O
Jews B-TER
to O
be O
considered O
officially O
as O
Christians B-TER
was O
enlarged O
but O
its O
economic B-TER
restrictions I-TER
were O
increased O
, O
thus O
creating O
a O
sort O
of O
second O
- O
class O
citizenship O
. O

This O
represents O
the O
real O
compromise O
made O
between O
the O
two O
houses B-ORG
of I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
. O

Also O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
placing O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
a O
distinct B-TER
category I-TER
for O
political O
purposes O
was O
discarded O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
retain O
free O
active O
and O
passive O
suffrage O
, O
but O
the O
conditions O
of O
their O
enfranchisement B-TER
were O
made O
much O
more O
severe O
. O

Agricultural O
property O
may O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
their O
right O
to O
acquire O
real O
estate O
is O
limited O
, O
and O
the O
restriction O
of O
their O

is O
greatly O
increased O

Jewish B-TER
journalists I-TER
complain O
bitterly O
against O
the O
special O
press B-TER
restriction B-TER
by O
which O
the O
law B-TER
was O
amended O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Jewish B-TER
youth O
will O
suffer O
the O
most O
. O

A O
general O
removal B-TER
of O
male B-TER
Jews B-TER
aged O
17 O

70 O

ordered O
from O

is O

The O

the O

The O
Jewish B-TER

also O
required O
to O
register B-TER
on O
the O

day O
and O
fear O
that O
they O
too O
will O
be O
sent O
away O

Observers O
believe O
that O
this O

may O
be O
to O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
for O
reconstruction O
work O
there O
. O

Further O
details O
are O
being O
sought O

will O
be O
reported O

It O
would O
seem O
, O
from O
all O
indications O
, O
that O
the O
intent O
is O
to O
obtain O
a O
large O
group O
of O
workers B-TER
for O
use O
in O
Poland B-LOC

What O
this O
use O
is O
seems O
to O
be O
problematical O

but O
it O
may O
well O
be O
to O
prepare O
a O

the O
permanent O

of O
the O

. O

, O
of O
these O
men B-TER

It O
would O
seem O
that O
this O
movement O
may O
well O
be O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
movement O
of O
populations O
which O
the O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
are O
carrying O
out O
, O
including O
the O
bringing O
back O
of O
German B-TER

Russia B-LOC

and O
those O

There O
are O
many O
rumors B-TER

but O
to O
date O
unverified O
, O
that O
the O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
intend O
to O
bring O
into O
Bohemia B-TER

many O
of O
the O

If O
these O

, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
the O
plan O

I O
have O
the O

remain O
with O
the O
highest O
consideration O
Dear O
Chamberlain O
Zahle B-PER
The O
situation O
has O
worsened O
considerably O
, O
since O
21 O
September O
of O
the O
same O
year O
, O
when O
I O
last O
reported O
about O
the O
conditions O
here O
. O

By O
the O
messages O
I O
have O
received O
I O
am O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
State O
Protector O
and O
several O
of O
his O
officials O
sincerely O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
good O
relationship O
between O
Germans B-LOC
and O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
party B-ORG
with O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
German O
Secretary O
of O
State O
, O
Mr. O
Frank B-PER
at O
the O
helm O
have O
completely O
lacked O
the O
tact O
needed O
or O
they O
may O
have O
thought O
that O
with O
hardness O
one O
should O
suppress O
any O
resistance B-TER
from O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

Now O
you O
can O
see O
a O
Germanization B-ORG
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
in O
all O
areas O
. O

Many O
Czech O
estates O
, O
whose O
owners O
at O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
stayed O
abroad O
and O
did O
not O
return O
home O
, O
and O
estates O
which O
, O
at O
the O
demarcation O
, O
were O
located O
partly O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
and O
partly O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
, O
are O
placed O
under O
German B-TER
administration I-TER
. O

It O
is O
expected O
, O
that O
similar O
extensions O
will O
take O
place O
in O
regard O
to O
German B-LOC
Colonization O
. O

Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
are O
mostly O
being B-TER
handed I-TER
over I-TER
to O
Germans O
. O

In O
Banks B-TER
and O
Industrial O
Enterprises O
, O
there O
is O
strong O
pressure O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
side O
for O
mergers O
and O
transactions O
, O
so O
that O
the O
main O
influence O
of O
the O
company O
in O
question O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
rich O
German B-LOC
banks O
. O

Perhaps O
some O
of O
these O
transactions O
- O
as O
a O
bank O
director O
familiar O
with O
Czech O
transactions O
in O
the O
post O
- O
World O
Bank O
banking O
sector O
, O
has O
told O
me O
- O
are O
merely O
restitutions O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
proceed O
with O
greater O
severity O
and O
consistency O
than O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Your O
honour O
Mr O
Chamberlain O
Herluf B-PER
Zahle I-PER
Royal O
envoy O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
Everywhere O
the O
German O
language O
is O
being O
preferred O
over O
the O
Czech O
language O
. O

Learning B-TER
institutions I-TER
and O
theatres B-TER
are O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
and O
Germans O
are O
hired O
in O
all O
institutions O
and O
administration O
offices O
. O

For O
example O
, O
an O
order O
has O
been O
imposed O
on O
the O
Tram O
conductors O
to O
call O
out O
the O
stations O
, O
first O
in O
German O
and O
then O
secondly O
in O
Czech O
, O
has O
caused O
unnecessary O
commotion B-TER
of O
the O
public O
. O

In O
Bohemia B-LOC
and I-LOC
Moravia I-LOC
, O
there O
were O
no O
food B-TER
shortages O
and O
before O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
there O
were O
large O
supplies O
and O
industrial O
goods O
of O
great O
quality O
. O

In O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
, O
the O
stocks O
have O
been O
emptied O
and O
a O
rationing B-TER
system I-TER
has O
been O
introduced O
. O

The O
rationing O
is O
not O
yet O
as O
widespread O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
but O
it O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
this O
happens O
and O
then O
there O
will O
be O
a O
Gleichschaltung B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Dualism O
in O
the O
Administration O
contributes O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
demand O
for O
rationed O
consumer O
goods O
is O
hardly O
as O
well O
organized O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
. O

People O
often O
go O
to O
buy O
items O
, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
card O
system O
should O
be O
available O
just O
to O
find O
out O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O

After O
the O
Munich B-TER
Decree I-TER
last O
year O
, O
the O
diminished O
territory O
of O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
was O
established O
, O
and O
many O
Czechs B-LOC
believed B-TER
that O
with O
a O
little O
goodwill O
they O
could O
establish O
great O
relations O
with O
the O
German O
Empire O
. O

After O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
, O
a O
few O
people O
still O
hoped O
this O
was O
possible O
but O
now O
you O
wo O
n’t O
find O
a O
single O
Czech O
person O
that O
does O
n’t O
feel O
resentment O
against O
Germany O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
that O
these O
feelings O
will O
cause O
any O
outbreaks O
as O
long O
as O
the O
German O
discipline O
stands O
firm O
. O

The O
people O
are O
not O
armed O
and O
they O
know O
that O
the O
German B-ORG
troops I-ORG
and O
the O
German B-TER
police I-TER
will O
suppress B-TER
any O
demonstration O
with O
extreme O
brutality O
. O

In O
the O
first O
period O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
there O
where O
arrests B-TER
among O
the O
supporters O
of O
Beneš B-PER
' I-PER
, O
undesired O
politicians O
, O
legionaries O
, O
and O
others O
. O

However O
, O
many O
of O
the O
arrested O
have O
since O
been O
released B-TER
and O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
main O
clash O
with O
Germans O
and O
people O
not O
well O
regarded O
by O
them O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

When O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
activity O
increased O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
before O
- O
mentioned O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Military O
were O
now O
also O
arrested O
, O
as O
well O
as O
people O
from O
the O
industries O
, O
clerics O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Ever O
since O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
arrests O
wo O
n’t O
stop O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O
a O
system O
in O
the O
actions O
of O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
you O
might O
see O
this O
as O
taking O
hostages B-TER
. O

A O
former O
Czech O
politician B-TER
and O
diplomat B-TER
, O
which O
has O
been O
retired O
for O
several O
years O
, O
told O
me O
about O
some O
of O
the O
arrests O
. O

He O
told O
about O
how O
certain O
people O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
list O
of O
arrests O
had O
remained O
in O
Freedom O
– O
at O
least O
until O
now O
– O
just O
because O
they O
were O
not O
at O
home O
when O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
came O
for O
them O
, O
so O
the O
police O
went O
on O
to O
the O
next O
one O
on O
the O
list O
. O

My O
informant O
told O
me O
that O
he O
changed O
his O
residence O
because O
he O
was O
afraid O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
arrested O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
arrested O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration B-LOC
camp I-LOC
Buchenwald I-LOC
in O
Germany B-LOC

A O
reliable O
source O
told O
me O
that O
the O
internees O
are O
treated O
just O
as O
it O
is O
described O
in O
the O
newly O
published O
English O
white B-TER
paper I-TER
about O
German O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER

The O
prominent O
Jews B-TER
, O
the O
ones O
who O
lived O
there O
before O
the O
World O
War O
, O
are O
not O
as O
affected O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
persecutions I-TER
as O
others O
. O

I O
know O
of O
several O
examples O
of O
Jewish B-TER
Bank I-TER
Directors O
, O
although O
retired O
, O
that O
are O
working O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
daily O
in O
the O
Bank O
to O
explain O
the O
conditions O
to O
the O
new O

live O
peacefully O
in O
their O

However O
, O
they O
had O
to O
turn O
in O
their O
cars O
and O
radios O
. O

I O
have O
also O
heard O
of O
Jewish B-TER
lawyers I-TER
that O
work O
from O
home O
and O
then O
have O
their O
Aryan O
colleagues O
take O
the O
cases O
to O
court O
. O

Some O
Jewish B-TER
doctors I-TER
have O
been O
given O
temporary O
work O
in O
hospitals O
. O

Jews B-TER
who O
ca O
n’t O
prove O
a O
permanent O
residence O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
seem O
to O
be O
facing O
very O
bad O
times O
. O

They O
will O
probably O
all O
be O
transferred B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC

to O
the O
regions O
around O
Lemberg B-LOC

From O
Mährisch B-LOC

a O

for O
the O

Poland O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
then O
canceled O
their O
plans O

and O
the O
Czech O
national O
unity O
party O
ordered O
its O
members O
to O
stay O
indoors O
and O
keep O

The O
Germans O
also O
distanced O
themselves O
from O
holding O
the O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Labour B-TER
Day I-TER

the O
traffic O
in O
the O
main O

was O
very O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
prohibition B-TER
, O
many O
Czech O
people O
wore O
cockades O
with O
silk O
ribbons O
in O
the O
Czechoslovakia O
colours O

and O
many O
male O
persons O
covered O
their O
heads O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
cap O
of O
as O
the O
late O
President O
Masaryk B-PER
usually O
wore O

All O
the O
Czech B-ORG

stationed O
in O
the O
Main O

the O
German B-ORG
Police I-ORG

S.S. B-ORG

had O
taken O
up O
positions O
as O
a O
reserve O
in O

The O
tensions O
erupted O
into O

as O
large O
sections O
the O
S.A. B-ORG

passed O
through O
the O
main O

with O

and O
various O
clashes O
between O
the O
Czech O
people O

took O
place O

In O
some O
streets O

the O

and O
German O

had O
to O
support O
the O

During O
the O

a O

A O

However O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
population O

agitated O
state O

the O

must O
be O
considered O
less O

was O

However O
, O
we O

not O
exclude O
that O
the O
incidents O
will O
give O
rise O
to O
new O
reprisals B-TER

the O

P.S. O
This O

with O
a O
Swedish B-LOC

to O
the O
Swedish O
Embassy O

Berlin B-LOC
for O
its O
Further O

The O
Jewish B-ORG
authorities I-ORG
in O
Berlin B-LOC
who O
are O
competent O
only O
for O
Reich B-TER
territory O
have O
little O
precise O
information B-TER
concerning O
conditions B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
although O
the O
following O
is O
their O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
that O
area O
based O
upon O
such O
meager O
reliable O
date O
as O
they O
have O
been O
able O
to O
obtain O
: O
A O
mass O
transfer B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
the O
Kattowitz B-LOC
region O
which O
was O
threatened O
has O
been O
postponed O
at O
least O
until O
March O
. O

It O
is O
not O
known O
here O
to O
what O
extent O
the O
transfer B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
from O
other O
regions O
is O
still O
being O
carried O
out O
under O
present O
conditions O
although O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
considerable O
numbers O
of O
Jews B-TER
are O
being O
expelled O
from O
Lodz B-LOC
and O
are O
being O
sent O
east O
. O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
appears O
to O
be O
at O
its O
worst O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Lublin B-LOC
where O
it O
is O
said O
that O
they O
are O
being O
subjected O
to O
particularly O
brutal O
treatment B-TER
by O
the O
party B-TER
SS B-TER
Guards O
. O

It O
is O
also O
stated O
that O
Jews B-TER
have O
been O
sent O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
in O
unheated O
trains B-TER
with O
the O
result O
that O
cases O
of O
freezing O
to O
death O
have O
been O
reported O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
While O
reports O
which O
are O
mostly O
second O
hand O
are O
received O
in O
sufficient O
quantity O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
unquestionably O
great O
suffering O
is O
being O
endured O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
and O
by O
large O
groups O
of O
Poles B-TER
it O
is O
pointed O
out O
in O
local O
German B-TER
circles O
that O
the O
current O
hardships O
, O
which O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
are O
inevitable O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
military O
campaign O
and O
of O
the O
redistribution O
of O

pale O
by O
comparison O
with O
those O
which O
existed O
in O
Poland B-LOC
following O
the O
last O

and O
that O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
some O
of O
the O
stern O
measures O
now O
being O
taken O
by O
the O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
are O
necessary O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
eliminating O
the O
criminal B-TER
elements I-TER
released O
from O
Polish B-TER
jails B-TER
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
war O
and O
for O
the O
restoration O
of O
order O
following O
the O
complete O
collapse O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
state O
system O
. O

It O
is O
learned O
that O
the O
some O
1200 O
Jews B-TER
removed B-TER
from O
Stettlin B-LOC
have O
been O
settled B-TER
in O
three O
small O
towns O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
Lublin B-LOC
where O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
now O
living O
under O
conditions B-TER
of O
considerable O
hardship O
and O
poverty B-TER
. O

According O
to O
reliable O
information B-TER
the O
order B-TER
for O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
from O
Schneidemuhl B-LOC
was O
issued O
by O
the O
same O
local O
authority O
who O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
action O
taken O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
. O

An O
arrangement B-TER
has O
been O
tentatively O
concluded O
whereby O
the O
Schneidemuhl B-LOC
Jews B-TER
will O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
Eastern O
Poland B-LOC
as O
has O
been O
the O
case O
with O
those O
from O
Stettin B-LOC
but O
will O
be O
transferred B-TER

other O

Information O

for O
your O
reference O

Due O
to O
the O
outbreak O
of O
second O
great O
war O
in O
Europe O
the O
persecution B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC
has O
become O
intensified O
recently O

At O
last O
the O
Jews B-TER
feel O
their O
living B-TER
to O
be O
under O
threat B-TER
and O
have O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
seek O
refuge B-TER

Main O
testimonies B-TER
are O
as O
follows O
( O
told O
by O
a O
German B-TER
named O
Peistein O
bound O
for O
Tokyo B-LOC

At O
the O
personal O
level O
, O
the O
persecution B-TER
is O
even O
more O
severe O
. O

Association O
with O
Germans B-TER
is O
strictly O
forbidden O
, O
and O
even O
kids B-TER
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
play O
with O

Although O
in O
legal O
terms O
we O
are O
not O
expelled O
from O
the O
country O
, O
the O
method O
used O
goes O
against O
humanity O

arouses O
( O
uncontrollable O
) O
anger O

( O
told O
by O
a O
Jewish B-TER
merchant O
named O
Frinkle B-PER
bound O
for O

Given O
the O
situation O

there O
is O
a O
need O
to O
closely O
monitor O
the O

of O

Jews B-TER
are O
being O
seriously O
persecuted B-TER
by O
the O
Nazi B-TER
regime I-TER

It O
is O
not O
an O
exaggeration O
to O
say O
that O
those O
fellow O
[ O
Jews B-TER
] O
living O
in O
Germany B-LOC
are O
suffering O
from O
tremendous O
hardship O

This O
time O
when O

were I-TER
confiscated I-TER
and O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
bring O

. O

The O
Government B-TER
appears O
to O
be O
making O
every O
effort O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
to O
appease O
the O
Jews B-TER
by O
restraining O
molestation B-TER
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
while O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
proceeding O

such O
discriminatory O

mentioned O
Law B-TER
for I-TER
the I-TER
Organization I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
College I-TER

stipulates O
that O

citizens O
enjoying O
full O
civil B-TER
rights I-TER
can O
be O
members O

therefore O
excluding B-TER
Jews B-TER
. O

Some O
are O
suspected O
of O
clandestinely O
encouraging O
attacks B-TER
on O
the O
Jews B-TER
because O
of O
their O
conviction B-TER
that O
( O
a O
) O
this O
is O
the O
solution O
of O
the O
entire O
Rumanian B-LOC
problem O
and O
( O
b O
) O
it O
will O
curry O
favor O
with O
Germany B-TER
. O

Rumanians B-TER
in O
general O
seem O
to O
wish O
to O
wreak O
their O
wrath O
either O
actively O
or O
passively O
on O
the O
Jews B-TER
for O
the O
events O
which O
have O
taken O
place O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
, O
particularly O
the O
many O
instances O
which O
are O
gradually O
becoming O
known O
in O
which O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
either O
aided O
or O
encouraged O
by O
communists B-TER
and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
local O
populations O
, O
rose O
against O
the O
departing O
Rumanian B-LOC
officials O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
entry O

Continual O
reports B-TER
of O
persecutions B-TER
and O
killings B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
the O
provinces O

particularly O
in O
Moldavian B-LOC
villages O

the O

drifting O
into O
Bucharest B-LOC
daily O
, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
ascertain O
just O
what O
proportion O
of O
them O
may O
be O
true O
. O

I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
Ambassador B-TER
Stoica B-PER
, O
formerly O
Ambassador B-TER
at O
Ankara B-LOC
and O
now O
Under O
Secretary B-TER
of I-TER
Propaganda I-TER
, O
told O
me O
the O
other O
evening O
at O
dinner O
at O
my O
house O
in O
honor O
of O
himself O
and O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
newspapers B-TER
, O
that O
his O
Government B-ORG
was O
going O
to O
do O
everything O
within O
its O
power O
to O
prevent O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
outbreaks I-TER
, O
but O
that O
it O
greatly O
feared O
such O
outbreaks B-TER
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Army B-TER
as O
the O
latter O
was O
so O
incensed O
at O
the O
treatment O
meted O
out O
to O
it O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
when O
it O
was O
withdrawing O
. O

I O
observed O
that O
for O
once O
Rumania B-LOC
had O
a O
good O
press B-TER
in O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
where O
there O
was O
great O
sympathy O
because O
it O
had O
been O
set O
upon O
by O
a O
powerful O
nation O
of O
180,000,000 O
people O
, O
and O
that O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
sacrifice O
this O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
Pogrom B-TER
or O
two O
. O

On O
another O
recent O
occasion O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
informally O
to O
emphasize O
to O
Prime B-TER
Minister I-TER
Gigurtu B-PER
that O
any O
internal O
disturbance O
, O
especially O
Jewish B-TER
persecution I-TER
, O
might O
easily O
be O
seized O
upon O
by O
Russia B-LOC
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
further O
action O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Gigurtu B-PER
group O
maintains O
that O
to O
pass O
rigid O
laws B-TER
against I-TER
Jews I-TER
at O
the O
present O
critical O
moment O
would O
seriously O
affect O
the O
economic B-TER
structure I-TER
of O
the O
State O
, O
as O
well O
as O
create O
a O
most O
unfortunate O
impression B-TER
among O
nations O
abroad O
, O
particularly O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Some O
observers O
take O
the O
view O
that O
should O
there O
be O
no O
further O
pressure O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Bulgaria B-LOC
for O
territorial O
cession O
at O
present O
the O
moderate O
group O
will O
win O
its O
point O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
strong O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
reaction I-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
; O
if O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Government O
is O
forced O
to O
cede O
more O
territory O
immediately O
, O
a O
cession O
for O
which O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
prepared O
, O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
thesis O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
win O
because O
the O
Government O
will O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
resort O
to O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
agitation I-TER
as O
a O
cloak O
and O
counter O
- O
irritant O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
a O
few O
mild O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measures I-TER
have O
been O
announced O
but O
nothing O
to O
suggest O
a O
really O
vicious O
program O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
I O
accordingly O
feel O
that O
no O
really O
strong O
Jewish B-TER
persecutions I-TER
are O
apt O
to O
eventuate O
in O
the O
near O
future O
except O
as O
they O
may O
arise O
out O
of O
new O
circumstances O
created O
by O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
events O
or O
further O
dissatisfaction O
in O
the O
Army B-TER
. O

The O
following O
information O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
from O
Krakow B-LOC
was O
furnished O
in O
confidence O
by O
Jewish B-TER
leaders I-TER
at O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
of O
Krakow B-LOC
now O
totals O
some O
67,000 O
including O
about O
11,000 O
deportees B-TER
who O
have O
recently O
arrived O
from O
Polish B-LOC
regions O
annexed O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
deportation B-TER
held O
in O
May O
will O
immediately O
affect O
a O
total O
of O
80,000 O
Jews B-TER
and O
it O
can O
not O
be O
regarded O
otherwise O
than O
a O
major O
disaster O
to O
Polish B-TER
Jewry B-TER
. O

The O
break O
up O
of O
the O
ancient O
, O
rich O
and O
powerful O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
at O
Krakow B-LOC
can O
bring O
nothing O
but O
destitution B-TER
to O
its O
members O
who O
will O
be O
forced O
on O
short O
notice O
to O
emigrate B-TER
without O
resources O
to O
such O
localities O
in O
the O
General O
Government O
as O
are O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
receive O
them O
. O

The O
compulsory B-TER
labor I-TER
law B-TER
envisaged O
the O
employment O
of O
conscripts O
not O
liable O
to O
or O
desired O
for O
military B-TER
service I-TER
on O
work O
supplementary O
to O
the O
military B-TER
effort O
. O

The O
virtually O
general O
mobilization O
has O
resulted O
in O
a O
large O
reservoir O
of O
such O
labor B-TER
which O
is O
composed O
entirely O
or O
in O
large O
measure O
of O
Jews B-TER
since O
their O
number O
permitted O
in O
military B-TER
units I-TER
is O
restricted B-TER
to O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
complements O
, O
and O
includes O
persons O
high O
in O
commercial B-TER
, O
industrial B-TER
and O
professional B-TER
life O
who O
previously O
had O
performed O
no O
manual O
labor B-TER
as O
well O
as O
former O
army B-TER
officers I-TER
of O
Jewish B-TER
extraction O
, O
many O
of O
high O
rank O

They O
are O
organized O
in O
labor B-TER
camps I-TER
under O
strict O
military B-TER

, O
receive O
no O
pay O
or O

in O
a O
condition O
bordering O
on O

Most O
of O
the O
labor O
presently O
performed O
by O
them O
appears O
to O
have O
no O

it O
is O
generally O
considered O
that O
the O
persecution B-TER

increase O
either O
at O

The O
establishment O

A O
strange O
commentary O
on O
life O
in O
German B-TER
- I-TER
occupied I-TER
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
presented O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
a O
nationalist B-TER
Pole B-TER
has O
endeavored O
to O
take O
on O
the O
‘ O
protective O
coloration O
’ O
of O
the O
Jew B-TER
in O
order O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
German B-ORG
police I-ORG
or O
to O
avoid O
compulsory B-TER
labor I-TER
. O

These O
‘ O
refugees B-TER
’ O
have O
adopted O
Jewish B-TER
insignia B-TER
and O
taken O
up O
residence O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
; O
many O
stories O
are O
current O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
of O
Jews B-TER
tearing O
off O
their O
racial B-TER
badges I-TER
and O
passing O
them O
over O
in O
the O
streets O
to O
fleeing O
Poles B-TER
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
during O
the O
period O
of O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
disturbances O
in O
Poland B-LOC
prior O
to O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
the O
600,000 O
people O
in O
the O
Jewish O
district O
, O
almost O
evenly O
divided O
between O
Poles B-TER
and O
Jews B-TER
, O
managed O
to O
get O
along O
together O
peacefully O
and O
lived O
in O
a O
community O
spirit O
which O
was O
not O
noticeable O
in O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
pending O
segregation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
an O
official O
ghetto B-TER
affects O
an O
equal O
number O
of O
Poles B-TER
and O
the O
move O
may O
in O
the O
long O

bring O
greater O
discomfort O
to O
the O
latter O
than O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER

At O
any O
rate O
the O
Jews B-TER
may O
well O
be O
in O
a O
better O
position O
to O
maintain O
a O
united O

to O

In O
view O
of O
the O
heavy O
migration B-TER
of O

into O
the O
new O
Jewish B-TER
ghetto B-TER
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
the O
period O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
voluntary O
establishment O
there O
by O

families B-TER
from O

quarters O
of O
the O

been O
extended O
through O
November O

At O
the O

time O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
have O
been O
enlarged O
to O
take O
in O
certain O
additional O
blocks O
and O
it O
is O
feared O
that O
this O
enlargement O
may O
mean O
the O
moving B-TER

of O

not O
as O

the O

There O
are O
taking O

to O
whether O

in O

express O
the O
hope O
that O
this O

The O
above O
developments O
indicate O
that O
German B-TER
anti B-TER

Semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
are O
rapidly O
being O
put O
into O
effect O
in O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER

At O
the O

time O
the O
German B-TER

publishes O
articles O

somewhat O
similar O
measures B-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC

Jugoslavia B-LOC

Bulgaria B-LOC
and O
unoccupied B-TER
France I-TER

There O
appears O
, O
consequently O
, O
to O
be O
a O
definite O
program O
of O
carrying O
German B-TER
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitism I-TER
beyond O

into O
such O
countries O
as O

into O
the O
German B-TER
sphere I-TER
of I-TER

But O
, O
as O
earlier O
despatches O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
has O
definitely O
worsened O
since O
the O
inauguration O
of O
the O
present B-ORG
regime I-ORG
three O
months O
ago O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the O
green O
- O
shirted O
Iron O

is O
in O
power O
, O
and O
the O
Iron O
Guard O
is O
notoriously O
and O
avowedly O
an O
essentially O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
organization I-TER
. O

In O
the O
second O
place O
, O
Rumania B-LOC
not O
only O
has O
come O
under O
the O
direct O
‘ O

’ O
of O

is O
now O
actually O
a O

, O
thirdly O

the O

requires O
scape O

all O
the O

of O

finds O
that O

old O

serve O
admirably O

this O
unhappy O

These O
considerations O
, O
plus O
an O
underlying O
sentiment O
of O
genuine O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitism I-TER
generally O
, O
provide O
sufficient O
reason O
and O
background O
for O
Jewish B-TER
fears B-TER
and O
sufferings O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
today O
. O

[ O

In O
recent O
weeks O
the O
Jewish B-TER
plaint O
has O
not O
been O
one O
of O
lost O
positions O
, O
special O
taxes B-TER
or O
discriminatory B-TER
restrictions I-TER
– O
that O
is O
an O
old O
story O

Rather O
it O
has O
been O
one O
of O
deaths B-TER

torture B-TER

beatings O
, O
abductions B-TER
, O
confiscation B-TER
, O
robbery B-TER
and O
violence B-TER
in O
all O
forms O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
exaggeration O
to O
say O
that O
here O
today O
one O
sees O
the O
Jews B-TER
with O
tears O
, O
hollow O
eyes O
and O
wringing O
hands O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
never O
go O
out O
; O
they O
keep O
to O
their O
homes O
for O
fear B-TER
of O
meeting O
violence B-TER
in O
the O
street O

A O
few O

who O
have O
reasons O
to O
fear B-TER

may O
be O
sought O
out O

creep O
from O

Those O
of O
means O

frantically O
to O
dispose O
of O
their O
property B-TER

The O
text O

anti B-TER

Law B-TER

Nation I-TER

passed O
in O

With O
only O
49000 O

holding O
no O

government B-TER
positions O
there O
was O
no O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
. O

The O
law B-TER
is O
said O
to O
be O
drastic O
in O
its O
terms O
but O
a O
loophole O
in O
its O
strict O
enforcement O
may O
be O
the O
fact O
that O

2 O
Mr. O
Foreign B-PER
minister I-PER
, O
Through O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
National B-TER
Radio I-TER
Broadcasts I-TER
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
, O
in O
mid O
- O
January O
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
, O
had O
been O
on O
a O
1 O
- O
day O
visit O
with O
Chancellor O
Hitler B-PER
. O

In O
Bucharest B-LOC
was O
the O
meeting O
not O
officially O
mentioned O
, O
and O
therefore O
gave O
rise O
to O
some O
remarkable O
rumours O
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
General O
’s O
return O
, O
a O
German B-ORG
General I-ORG
Staff I-ORG
Officer I-ORG
, O
Major B-PER
Döring I-PER
, O
was O
murdered O
on O
the O
street O
in O
Bucharest O
. O

The O
killer O
is O
said O
to O
be O
a O
man O
with O
a O
Greek B-LOC
name O
, O
Dimitrie B-PER
Sarandos I-PER
, O
who O
had O
come O
from O
America B-LOC
with O
a O
Turkish B-LOC
passport O
and O
whose O
profession O
is O
stated O
as O
being O
a O
wrestler O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
the O
murder B-TER
has O
so O
far O
not O
been O
resolved O
; O
officials O
say O
that O
they O
are O
still O
investigating O
the O
crime O
. O

However O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
’s I-PER
dismissal O
of O
the O
legionary B-ORG
Minister B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
General B-PER
Petrovicescu I-PER
, O
who O
was O
accused O
of O
not O
taking O
immediate O
action O
for O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
. O

The O
Legionary O
Press B-TER
protested O
against O
this O
dismissal O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
emphasizing O
its O
strong O
association O
with O
the O
Axis B-TER
Powers I-TER
, O
calling O
for O
revenge O
on O
those O
who O
stood O
behind O
the O
killer O
. O

It O
can O
thus O
be O
concluded O
, O
that O
the O
murder O
was O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
presence B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Axis I-TER
in O
Romania B-LOC
, O
as O
Romanian O
Patriots O
suggested O
it O
in O
a O
British B-LOC
Radio O
broadcasts O
, O
since O
the O
warring O
parties O
agree O
that O
only O
the O
Axis O
military O
precautions O
in O
Romania O
save O
them O
from O
further O
segregation O
between O
their O
hostile O
neighbours O
. O

One O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
Press O
controlled O
by O
the O
Legionnaires O
made O
propaganda B-TER
for O
the O
Revolution O
, O
i.e. O
further O
looting O
of O
the O
possessive O
classes O
and O
especially O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
and O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Freemasons B-TER
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
that O
he O
ruled O
with O
some O
Ministers O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
i.e. O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
evolutionary O
development O
, O
while O
the O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
Legionary B-ORG
Commander O
Horia B-PER
Sima I-PER
with O
other O
Ministers O
, O
ruled O
towards O
a O
Revolution O
and O
immediate O
looting O
and O
destruction O
of O
everything O
of O
endurance O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
unsustainable O
and O
as O
a O
first O
serious O
countermeasure O
from O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
’s O
site O
emerged O
on O
21 O
of O
this O
month O
a O
decree O
abolishing O
the O
main O
efforts O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
to O
militarize O
the O
Romanian O
institutions O
as O
well O
as O
important O
State O
enterprises O
. O

I O
have O
reported O
this O
in O
my O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

The O
answer O
to O
this O
relatively O
peaceful O
act O
was O
that O
the O
Legionary O
Party O
on O
the O
22 O
of O
this O
month O
occupied O
a O
police O
barrack O
with O
600 O
men O
, O
located O
right O
next O
to O
the O
Foreign B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
, O
where O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
has O
his O
Bureau O
as O
well O
as O
his O
temporary O
residence O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
rebellion B-TER
had O
begun O
. O

It O
soon O
became O
clear O
that O
the O
Legionnaires O
were O
well O
supplied O
with O
rifles B-TER
and I-TER
ammunition I-TER
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
prepared O
the O
action O
by O
pre B-TER
- I-TER
occupying I-TER
houses O
taken O
from O
wealthy B-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
all O
districts O
. O

The O
garrison O
commanded O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
, O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
capturing O
the O
Police O
barrack O
, O
from O
which O
the O
Legionnaires O
attacked O
the O
Foreign O
Ministry O
with O
the O
purpose O
of O
killing O
the O
General O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
, O
the O
military O
sought O
to O
avoid O
shooting O
and O
trusted O
the O
effect O
of O
their O
sole O
appearance O
. O

However O
, O
as O
Soldier B-TER
everywhere O
where O
shot O
down O
, O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
second O
day O
, O
a O
common O
battle O
erupted O
throughout O
the O
city O
, O
during O
which O
the O
military O
, O
with O
guns O
, O
tanks O
and O
machine O
guns O
, O
damaged O
the O
fortified O
houses O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

There O
were O
many O
dead O
and O
wounded O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
know O
how O
many O
. O

However O
, O
the O
number O
of O
victims O
is O
hardly O
proportional O
to O
the O
periodic O
violent O
cannonade O
that O
lasted O
all O
day O
and O
night O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
days O
. O

All O
this O
time O
, O
Legionnaire O
gangs O
carried O
out O
gruesome O

where O
large O

In O

, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O

fiercely O
proclaimed O
Legionary B-ORG
Movement I-ORG
people O
, O
i.e. O
The O
dregs O

they O
really O
were O

without O

- O
called O
leadership O
being O
able O
to O
limit O
the O
struggle O
to O
its O
true O
purpose O
, O
which O
was O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
pure O
Legionary O
government O
under O
Horia B-PER
Sima I-PER
. O

Following O
the O
culmination O
of O
the O
Romanian O
Military O
’s O
efforts O
early O
on O
Thursday O
( O
the O
23rd O
) O
, O
Horia B-PER
Sima I-PER
sent O
out O
, O
via O
Radio O
and O
leaflets O
, O
an O
order B-TER
to O
the O
Legionnaires O
to O
put O
down O
the O
weapons O
. O

The O
fighters O
only O
partially O
complied O
with O
the O
order O
, O
but O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
afternoon O
, O
at O
least O
, O
they O
succeeded O
in O
establishing O
peace O
while O
motorized O
divisions O
of O
the O
present O
German B-ORG
Armed I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
demonstratively O
drove O
through O
the O
city O
obviously O
prepared O
to O
assist O
the O
Romanian O
military O
if O
necessary O
. O

By O
Friday O
morning O
, O
the O
uprising O
was O
dissolved B-TER
and O
the O
entire O
city O
occupied O
by O
the O
Romanian O
Military O
, O
which O
began O
searching O
for O
the O
Legionnaires O
’ O
hidden O
abode O
and O
large O
quantities O
of O
stolen O
goods O
distributed O
over O
many O
houses O
have O
since O
been O
brought O
to O
light O
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
the O
entire O
Rebellion O
has O
been O
planned O
and O
staged O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
’s I-PER
closest O
Employees O
in O
the O
Legionary O
State O
’s O
leadership O
. O

The O
police B-ORG
were O
searching O
for O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
Horia B-PER
Sima I-PER
and O
it O
is O
said O
that O
he O
has O
been O
arrested O
today O
. O

The O
appointment O
of O
a O
general O
government O
was O
generally O
expected O
, O
but O
so O
far O
, O
nothing O
has O
been O
published O
regarding O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
government O
, O
let O
alone O
its O
dismissal O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
the O
country O
is O
currently O
administered O
solely O
the O
Governor O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
, O
currently O
administers O
the O
country O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
declared O
state O
of O
emergency O
. O

Intelligence B-TER
from O
the O
Province O
suggests O
that O
rebellions O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
as O
here O
have O
been O
common O
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
while O
the O
rural O
population O
itself O
has O
turned O
against O
the O
plans O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

After O
the O
rebellion O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PER
issued O
a O
comprehensive O
Proclamation O
to O
the O
People O
. O

The O
general B-PER
thanked O
the O
Army O
for O
its O
courage O
, O
describing O
the O
suffering O
he O
went O
through O
before O
it O
became O
inevitable O
to O
shoot O
at O
the O
people O
, O
he O
declares O
that O
from O
now O
on O
he O
will O
personally O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
youth O
’s O
education O
and O
that O
all O
who O
are O
guilty O
will O
be O
punished B-TER
. O

General O
Disarmament O
will O
now O
be O
implemented O
by O
the O
Military O
. O

The O
Romanians O
here O
have O
stated O
to O
me O
that O
the O
proclamation O
is O
well O
suited O
to O
make O
an O
impression O
, O
especially O
within O
the O
large O
Romanian O
peasant O
population O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
is O
found O
to O
be O
too O
lyrical O
and O
weak O
to O
deter O
future O
troublemakers O
. O

Especially O
regarding O
the O
last O
point O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
the O
general B-PER
now O
faces O
a O
number O
of O
challenges O
in O
setting O
up O
a O
new O
Ministry O
, O
but O
the O
situation O
is O
still O
too O
unclear O
to O
be O
overlooked O
. O

H.m O

King B-PER
Mihai I-PER

the O
Royal O
family O
have O
before O

during O

period O
stayed O
in O

The O

estimate O
of O
two O

the O

the O
most O

blamed O
primarily O
the O
savage O

in O
the O
Jewish B-TER

have O
been O
applied O
for O
. O

The O
slaughter O
house O
certainly O
did O
figure O
in O
as O
much O
as O
I O
have O
it O
indirectly O
from O
an O
engineer O
working O
there O
that O
when O
he O
reported O
for O
work O
the O
next O

he O
found O
sixty O
Jewish B-TER
corpses B-TER
on O
the O
hooks O
used O
for O
carcasses O

all O
skinned O

quantity O
of O

about O
would O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
they O
had O
been O
skinned B-TER
alive I-TER

The O
above O
estimate O
takes O
no O

the O
much O

The O
popular O
Rumanian B-TER
reaction O
to O
the O
recent O
excesses B-TER
committed I-TER
against I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
is O
difficult O
of O
assessment O
. O

The O
Rumanians B-TER
have O
heretofore O
insisted O
upon O
being O
known O
as O
a O
tolerant O
people B-TER
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
learn O
of O
the O
massacres B-TER
and O
other O
atrocities B-TER
with O
, O
possibly O
, O
a O
slight O
feeling O
of O
satisfaction O
, O
mixed O
with O
a O
stronger O
sense O
of O
surprise O
, O
shock O
and O
misgiving O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
true O
that O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
campaign I-TER
of O
the O
Legionary B-ORG
régime I-ORG
, O
the O
continual O
attacks B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
press I-TER
, O
the O
present O
military B-TER
collaboration B-TER
with O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
Germany B-TER
, O
and O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
Government B-TER
during O
General B-PER
Antonescu I-PER
’s I-PER
absence O
at O
the O
front O

during O
which O
time O
Mr. B-PER
Mihai I-PER
Antonescu I-PER
has O
been O
Acting O

have O
all O
had O
their O
effect O
on O
popular B-TER
opinion I-TER
, O
tending O
to O
make O
it O
especially O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
, O
but O
I O
fail O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
country O
as O
a O
whole O
willingly O
countenances O
outright O
slaughter B-TER
and I-TER
brutality I-TER
in O
the O
handling O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
But O
the O
fact O
remains O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
popular O
uprising B-TER
or O
movement O
against O
all O
these O
cruelties B-TER
. O

It O
may O
well O
be O
that O
the O
ethical O
sense O
of O
the O
Rumanian B-TER
people B-TER
has O
been O
somewhat O
dulled O
by O
recent O
miseries O
and O
disasters O
[ O
... O
] O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
they O
are O
not O
fully O
conscious O
of O
the O
horrors B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jewish I-TER
phase I-TER
. O

Whatever O
the O
cause O
, O
1941 O
has O
thus O
far O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
black O
year O
for O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
. O

My O
own O
experience O
is O
that O
the O
better O
class O
of O
Rumanians B-TER
thoroughly O
disapproves O
of O
the O
methods B-TER
resorted I-TER
to I-TER
from I-TER
time I-TER
to I-TER
time I-TER
against I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
the O
cruelty B-TER
and O
the O
injustice O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
fact O
remains O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
lower B-TER
- I-TER
class I-TER
Jew I-TER
who O
has O
filtered O
into O
Rumania B-LOC

the O

village O
and O
small O

town O
life O
is O
, O
by O
and O
large O
, O
not O
assimilable O
. O

The O
Rumanian B-TER
resents O
his O
presence O
, O
although O
it O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
his O
own O
laissez O
faire O
that O
this O
type O
of O
Jew B-TER
is O
here O
, O
and O
, O
from O

time O
when O
things O

The O

further O

Casto B-PER
Caruso I-PER
The O
Department B-ORG
is O
already O
aware O
that O
the O
military B-TER
occupation I-TER
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bucovina B-LOC
was O
followed O
by O
the O
establishment B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
in I-TER
ghettos I-TER
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
and O
that O
large O
numbers O
, O
particularly O
from O
Bessarabia B-LOC
, O
were O
gradually O
evacuated B-TER
into O
the O
territory O
lying O
beyond O
the O
Dniester B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

These O
measures B-TER
were O
carried O
out O
under O
appalling O
conditions O
and O
accompanied O
by O
innumerable O
kinds O
of O
frightfulness O
, O
including O
robbery B-TER
, O
starvation B-TER
, O
killings B-TER
and O
other O
brutalities O
. O

Only O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
Jews B-TER
are O
believed O
now O
to O
be O
left O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
– O
estimates O
vary O
from O
ten O
to O
thirty O
thousand O
out O
of O
a O
total O
of O
just O
over O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
residing O
there O
prior O
to O
the O
Russian B-TER
seizure I-TER
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
in O
June O
1940 O
– O
while O
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
there O
are O
, O
according O
to O
reliable O
Jews B-TER
, O
some O
fifteen O
to O
twenty O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
now O
awaiting O
deportation B-TER
eastward O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

A O
great O
many O
, O
undoubtedly O
tens O
of O
thousands O
, O
have O
already O
been O
thus O
evacuated B-TER
. O

During O
the O
past O
three O
weeks O
evidence O
has O
been O
accumulating O
– O
first O
in O
the O
form O
of O
vague O
rumors B-TER
and O
unconfirmed O
reports O
, O
then O
through O
increasingly O
substantial O
sources O
of O
information O
and O
finally O
in O
exchange O
of O
letters B-TER
between O
Marshal O
Antonescu B-PER
and O
the O
head B-TER
of O
the O
local O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
– O
that O
such O
as O
remains O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
and O
Bessarabia B-LOC
is O
being O
evacuated B-TER
eastward O
into O
the O
war O
- O
devastated O
territory O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
under O
conditions O
so O
appalling O
that O
they O
would O
seem O
to O
afford O
a O
substantial O
share O
of O
the O
evacuees B-TER
little O
chance O
to O
survive B-TER
. O

Persistent O
reports O
have O
reached O
me O
daily O
regarding O
these O
unfortunate O
people B-TER
– O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
, O
including O
the O
old O
and O
ill O
– O
who O
, O
given O
only O
a O
few O
hours O
notice O
with O
the O
right O
to O
take O
with O
them O
only O
a O
meager O
ten O
kilograms O
of O
belongings B-TER
and O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O
dollars O
in O
money O
– O
the O
stories B-TER
almost O
invariably O
add O
that O
these O
belongings B-TER
and O
the O
money O
are O
taken O
from O
them O
en O
route O
– O
have O
been O
herded O
eastward O
on O
foot O
or O
in O
carts O
or O
box O
- O
cars O
, O
to O
war O
- O
swept O
regions O
where O
buildings O
have O
been O
razed O
and O
food B-TER
and O
other O
supplies B-TER
destroyed O
or O
removed O
and O
where O
winter O
weather O
will O
soon O
prevail O
. O

This O
modern O
Captivity B-TER
would O
seem O
deliberately O
calculated O
to O
serve O
a O
program O
of O
virtual O
extermination B-TER
and O
, O
even O
if O
the O
persistent O
rumors B-TER
that O
the O
evacuees B-TER
in O
numberless O
cases O
are O
plundered B-TER
of O
their O
belongings B-TER
, O
that O
dozens O
and O
hundreds O
are O
shot B-TER
en O
route O
, O
pushed O
off O
bridges O
or O
dead O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
are O
greatly O
exaggerated O
or O
untrue O
, O
it O
seems O
certain O
that O
many O
thousands O
will O
perish O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
the O
last O
paragraph O
of O
my O
telegram O
first O
cited O
above O
, O
many O
of O
these O
reports O
and O
rumors B-TER
are O
unconfirmed O
and O
must O
be O
classified O
as O
hearsay O
, O
or O
even O
propaganda B-TER
by O
interested O
persons O
[ O
... O
] O
but O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
say O
that O
even O
the O
minimum O
of O
truth O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
lies O
in O
these O
stories B-TER
is O
sufficient O
to O
give O
grave O
concern B-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
civilized I-TER
world I-TER
. O

So O
far O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
difficulties O
for O
Jews B-TER
wishing O
to O
flee B-TER
the O
perils O
of O
Romania B-LOC
was O
that O
the O
Turkish B-TER
Legation O
here O
was O
not O
empowered O
to O
give O
a O
transit O
visa O
unless O
the O
applicant O
could O
show O
a O
visa B-TER
for O
Palestine B-LOC
or O
Syria B-LOC
which O
the O
British B-TER
have O
not O
given O
us O
authority O
to O
grant O
, O
and O
which O
is O
not O
accorded O
to O
residents O
of O
enemy B-TER
occupied B-TER
countries I-TER
such O
as O
Romania B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
therefore O
struck O
yesterday O
when O
my O
Turkish B-TER
colleague O
called O
to O
say O
that O
he O
had O
strongly O
urged O
by O
telegram O
upon O
his O
Government B-ORG
the O
desirability O
of O
conferring O
with O
the O
British B-TER
, O
and O
, O
out O
of O
courtesy O
, O
with O
the O
French B-TER
, O
to O
see O
whether O
there O
was O
not O
some O
way O
to O
arrange O
temporary O
lodgings O
in O
barracks O
in O
Syria B-LOC
or O
Palestine B-LOC
for O
the O
unfortunate O
Jews B-TER
still O
left O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

[ O
... O
] O
I O
am O
wholly O
in O
accord O
with O
his O
proposal O
which O
, O
if O
adopted O
, O
might O
save B-TER
many O
innocent O
lives O
and O
spare O
extreme O
human O
suffering O
. O

I O
have O
no O
illusions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Romanians B-TER
will O
ever O
let O
these O
poor B-TER
people I-TER
out O
of O
their O
clutches O
with O
more O
than O
the O
clothes B-TER
on O
their O
backs O
. O

I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
inform O
that O
an O
important O
decree O
concerning O
the O
transfer B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
to O
a O
location O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
( O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
) O
has O
been O
published O
in O
the O
Collection O
of O
Laws O
and O
Decrees O
of O
the O
Reichsprotektor O
. O

With O
this O
measure B-TER
the O
Jewish B-TER
element I-TER
will O
be O
definitively O
isolated O
from O
the O
remaining O
Aryan B-TER
population O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
will O
have O
to O
be O
vacated O
by O
Aryan B-TER
citizens O
. O

The O
Reichsprotektor O
’s O
decree O
deals O
with O
this O
problem B-TER
and O
rules O
that O
no O
Aryan B-TER
person O
transferred O
elsewhere O
shall O
suffer O
any O
material B-TER
loss O
. O

All O
Aryans B-TER
living O
in O
the O
area O
chosen O
for O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC

Jewish B-TER
ghetto B-TER
will O
have O
their O
losses O
refunded O
and O
will O
be O
transferred B-TER
elsewhere O
in O
an O
appropriate O
manner O
. O

Clearly O
, O
despite O
this O
measure O
, O
those O
who O
are O
to O
be O
transferred O
will O
have O
to O
bear O
some O
sacrifices O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
all O
. O

The O
local O
press B-TER
emphasizes O
that O
these O
sacrifices O
will O
in O
any O
case O
be O
largely O
offset O
by O
the O
huge O
advantages O
that O
cleansing O

measures O
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
that O
had O
been O
announced O
have O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
seen O
a O
drastic O
implementation O
. O

Ten B-TER
thousand I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
towns O
and O
in O
villages O
had O
received O
personal O
summonses O
in O
order O
to O
be O
assembled O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

Due O
to O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
one O
may O
convert O
to O
the O
evangelical B-TER
Church I-TER
and O
because O
many O
of O
those O
summoned O
were O
aware O
that O
public O
opinion O
was O
mostly O
opposed O
to O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
campaign I-TER
, O
and O
also O
because O
rumour B-TER
had O
it O
that O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
Monsignor O
Tiso B-PER
, O
was O
indirectly O
opposed O
to O
such O
methods O
of O
persecution O
, O
many O
Jews O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
orders B-TER
given O
by O
Minister B-PER
Mach I-PER
. O

So O
in O
the O
night O
from O
23rd O
to O
24th O
March O
patrols O
formed O
by O
police B-TER
and I-TER
Guardsmen I-TER
who O
had O
been O
joined O
by O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
arrived O
from O
over O
the O
nearby O
border O
, O
entered O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
seized O
three O
thousand O
women O
aged O
18 O
to O
35 O
years O
, O
and O
carried O
them O
swiftly O
on O
a O
lorry O
to O
the O
munitions O
factory O
in O
Bratislava O
and O
to O
the O
internment O
areas O
of O
Nitra B-LOC
, O
Žilina B-LOC
, O
Prešov B-LOC
, O
etc O
. O

The O
Authorities O
closest O
to O
the O
President O
are O
denying O
or O
trying O
to O
downplay O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
events O
that O
have O
clearly O
shaken O
the O
public O
opinion O
here O
, O
although O
everyone O
knows O
that O
the O
originator O
of O
this O
undertaking O
is O
Minister B-PER
Mach I-PER
, O
Commander O
of O
the O
Hlinka B-ORG

, O
who O
is O
being O
instigated O
by O
elements O
from O
beyond O
the O
border O
and O
by O
others O
who O
oppose O
the O
President O
, O
and O
who O
accuses O
the O
Jews B-TER
themselves O
of O
being O
responsible O
for O
everything O
and O
deserving O
of O
the O
worst O
punishments O
. O

It O
is O
well O
- O
known O
that O
the O
Minister O
of O
Interior O
, O
who O
is O
entirely O
subservient O
to O
the O
orders O
from O
beyond O
the O
Danube O
, O
intends O
to O
gradually O
carry O
out O
the O
concentration O
and O
mass O
deportation O
of O
all O
the O
Israelites B-TER
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
approximately O
70 O

in O
farm O

in O
the O

However O
, O
since O
at O
least O
for O
the O
time O
being O
they O
are O
mostly O
women O
still O
in O
the O
bloom O
of O
youth O
and O
of O
good O

no O
doubt O
their O

be O
of O
an O
entirely O
different O
character O
and O
purpose O
, O
in O
the O
train O
of O
the O
German O
units O
operating O
in O
southern O
Russia O
. O

The O
announcement O
of O
harsher O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
measures O
had O
already O
prompted O
the O
Holy O
See O
to O
deliver O
a O
note O
to O
the O
Minister O
of O
Slovakia O
, O
Mister O
Sidor O
; O
the O
persecutions O
that O
have O
since O
taken O
place O
have O
then O
given O
rise O
to O
repeated O
démarches O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Apostolic O
Delegate O
, O
Monsignor O
Burzio O
, O
with O
Prime O
Minister O
Tuka B-PER
. O

As O
things O
now O
stand O
, O
the O
events O
described O
above O
have O
caused O
a O
rift O
not O
yet O
made O
public O
but O
dangerous O
between O
Prime O
Minister O
Tuka B-PER
and O
Minister B-PER
Mach I-PER
on O
the O
one O
side O
and O
President O
Tiso B-PER
on O
the O
other O
. O

The O
consequences O
are O
easy O
to O
predict O
if O
the O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
persecution O
should O
continue O
in O
the O
manner O
reported O
above O
and O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic O
, O
being O
a O
cleric O

a O

with O
the O

has O
greeted O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
action I-TER
of O

an O
indication O

the O
mood O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC

which O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
provinces O
, O
feels B-TER
no I-TER
ill I-TER
will O
towards O
Jews B-TER
and O
because O
of O
their O
meekness O

religious O
upbringing O
disagrees O
with O
the O
violent O
methods O
used O
by O
the O
men O
carrying O
out O
the O

There O
have O
even O
been O
instances O

which O
local O

have O
not O
carried O
out O

carried O
out O
only O

subjected O
to O
an O

Church B-TER

also O
objected O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
the O

There O
has O
indeed O
been O
such O
a O
step O
and O
the O
Chargé O

has O
repeatedly O
seen O
the O
Prime B-PER
Minister I-PER
and O
Minister O

Foreign O
Affairs O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
have O
been O
critical O
voices O
against O
Mach B-PER
within O
the O
Government B-TER
itself O
, O
coming O
from O
his O
colleagues O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-ORG
people I-ORG

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
forced B-TER
exodus I-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
continued O
and O
continues O
still O
. O

It O
is O
illegal O
, O
as O
no O
law O
authorizing O
it O
exists O
. O

There O
is O
– O
for O
now O
– O
only O
a O
bill B-TER
approved O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
by O
the O
Council O
of O
Minister O
which O
has O
still O
to O
be O
submitted O
to O
Parliament O

The O
full O
powers O
granted O
by O
Parliament O
to O
the O
Government B-TER
in O
1940 O
to O
proceed O
against O
Jews B-TER
can O
not O
possibly O
apply O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
exodus O
. O

As O
I O
have O
learned O
from O
Minister O
Mach B-PER
himself O
, O
of O
the O
90,000 O
Jews B-TER
who O
were O
in O
Slovakia B-LOC
on O
25th O
March O
last O
( O
in O
1939 O
there O
were O
120,000 O
, O
30,000 O
of O
whom O
have O
voluntarily O
left O
the O
country O
after O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
independent O
Slovak O
State O
) O
, O
13,000 O
have O
been O
deported B-TER
these O
past O
weeks O
to O
the O
Katowice B-LOC
area O
and O
to O
the O
General B-LOC
Governorate I-LOC
and O
those O
remaining O
will O
follow O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
6 O
months O
. O

Mach B-PER
told O
me O
“ O
The O
Jews B-TER
were O
dominating O
our O
economy B-TER
” O
, O
and O
ended O
by O
saying O
that O
to O
remedy O
such O
a O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
the O
time O
for O
half O
measures O
is O
over O
. O

When O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
acted O
because O
forced O
to O
do O
so O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
the O
Minister B-PER
of I-PER
Interior I-PER
declared O
to O
the O
press B-TER
, O
as O
reported O
with O
Cable O
no O
. O

1095/245 O
from O
27th O
March O
, O
that O
the O
expulsion O
of O
Jews B-TER
had O
been O
decided O
“ O
spontaneously O
and O
with O
full O
persuasion O
” O
. O

I O
have O
been O
told O
by O
the O
German B-TER
Minister O
here O
that O
his O
Government B-TER
had O
not O
used O
any O
pressure O
but O
had O
simply O
made O
a O
suggestion O
that O
had O
been O
accepted O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
the O
President B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Republic I-PER
has O
done O
his O
utmost O
to O
mitigate O
the O
harshness O
of O
the O
methods O
employed O
for O
the O
exodus B-TER
and O
made O
use O
, O
despite O
a O
strong O
opposition B-TER
from O
the O
Prime B-PER
Minister I-PER
himself O
, O
of O
the O
right O
to O
discriminate O
granted O
him O
by O
the O
“ O
Jewish O
Code O
” O
in O
order O
to O
save O
a O
great O
many O
persons O
from O
expulsion O
. O

Clearly O
, O
if O
President B-PER
Tiso I-PER
has O
not O
done O
more O
and O
has O
even O
prevented O
a O
press B-TER
controversy O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
from O
breaking O
out O
( O
all O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
press B-TER
, O
belatedly O
, O
were O
two O
critical O
articles O
in O
the O
Catholic O
newspapers B-TER
Slovak O
and O
Slovenska O
Pravda O
) O
, O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
finds O
himself O
unable O
to O
oppose O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Reich B-TER
, O
which O
has O
in O
Tuka B-PER

, O
particularly O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
, O
willing O
and O

It O
is O
also O
likely O
that O
Monsignor O
Tiso B-PER
judges O
that O
under O
any O
circumstances O
he O
can O
be O
more O
useful O

Herein O
lies O
precisely O
the O
interest O

after O
the O

We O
will O
not O
desist O
from O
the O
struggle O
– O
said O
Kállay O
– O
until O
with O
a O
systematic O
and O
ever O
increasing O
pace O
we O
have O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
Jews O
every O
sector O

national O
life O
and O
we O
have O
at O

entirely O
removed O
them O
from O
our O

In O
order O
to O
appreciate O
the O
significance O

these O
words O
and O
to O
understand O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
situation O
to O

they O

might O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
briefly O
reconsider O
the O
fundamental O
aspects O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER

in O

Among O
the O
other O
misfortunes O
which O
befell O
this O

at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Turkish B-LOC
invasion O
there O
was O
also O
the O
influx O
of O
many O
Jews B-TER
who O
found O
a O
favourable O
situation O
under O
the O
Crescent O
. O

The O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Turks B-TER
caused O
most O
of O
them O
to O
leave O

Later O

the O
severe O
decrees O
of O
the O
Habsburgs O
, O
particularly O
Charles B-PER
III I-PER
and O
Maria B-PER
Theresa I-PER
, O
helped O
to O
keep O
the O
Jews B-TER
away O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Between O
1820 O
and O
1830 O
, O
however O
, O
there O
began O
that O
exodus O
of O
Jews B-TER
from O
Galicia B-LOC
to O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
territory O
which O
would O
continue O
uninterrupted O
into O

encouraged O
by O
the O
rise O
of O

by O
the O

from O
April O
1938 O

The O

avoided O

The O

prompted O
the O
second O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O

, O
whose O
fundamental O
principles O
are O
derived O
from O
the O
Italian B-LOC
anti B-TER

Jewish I-TER
law I-TER
of O
10th O
November O
1939 O
[ O

and O
which O
, O
in O

the O
definition O
of O
Jew B-TER
according O
to O
fundamentally O
racial O
criteria O
, O
contains O
– O
numerous O
exceptions O
notwithstanding O
– O
severe O
measures O
. O

The O
law B-TER
reduces O
voting O
rights O
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
excludes O
Jews B-TER
from O
the O
Lower O
Chamber O
; O
limits O
the O

of O
Jews B-TER
in O
secondary O
schools O
, O
in O

in O
professional O

to O

A O

law B-TER

forbade O
marriage B-TER

the O
Kállay B-PER
Government O

which O
came O

has O
decreed O
the O
confiscation B-TER

The O
latest O
decree O
of O
considerable O
importance O
is O
the O
one O
approved O
by O
the O
Chamber O
on O
1st O
May O
, O
which O
rules O
that O
as O
from O
that O
date O
the O
Jewish B-TER
persuasion O
ceases O
to O
be O
officially O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
state I-LOC
. O

Some O
facts O
emerge O
from O
what O
has O
been O
said O
here O
that O
place O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
in O
its O
true O
perspective O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
main O
factor O
that O
encouraged O
the O
Jewish B-TER
invasion O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
is O
still O
far O
from O
having O
vanished O
needs O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
absence O
, O
in O
the O
social O
structure O
of O
this O
Country O
, O
of O
an O
urban O
middle O
class O
that O
might O
carry O
out O
the O
functions O
and O
the O
tasks O
that O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

This O
explains O
why O
it O
is O
fairly O
easy O
to O
implement O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
law I-TER
in O
the O
countryside O
, O
where O
the O
aristocracy O
and O
the O
landed O
middle O
classes O
are O
still O
active O
and O
significant O
forces O
, O
whereas O
it O
remains O
difficult O
to O
do O
the O
same O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
particularly O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
immediate O
removal O
, O
supposing O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
, O
of O
all O
Jews B-TER
holding O
managing O
posts O
in O
industry B-TER
, O
commerce O
and O
banks B-TER
would O
cause O
a O
crisis O
that O
would O
overwhelm O
the O
Hungarian O
economy O
. O

Only O
by O
gradually O
and O
simultaneously O
inserting O
Hungarian B-LOC
elements O
that O
are O
capable O
of O
occupying B-TER
the O
posts O
at O
present O
held O
by O
Jews B-TER
will O
Hungary B-LOC
be O
able O
to O
face O
the O
actual O
expulsions O
of O
the O
latter O
from O
the O
most O
vital O
hubs O
of O
its O
economic O
structure O
. O

This O
necessity O
highlights O
another O
delicate O
aspect O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
is O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
them O
, O
Hungary B-LOC
can O
not O
do O
without O
the O
, O
albeit O
limited O
, O
cooperation O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
can O
not O
be O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
this O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
part O
of O
its O
population O
and O
as O
to O
the O
influence O
it O
has O
on O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
since O
an O
immediate O
and O
complete O
solution O
of O
the O
problem O
looks O
impossible O
, O
the O
Hungarian O
Government O
intends O
to O
continue O
to O
keep O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
alive O
and O
open O
; O
its O
final O
conclusion O
, O
as O
President O
Kalláy B-PER
said O
in O
his O
latest O
speech O
, O
will O
be O
removal O
outside O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
of O
all O
the O
800,000 O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
the O
Country O
. O

As O
I O
already O
said O
, O
the O
numerous O
mixed B-TER
marriages I-TER
entered O
into O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
served O
them O
well O
in O
strengthening O
their O
position O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
that O
in O
joining O
their O
power O
to O
that O
of O
many O
aristocratic O
and O
middle O
class O
families O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Hungary B-LOC
have O
created O
a O
network O
of O
shared O
interests O
and O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
very O
social O
classes O
that O
ought O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

And O
they O
have O
contributed O
not O
a O
little O
to O
the O
spreading O
of O
the O
liberal O
ideology O
, O
which O
in O
this O
Country O
is O
perhaps O
more O
enduring O
than O
in O
others O
. O

The O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
therefore O
poses O
for O
Hungary B-LOC
a O
distressful O
and O
difficult O
problem O
as O
it O
closely O
concerns O
its O
social O
structure O
and O
its O
economic O
organization O
, O
and O
this O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Country O
needs O
all O
its O
energies O
to O
face O
its O
new O
and O
important O
tasks O
. O

This O
explains O
the O
hesitancy O
apparent O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
action I-TER
and O
a O
certain O
scepticism O
displayed O
even O
today O
by O
many O
towards O
the O
effectiveness O
and O
even O
towards O
the O
sincerity O
of O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
policies I-TER
, O
But O
the O
Government O
’s O
will O
to O
advance O
on O
the O
road O
it O
has O
in O
part O
already O
covered O
does O
not O
appear O
in O
doubt O
and O
it O
may O
not O
be O
unnecessary O
to O
point O
out O
that O
considerations O
and O
influences O
of O
an O
international B-TER
nature I-TER
are O
not O
without O
bearing O
on O
this O
will O
. O

The O

the O

it O
became O

A O
first O
step O
was O
therefore O
to O
declare O
null O

void O
all O

entered O
into O
between O
Jews O
and O
between O
Jews O

others O
in O
the O
60 O

the O
declaration O
of O
the O
Independent O

if O
the O
value O

the O
contract O

That O

foreign O

5th O

all O

that O

With O
this O

any O

the O

Jewish O

The O
final O
decision O
in O
all O
these O
cases O
lies O
with O

Lastly O
, O
with O
the O
Decree O
of O
10th O
October O
1941 O
, O
the O
authority O
on O
all O
matters O
concerning O
the O
estates O
of O
individual O
Jews B-TER
or O
of O
Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
has O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
which O
may O
, O
with O
a O
discretionary O
decision O
that O
admits O
no O
recourse O
, O
nationalize O
the O
assets O
of O
any O
Jew B-TER
as O
well O
as O
of O
any O
Jewish O
business O
and O
determine O
what O
compensation O
, O
if O
any O
, O
shall O
be O
paid O
and O
how O
. O

The O
estates O
thus O
acquired O
can O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
or O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
. O

Recently O
this O
Department O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
have O
been O
eliminated O
and O
all O
authority O
in O
matters O
concerning O
Jewish O
economic O
questions O
and O
the O
assessment O
of O
race O
has O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
Office O
for O
Nationalized O
Assets O
, O
and O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
Affairs O
respectively O
. O

The O
implementation O
of O
all O
these O
measures O
has O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
been O
very O
easy O
. O

Croatian O
public O
opinion O
, O
being O
insufficiently O
prepared O
for O
a O
racial O
campaign O
and O
still O
wary O
of O
the O
new O
Regime O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
shaken O
by O
a O
string O
of O
illegal O
acts O
carried O
out O
by O
unscrupulous O
Ustashe B-TER
officials I-TER
, O
had O
a O
rather O
negative O
reaction O
against O
these O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
and O
watched O
the O
course O
of O
events O
with O
great O
scepticism O
. O

From O
a O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
, O
which O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
the O
buttress O
of O
the O
entire O
system O
, O
and O
whose O
task O
it O
was O
basically O
to O
centralize O
and O
draw O
up O
an O
inventory O
of O
all O
Jewish B-TER
property I-TER
, O
proved O
decidedly O
inferior O
to O
the O
task O
they O
had O
been O
entrusted O
with O
, O
both O
because O
their O
offices O
were O
disorganized O
and O
because O
its O
officials O
had O
absolutely O
no O
experience O
in O
such O
matters O
. O

This O
state O
of O
affairs O
was O
taken O
advantage O
of O
by O
elements O
of O
the O
German O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
who O
, O
through O
their O
financial O
organizations O
, O
were O
able O
to O
acquire O
legally O
the O
main O
formerly O
Jewish O
businesses O
. O

Lastly O
, O
as O
to O
the O
present O
situation O
of O
Croats B-TER
who O
own O
formerly O
Jewish B-TER
property I-TER
, O
it O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
they O
have O
acquired O
it O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
but O
mainly O
through O
a O
system O
of O
fictitious O
sales O
carried O
out O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
persons O
appointed O
by O
the O
State O
to O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
said O
property O
. O

Of O
the O
40,000 O
Jews O
who O
, O
it O
has O
been O
estimated O
, O
were O
living O
in O
Croatian O
territory O
, O
only O
approx O
. O

6,000 O
are O
left O
, O
almost O
all O
interned O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
or O
assigned O
to O
farm O
work O
or O
to O
land O
reclamation O
. O

Of O
the O
rest O
, O
some O
have O
managed O
to O
emigrate O
and O
some O
must O
be O
considered O
missing O
. O

The O
Jewish O
problem O
can O
therefore O
be O
considered O
virtually O
solved O
in O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia B-TER
; O
a O
few O
issues O
still O
remain O
pending O
, O
such O
for O
instance O
as O
mixed O
marriages O
, O
but O
they O
too O
will O
soon O
be O
dealt O
with O
and O
settled O
. O

Giustiniani B-PER
Just O
like O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
, O
a O
number O
of O
special O
provisions B-TER
apply O
to O

in O
Ostland B-TER

These O

are O
only O
to O
a O
very O
limited O
extent O
drawn O
up O
by O
the O
administrative B-TER

Thus O
, O
only O
a O
single O
related O
regulation O
is O
seen O
to O
have O
been O
issued O
by O
the O
Minister B-ORG

see O
below O

B.VIII O

the O
Office O

the O
Commissioner O

essentially O
confines O
himself O
to O
an O
Order O
of O
13 O
October O
of O
the O

, O
regarding O
the O
Treatment O
of O
Jewish B-TER
Wealth I-TER

the O
State O
Commission O

The O
Area O
Commissioners O
or O
the O
Self- O
Government B-TER
administrative O
Authorities O
have O
drafted O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
provisions O
, O
and O
many O
of O
these O
Provisions O
are O
hardly O
published O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
regulations B-TER
in O
question O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
access O
for O
the O
legation O
, O
and O
there O
may O
also O
be O
some O
minor O
differences O
in O
the O
rules O
at O
the O
various O
locations O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
the O
legation O
will O
refer O
to O
some O
of O
the O
special B-TER
provisions I-TER
applicable O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Ostland B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
the O
foregoing O
, O
it O
is O
not O
certain O
that O
all O
the O
rules O
made O
under O
B. O
IV O
to O
VII O
apply O
throughout O
Ostland B-TER
. O

However O
, O
the O
envoy O
has O
intended O
to O
refrain O
from O
conducting O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
they O
are O
applicable O
everywhere O
, O
as O
their O
applicability O
in O
most O
places O
is O
undoubted O
, O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
more O
the O
general O
principles O
which O
have O
been O
adopted O
by O
the O
authorities B-TER
. O

The O
following O
draws O
upon O
some O
of O
the O
Special B-TER
Provisions I-TER
of O
Interest O
. O

A. O
So O
far O
there O
is O
no O
provision B-TER
for O
what O
is O
meant O
by O
the O
term O
' O
Jew B-TER
' O
. O

However O
, O
one O
would O
assume O
that O
the O
rules O
of O
this O
term O
in O
Ostland B-TER
, O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
ones B-TER
used O
in O

In O

( O
Telegram O
# O
34 O
of O
June O
of O
last O
year O
) O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Foreign O
Affairs O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
it O
should O
not O
make O
Jews B-TER
into O
a O
question O
. O

Since O
then O
in O
many O
countries O
in O
Europe B-LOC
persecution B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
has O
worsened O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
is O
the O
same O
even O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
been O
considered O
their O
paradise O
/ O
haven O
. O

Therefore O
, O
when O
the O
war O
is O
over O
, O
many O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
will O
leave B-TER
Europe B-LOC

in O
that O
case O
we O
should O
pay O
attention O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n’t O
flow O
into O
Greater B-TER
East I-TER
Asia I-TER
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
while O
building O
Greater B-TER
East I-TER
Asia I-TER
, O
from O
now O
on O
we O
need O
to O
diligently O
pay O
close O
attention O
so O
as O
to O
eliminate O
the O
Jewish O
influence O
entrenched O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
East O
Asia O
starting O
from O
Shanghai B-LOC
to O
the O
extent O
possible O
and O
to O
eradicate O
their O
foundation O

At O
the O

they O
are O
bound O
to O
engage O
in O
Fifth B-TER
Column I-TER
type I-TER
of I-TER
activities I-TER
for O
the O

so O
we O
need O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
all O
Jews B-TER
regardless O
of O
their O

Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER

which O
has O
repeatedly O
been O
the O
object O
of O
drastic O
measures B-TER

is O
now O
entering O
a O
new O
stage O
that O
might O
be O
the O
conclusive O
one O

at O
the O
disposal O
of O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
in O
the O
occupied B-TER
Oriental I-TER
territories I-TER
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
a O
plan O
of O
which O
I O
have O
already O
reported O
on O
another O
occasion O
. O

As O
for O
Zagreb B-LOC
, O
a O
poster O
put O
up O
in O
the O
streets O
on O
27th O
July O
last O
requested O
all O
Jews B-TER
, O
regardless O
of O
their O
subjectship O
, O
to O
report O
to O
police B-TER
authorities I-TER
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
this O
decree B-TER
has O
been O
withdrawn O
. O

This O
is O
evidently O
a O
setback O
, O
which O
has O
given O
rise O
in O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
to O
various O
comments O
that O
are O
not O
worthy O
of O
being O
repeated O
, O
and O
at O
the O

time O
leaves O
the O
question O
unaltered O
and O
, O
as O
before O

heading O
for O
a O
solution O
that O
neither O

Re O
: O
Treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
As O
this O
Royal O
Legation O
reported O
in O
the O
telegram O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
transfer O
to O
Poland B-LOC
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
survivors O
left O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
is O
currently O
under O
way O
. O

The O
transfer O
is O
carried O
out O
with O
special O
trains B-TER
provided O
by O
Croatian B-LOC
authorities O
, O
who O
, O
besides O
equipping O
the O
people O
who O
are O
leaving O
, O
are O
also O
required O
to O
pay O
the O
Government B-TER
of O
the O
Reich B-TER
30 O
Mark O
per O
person O
. O

( O
Initially O
the O
Reich B-TER
had O
requested O
500 O
Mark O
) O
. O

The O
said O
measures O
have O
led O
to O
a O
démarche O
– O
as O
the O
Poglavnik B-PER
himself O
has O
confirmed O
– O
by O
the O
Apostolic O
Delegate O
here O
, O
which O
brought O
no O
conclusive O
results O
. O

It O
seems O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
category O
formed O
by O
Aryans B-TER
joined O
in O
matrimony O
to O
Jews B-TER
will O
be O
left O
alone O
. O

The O
Minister O
of O
Germany O
here O
, O
in O
a O
conversation O
he O
had O
with O
the O
R. O
Minister O
about O
various O
issues O
, O
hinted O
at O
the O
advisability O
of O
starting O
to O
remove O
also O
the O
Jews B-TER
who O
have O
sought O
shelter O
in O
the O
2nd O
zone O
occupied O
by O
Italian B-LOC
troops B-TER
and O
asked O
how O
many O
there O
might O
be O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the O
larger O
groups B-TER
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
is O
was O
aware O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
Mostar B-LOC
, O
in O
Ragusa B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Dubrovnik I-LOC
] I-LOC
and O
in O
Cirquenizza B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Crikvenica I-LOC
] I-LOC
. O

Lastly O
, O
he O
hinted O
at O
an O
official O
step O
that O
the O
Government B-TER
of O
the O
Reich B-TER
is O
about O
to O
make O
in O
order O
to O
request O
that O
these O
Jews B-TER
, O
like O
the O
others O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
, O
be O
also O
sent O
to O
Poland B-LOC

concerning O
Mrs. O
Martha O
Hagen O
. O

I O
understand O
, O
that O
in O
Danish B-LOC
circles O
, O
where O
the O
German B-LOC
attitude B-TER
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
, O
we O
can O
be O
somewhat O
disappointed O
with O
the O
weak O
results O
in O
these O
cases O
and O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
we O
are O
too O
reluctant O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
envoy O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
like O
to O
try O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
to O
redress O
our O
difficulties O
. O

The O
official O
German B-TER
attitude I-TER
towards O
the O
Jews B-TER
gradually O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
severe O
as O
the O
war B-TER
progresses O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
are O
seen O
as O
the O
enemies O
of O
the O
People O
and O
they O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
, O
at O
best O
through O
isolation O
in O
ghettos B-TER
in O
the O
designated O
areas O
. O

This O
attitude O
applies O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
as O
a O
race B-TER
without O
regard O
to O
citizenship B-TER
, O
and O
the O
goal O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
similar O
to O
the O
German O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
also O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
foreign B-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
Germany O
are O
spared O
some O
of O
the O
most O
rigorous O
provisions B-TER
, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
non O
- O
German O
Jews B-TER
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
must O
be O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
nationalsocialist I-TER
. O

Both O
German O
and O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
were O
generally O
allowed O
to O
travel B-TER
earlier O
- O
so O
they O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
- O
, O
but O
as O
the O
war O
progressed O
, O
another O
consideration O
became O
more O
and O
more O
applicable O
: O
The O
fear O
of O
information B-TER
about O
conditions O
in O
this O
country O
being O
spread O
across O
the B-TER
world I-TER
, O
which O
could O
damage O
Germany B-TER
's I-TER
position O
and O
bring O
substance O
to O
the O
anti- O
nationalsocialist B-TER
propaganda B-TER
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
preferable O
not O
to O
see O
too O
much O
traffic O
across O
the O
borders O
, O
by O
persons O
who O
are O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
reliable B-TER
politically I-TER
– O
apart O
from O
the O
difficulties O
of O
permits O
for O
entry O
and O
exit O
in O
general O
- O
and O
for O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
who O
are O
all O
considered O
100%-unreliable O
, O
we O
now O
see O
an O
almost O
completely O
shut O
down O
. O

While O
there O
are O
still O
exceptions O
made O
for O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
it O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
for O
German O
Jews B-TER
to O
travel O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
acquired O
foreign O
citizenship B-TER
by O
marriage B-TER
, O
especially O
when O
the O
marriage O
took O
place O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
Jewish O
law O
, O
which O
is O
the O
case O
both O
with O
the O
married O
couple O
Hagen O
and O
with O
marriage O
of O
Thomsen O
in O
Schøn O
’s O
letter O
of O
7 O
August O
to O
Ryder O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
Jewish B-TER
laws I-TER
, O
several O
female B-TER
German O
Jews B-TER
married O
foreigners O
. O

The O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
regard O
all O
these O
marriages O
as O
concluded O
solely O
for O
trying O
to O
circumvent O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
motives O
behind O
the O
marriages O
are O
self O
- O
evident O
( O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
man O
from O
acting O
on O
the O
noblest O
and O
most O
humane O
motives B-TER
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
according O
to O
German B-TER
opinion O
, O
mixing O
Aryan B-TER
and O
Jewish B-TER
blood O
is O
a O
crime B-TER
, O
and O
that O
marriages B-TER
between O
Aryans B-TER
and O
Jews B-TER
are O
forbidden O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
believe O
that O
we O
are O
wise O
to O
leave O
these O
cases O
as O
hopeless O
and O
save O
the O
very O
poor O
‘ O
goodwill O
’ O
we O
have O
for O
cases O
about O
Danish B-LOC
Jews B-TER
with O
Connection O
to O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

Even O
for O
their O
part O
, O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
, O
since O
the O
German O
side O
expects O
that O
the O
government B-TER
of O
a O
neighbouring O
country O
shows O
an O
understanding B-TER
of O
the O
German O
attitude O
, O

Letter O
of O
28 O
April O
to O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
regarding O
Articles O
in O
the O
' O
Kamptegnet B-TER
' O
, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
illustrative O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
you O
suggest O
allowing O
the O
Consulate O
General O
to O
go O
to O
the O
police B-TER
has O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
great O
caution O
. O

In O
several O
cases O
, O
the O
police O
have O
rejected B-TER
such O
requests O
from O
the O
Consulate O
General O
and O
wanted O
the O
issue O
to O
go O
the O
diplomatic B-TER
way O
. O

We O
have O
also O
seen O
that O
the O
police O
authorities O
have O
said O
to O
the O
Consulate O
General O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
look O
after O
the O
person O
if O
she O
continued O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
applications O
. O

We O
hereby O
reach O
a O
point O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
has O
n’t O
had O
much O
attention B-TER
at O
home O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
persons O
seeking O
our O
and O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
` I-ORG
assistance O
have O
tried O
all O
possible O
ways O
. O

The O
result O
easily O
becomes O
an O
Irritation O
to O
the O
Authorities O
, O
which O
may O
cause O
fatal O
consequences O
for O
the O
persons O
concerned O
. O

There O
is O
a O
risk O
that O
the O
authorities O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
more O
nonsense O
, O
will O
send B-TER
those O
concerned O
to O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
or O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
1 O
) O
that O
the O
relatively O
gentle O
treatment O
of O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
in O
part O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
sharper O
course O
and O
2 O
) O
that O
the O
question O
of O
precautionary O
measures B-TER
against O
Jews B-TER
in O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
relevant O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
of O
no O
use O
that O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
more O
famous O
than O
most O
necessary O
as O
a O
Jewish B-TER
sanctuary O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
allow O
you O
to O
recommend O
that O
you O
explain O
to O
Mr. O
Hagen O
, O
that O
by O
pushing O
more O
on O
applications O
for O
the O
wife O
's O
exit O
permit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
through O
us O
as O
directly O
to O
the O
German O
authorities O
, O
will O
risk O
doing O
her O
more O
harm O
than O
good O

Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
seem O
determined O
to O
solve O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
with O
drastic O
measures B-TER
, O
sending B-TER
a O
great O
number O
of O
Semtic B-TER
elements O
to O
the O
occupied B-TER
Russian B-LOC
territories O
. O

These O
deportations B-TER
had O
already O
started O
during O
last O
winter O
and O
involved O
the O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
Bukovina B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
accused O
of O
having O
welcomed O
the O
Bolshevik B-TER
occupation I-TER
, O
and O
those O
in O
Moldavia B-LOC
, O
who O
during O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
war B-TER
had O
stirred O
up O
Communist B-TER
riots O
in O
Jassy B-LOC
and O
in O
Galatz B-LOC
that O
were O
immediately O
suppressed O
. O

The O
system O
now O
has O
been O
extended O
to O
other O
regions O
and O
towns O
, O
including O
the O
capital B-LOC
, O
where O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
the O
police B-TER
have O
carried O
out O
vast O
round O

ups O
among O
the O
Jewish O
element O
and O
have O
sent O
the O
people O
arrested O
beyond O
the O
Dnestr B-LOC

beyond O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
are O
employed B-TER
in O
public O
works O
, O
mainly O
road O
works O
, O
but O
reportedly O
last O
winter O
many O
, O
due O
also O
to O
lack O
of O
equipment O
and O
of O
suitable O
lodgings O
, O
did O
not O
survive O
the O
long O
marches B-TER
from O
one O
place O
to O
the O
other O
and O
the O
rigours O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
winter O
. O

News O
of O
these O
measures B-TER
spread O
rapidly O
even O
abroad O
, O
causing O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
send O
a O
protest B-TER
note I-TER
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Legation I-ORG
which O
here O
protects O
their O
interests O

However O
, O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
government B-TER
, O
during O
the O
last O
meeting O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
decided O
to O
ignore O
the O
American O

to O
carry O
on O

the O

To O
this O
end O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
to O
be O
sent O
beyond O
the O

have O
been O
classed O

In O
the O

the O
anti B-TER

Semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
are O
designed O
instead O
to O
do O

dangerous O

the O

Reports O
received O
from O

on O
November O
13 O
, O
1942 O
, O
indicate O
that O
this O
law B-TER
is O
being O
rigorously O
enforced O
. O

Previous O
reports O
that O
there O
was O
some O
lenity O
in O
the O
enforcement O
of O
the O
law O
applied O
only O
to O
a O
small O
number O
of O
Christian B-TER
Jews I-TER
with O
regard O
to O
wearing O
the O
Star B-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
. O

Also O
some O
postponement O
was O
found O
necessary O
due O
to O
the O
physical O
impossibility O
of O
moving O
so O
many O
Jews B-TER
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
or O
deporting B-TER
them O
at O
one O
time O
. O

A O
prominent O
Jewish B-TER
surgeon I-TER
arrived O
in O
Istanbul B-LOC
from O
Sofia B-LOC
on O
November O
12 O
after O
having O
been O
deprived B-TER
of I-TER
his I-TER
right I-TER
to I-TER
practice I-TER
his I-TER
profession I-TER
. O

He O
owned O
and O
operated O
a O
hospital B-TER
and I-TER
clinic I-TER
, O
which O
is O
forbidden O
to O
Jews B-TER
in O
accordance O
with O
Article O
33 O
of O
the O
Law B-TER
. O

All O
his O
property B-TER
was O
taken O
away O
from O
him O
. O

Actually O
this O
man O
is O
a O
Catholic B-TER
and O
has O
been O
such O
for O
thirty O
- O
five O
years O
. O

He O
declared O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
severe O
treatment O
is O
the O
jealousy B-TER
of O
Bulgarian B-TER
surgeons B-TER
and I-TER
doctors I-TER
who O
take O
this O
means O
of O
ridding O
themselves O
of O
competition O
. O

As O
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
several O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
are O
now O
in O
the O
process O
of O
being O
deported B-TER
from O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

Where O
they O
will O
be O
sent O
is O
not O
known O
. O

They O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
deported B-TER
to O
towns O
and O
villages O
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC
but O
some O
high O
placed O
persons O
believe O
many O
of O
them O
will O
be O
deported B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Some O
think O
they O
will O
be O
put O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
inside O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
where O
many O
will O
eventually O
die O
of O
disease B-TER
and O
starvation B-TER
. O

Others O
, O
including O
the O
surgeon B-TER
referred O
to O
above O
, O
think O
that O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
them O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
, O
as O
they O
have O
been O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC
and O
other O
cities O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
content O
of O
the O
law O
, O
together O
with O
the O
severity O
with O
which O
it O
is O
being O
enforced O
show O
that O
its O
purpose O
is O
the O
complete O
destruction O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
in O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

“ O
Budapest B-LOC

born O
1909 O
- O
1918 O
for O
duty O
work B-TER
battalions O
auxiliary O
military B-TER
service I-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
It O
is O
believed O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
will O
be O
sent O
to O
occupied O
Russian B-LOC
territory O
for O
manual B-TER
labor I-TER
as O
has O
been O
the O
case O
with O
Jews B-TER
from O
other O
Danubian O
countries O
. O

The O
eventual O
repatriation O
of O
Jews B-TER
deported B-TER
to O
the O
East O
would O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
envisaged O
by O
the O
present O
Hungarian B-TER
Government I-TER
which O
has O
recently O
intensified O
under O
Nazi O
inspiration O
its O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
program I-TER
. O

It O
seems O
that O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
are O
becoming O
more O
stringent O
in O
administration B-TER
and O
that O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
propaganda I-TER
increases O
upon O
the O
eastern O
front O
. O

This O
activity O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
encouraged O
by O
those O
Romanians B-TER
who O
have O
benefited O
from O
the O
confiscations B-TER
of I-TER
Jewish I-TER
property I-TER
and O
their O
forced O
retirement B-TER
from O
Romanian B-TER
public O
life O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
question O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Romania B-LOC
and O
the O
war O
against O
Soviet O
Russia O
are O
linked O
together O
, O
as O
in O
all O
Axis B-TER
States I-TER
. O

This O
attitude O
is O
claimed O
by O
competent O
observers O
to O
be O
greatly O
encouraged O
by O
the O
Romanian B-TER
aristocrats O
, O
business O
and O
professional O
men O
, O
who O
are O
behind O
the O
Government B-TER
in O
this O
attempt O
. O

The O
explanation O
offered O
for O
the O
support O
of O
these O
classes O
to O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
propaganda I-TER
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
are O
the O
chief O
beneficiaries O
of O
the O
expropriations B-TER
of O
Jewish B-TER
owned O
properties O
in O
Romania B-LOC
and O
that O
the O
control O
of O
the O
economic O
and O
financial O
life O
of O
the O
country O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Jews B-TER
were O
claimed O
to O
have O
a O
great O
interest O
, O
has O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
other O
Romanians B-TER
. O

What O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
press B-TER
of O
neutral B-TER
countries I-TER
, O
namely O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
said O
to O
be O
negotiating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
Germany B-TER
and O
with O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
concerning O
the O
removal O
from O
Bulgaria B-LOC
of O
significant O
groups O
of O
press B-TER
of O
Israelites B-TER
, I-TER
is O
true O
. O

Germany B-TER
has O
offered O
to O
transfer O
the O
Bulgarian O
Jewish B-TER
groups I-TER
to O
the O
ghettoes B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
has O
asked O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
pay O
the O
sum O
of O
five O
- O
hundred O
marks O
per O
person O
for O
transport O
costs O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
property O
seized O
locally O
. O

Bulgarians B-TER
have O
resisted O
this O
request O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
nothing O
has O
been O
decided O
as O
yet O
on O
the O
financial O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
departures O
of O
Jews B-TER
for O
Poland B-LOC
have O
already O
begun O
, O
albeit O
limited O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
groups I-TER
living O
in O
the O
new O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territories O
, O
Thrace B-LOC
and O
Macedonia B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
are O
Jewish B-TER
communities I-TER
that O
have O
been O
estimated O
at O
approx O
. O

twenty O
- O
thousand O
individuals O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
ancient O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territory O
nothing O
definite O
has O
been O
decided O
, O
because O
reportedly O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
opposing O
a O
marked O
resistance B-TER
. O

With O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
there O
have O
been O
negotiations O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Government I-ORG
about O
dispatching O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
four O
- O
thousand O
adult O
Bulgarian B-TER
Jews B-TER
and O
four O
- O
thousand O
Jewish B-TER
children O
. O

But O
the O
Reich B-TER
has O
stepped O
in O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
has O
“ O
vetoed O
” O
this O
departure O
, O
judging O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
that O
it O
is O
dangerous O
to O
transfer O
to O
an O
enemy O
territory O
such O
decidedly O
anti O
- O
German O
elements O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
apparently O
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
has O
resumed O
these O
negotiations O
despite O
that O
“ O
veto O
” O
, O
limiting O
them O
to O
the O
four O
- O
thousand O
children O
who O
would O
be O
accompanied O
by O
no O
more O
than O
five O
- O
hundred O
adults O
. O

This O
negotiation O
as O
well O
, O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
encounter O
problems O
of O
a O
financial O
nature O

The O

have O

excluded B-TER
from I-TER
any I-TER

and O
have O
for O
over O
a O

the O

unable O

it O
for O

Their O
entire O
property B-TER

who O

Several O
sources O
confirm O
that O
their O
transfer B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
should O
start O
anytime O
now O
. O

German B-TER
authorities I-TER
have O
requested O
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
a O
list O
of O
120 O
prominent O
persons O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
hostages O

In O
this O
list O
there O
are O
also O
12 O
Italian O
citizens O
of O
Jewish B-TER
race I-TER
who O
, O
together O
with O
the O
others O
, O
were O
summoned O
on O
the O
7th O
inst O
. O

to O
the O
Community`s B-TER
premises O
where O
a O
German O
officer O
gave O
a O
short O
speech O
and O
explained O
that O
they O
would O
answer O
with O
their O
own O
persons O
for O
any O
accident O
or O
act B-TER
of I-TER
sabotage I-TER
that O
might O
occur O
. O

He O
added O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
his O
duty O
to O
intern O
them O
at O
once O
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
but O
that O
due O
to O
the O
assurances O
given O
by O
the O
Chief O
Rabbi B-TER
he O
would O
let O
them O
stay O
free O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

The O
said O
prominent O
persons O
are O
also O
required O
to O
provide O
out O
of O
their O
own O
means O
for O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
poorer O
Jews B-TER
. O

I O
have O
approached O
the O
Befehlshaber B-TER
and O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
his O
assurance O
that O
the O
Italian O
citizens O
will O
be O
removed O
from O
said O
list O
and O
we O
reached O
an O
understanding O
that O
they O
will O
no O
longer O
comply O
with O
the B-TER
instructions I-TER
and I-TER
the I-TER
orders I-TER
they O
should O
still O
receive O
through O
the O
Jewish B-TER

Due O
to O
the O
zeal O
displayed O
by O
the O
offices O
in O
charge O

carrying O
out O
the O
adopted B-TER
measures I-TER

I O
find O
myself O
compelled O
all O

steps O
to O
prevent O
our O
fellow O

citizens O
from O

hampered O
in O
their O
usual O
commercial O
activity O

Until O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only O
inevitable O
repercussions O
of O
a O
very O
limited O
and O
modest O
relevance O

The O
sudden O
removal O
from O

over O
50 O
thousand O
people O
, O
who O
for O
centuries O
had O
continuously O
been O
engaged O

important B-TER

, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O

A O
great O
many O
services O
that O
were O
provided O
almost O
exclusively B-TER
by I-TER
Jews I-TER
are O
now O
missing O

and O
the O
price O
of O
commodities O
has O
increased O
sharply O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
the O
local O
press B-TER
has O
been O
clamouring O
for O
severe O
steps O
against O
the O
Greek B-LOC
merchants O
who O
exploit O
the O
present O
moment O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
closing O
of O
the O
great O
many O
Jewish B-TER
shops I-TER
, O
to O
the O
diminished O
traffic O
in O
the O

to O
the O
scarcity O
of O

The O
lengthy O
examination O

It O
has O
been O
a O
blanket O
action O
both O
as O

as O

property B-TER
: O
even O
Jews B-TER
of O
extremely O

with O
a O
serious O
health O

been O
forced O

taken O
to O

rough O

even O
what O

They O

with O
only O
the O
oldest O
garment B-TER

the O
oldest O
shoes O
they O
had O

and O
the O
search O
for O
gold O
and O
money O
about O
the O
persons O
of O
the O
concentrated B-TER
people I-TER
has O
enabled O

almost O
empty O

Added O
to O
the O
worries O
about O
their O
entirely O
uncertain O
future O
and O
to O
the O
pain O
for O
the O
total O
loss O
of O
all O
property B-TER
, O
the O
9,000 O
people O
about O
to O
be O
deported B-TER
face O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
hardships O
that O
are O
inflicted O
on O
them O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
foresight O
or O
to O
mere O
brutality O
. O

The O
most O
basic O
sanitary O
facilities O
, O
which O
at O
first O
were O
lacking O
almost O
entirely O
, O
are O
only O
now O
beginning O
to O
work O
but O
still O
only O
inadequately O
, O
food B-TER
is O
very O
scarce O
and O
unsuitable O
( O
during O
the O
first O
days O
they O
gave O
out O
, O
even O
to O
babies O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O

some O
thin O
bean O
slops O
without O
any O

the O
guards B-TER
seize O
on O
any O
pretext O
to O
use O
with O
sadistic O

the O

they O
carry O

while O
the O
crowding O
of O
all O
sorts O
of O
people O
within O
a O
cramped O
space O
renders O
rest O
all O
but O
impossible O
. O

The O
tragic O
but O
logical O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
are O
suicides O
– O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
at O
least O
three O
so O
far O
– O
and O
, O
particularly O
among O
women O
, O
instances O
of O
hysterical O
agitation O
bordering O
on O
insanity O

According O
to O
what O
Bulgarians B-ORG
are O
saying O
, O
the O
total O
elimination O
of O
Israelite B-TER
from O
Macedonia B-LOC
has O
been O
requested O
by O
Germany B-LOC
for O
military O
reasons O
: O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
have O
made O
excellent O
, O
huge O
gains O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
that O
in O
carrying O
it O
out O
the O
have O
displayed O
the O
most O
total O
disregard O
for O
even O
the O
most O
basic O
humanitarian O
principles O
. O

I O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
claim O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
people O

having O
then O

how O

not O

very O
few O

little O

with O
no B-TER

has O
caused O
deep O
dismay O
among O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
who O
in O
their O
great O
majority O
deluded O
themselves O
that O
they O
would O
escape O
such O
a O
measure O
. O

The O
Greek B-LOC
population O
, O
in O
general O
, O
disapproves B-TER
of O
the O
severity O
with O
which O
the O
measures O
are O
carried O
out O
and O
is O
touched O
by O
what O
they O
see O
happening O
. O

Among O
the O
Jews B-TER
there O
is O
resentment B-TER
against O
the O
Greeks B-LOC

because O
a O
rumour B-TER
has O
spread O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER

acted O
at O
the O
request O
of O
a O
Greek B-LOC

is O
said O
to O

have O
to O

within O
a O
very O
short O

acts B-TER

have O
occurred O
that O
have O
left O
an O
unfavourable O
impression O

There O
have O
been O
several O
demises O
on O
the O
way O
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER

the O
railway O
station O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
Jews O
left O
their O
neighbourhood O
, O
gangs O
of O
Greek B-LOC
criminals B-TER
broke O
into O
their O
homes O
in O
order O
to O
plunder O
them O
. O

The O
Greek O
gendarmerie B-TER
had O
to O
step O
in O

resorted O
to O
firearms O

Four O
thieves O
were O
killed O

four O
more O
were O
fatally O
wounded O
, O
approx O
. O

35 O
were O
wounded O
and O
about O
a O
hundred O
were O
arrested O

German B-TER
authorities I-TER
have O
issued O
very O
harsh O
orders B-TER
whereby O
anyone O
entering O
a O
deserted O
Jewish B-TER
home O
will O
be O
shot O
on O
the O
spot O

The B-TER
rebels I-TER
have O
sent O
agents O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
to O
make O
propaganda B-TER
and O
to O
recruit O
more O
easily O
people O
for O
their O
bands O

They O
do O
this O
very O
prudently O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
being O
found O
out O

Some O
people O

indeed O
fled O

either O
to B-TER
join I-TER

” O
I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
present O
below O
some O
informative O
material O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC

an O
article O

newspaper B-TER

[ O
… O
] O
The O
most O
cursory O
reading O
of O
the O
article O
shows O
that O
it O
was O
written O
for O
the O
purpose B-TER
of I-TER
stirring I-TER
up I-TER
feeling I-TER
against O
Jews B-TER
as O
a O
class O
. O

The O
most O
definite O
charge O
is O
that O
of O
hoarding O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
were O
long O
ago O
placed O
under O
the O
most O
rigid O
restrictions B-TER
with O
regard O
to O
food B-TER
. O

Further O
, O
they O
have O
been O
so O
thoroughly O
robbed B-TER
of I-TER
all I-TER
their I-TER
possessions I-TER
, O
including O
all O
bank B-TER
accounts I-TER
, O
that O
few O
of O
them O
have O
any O
considerable O
wealth B-TER
now O
at O
their O
disposal O
. O

The O
general O
terms O
employed O
by O
the O
writer B-TER
would O
indicate O
that O
he O
is O
not O
writing O
on O
a O
factual O
basis O
but O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
an O
effect O
, O
that O
is O
, O
suspicion O
and O
hatred O
toward O
the O
Jew B-TER
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
inflammatory B-TER
article I-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
which O
has O
appeared O
in O
any O
newspaper B-TER
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

All O
evidence O
coming O
our O
[ O
sic O
] O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
indicates O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-TER
people B-TER
generally O
disapprove O
of O
the O
harsh O
measures B-TER

taken O
by O
the O
Government B-TER

do O
what O

protests B-TER
by O
many O
leading O
citizens O
and O
by O
more O
than O
forty O
members B-TER

sufficient O
evidence O
of O
the O
attitude B-TER

Concerning O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
Currently O
there O
are O
about O
50,000 O
Jews B-TER
in O
this O
country O
, O
of O
which O
about O
26,000 O
live O
in O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

Although O
they O
do O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
any O
influence O
in O
the O
cultural B-TER
sphere I-TER
, O
in O
business B-TER
( O
especially O
commerce O
) O
they O
are O
extremely O
influential O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
is O
increasingly O
the O
view O
that O
something O
must O
be O
done O
about O
this O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
, O
In O
the O
“ B-TER
Law I-TER
for I-TER
the I-TER
Protection I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
nation I-TER
, I-TER
” I-TER
promulgated O
in O
January O
1941 O
, O
the O
Government B-TER
established O
several O
articles O
concerning O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

However O
, O
the O
actual O
effect O
was O
rather O
limited O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
last O
fall O
the O
government B-TER
received O
full O
authority O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

Consequently O
, O
they O
established O
a O
new O
bureau O
and O
required O
Jews B-TER
to O
wear O
yellow B-TER
tags I-TER
, O
placed O
limitation B-TER
on O
their O
residence O
as O
well O
as O
on O
their O
activities O
besides O
business O
, O
and O
their O
control O
of O
property B-TER
2.6 O
billion O
leva O
etc O
. O

The O
government B-TER
pursued O
a O
policy B-TER
similar O
to O
that O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
such O
policies B-TER
were O
not O
very O
popular O
. O

In O
January O
this O
year O
the O
vice O
speaker O
of O
the O
Parliament O
and O
about O
forty O
members O
of O
the O
Parliament O
criticized O
the O
government O
measures O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
vice O
speaker O
. O

( O
There O
is O
rumor O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
this O
) O
. O

Recently O
many O
Jews B-TER
are O
accused O
of O
being O
involved O
in O
terror O
, O
sabotage B-TER
, O
spying O
and O
other O
forms O
of O
political O
agitation O
, O
and O
engaging O
in O
black B-TER
market I-TER
that O
should O
be O
called O
the O
cancer O
of O
Bulgarian O
economy B-TER
. O

The O
government B-TER
came O
to O
force O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
Sofia B-LOC
to O
relocate O
to O
local O
areas O
because O
it O
was O
not O
very O
successful O
to O
leave O
the O
matter O
to O
their O
own O
will O
( O
only O
2,600 O
had O
moved B-TER
out I-TER
so O
far O
) O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the O
government B-TER
will O
notify O
Jews B-TER
about O
the O
destination O
for O
their O
relocation B-TER
within O
two O
to O
three O
weeks O
. O

After O
receiving O
the O
notice O
the O
Jews B-TER
must O
leave O
the O
city O
within O
three O
days O
. O

Concerning O
this O
new O
measure O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Orthodox B-TER
Church I-TER
Stefan B-PER
and O
others O
lodged O
protest B-TER
against O
and O
it O
was O
not O
very O
popular O
in O
general O
. O

The O
Government B-TER
, O
however O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
city O
’s O
political B-TER
and I-TER
economic I-TER
condition O
will O
improve O
after O
the O
expulsion O
of O
all O
of O
its O
Jews B-TER
. O

12,000 O
Jews B-TER
who O
live O
in O
the O
new O
territories O
of O
Macedonia B-LOC
and O
Thrace B-LOC
have O
been O
deported B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

( O
Now O
the O
Jews B-TER
who O
live O
in O
these O
new O
territories O
are O
mainly O
those O
with O
foreign O
citizenship B-TER
and O
number O
no O
more O
than O
6,700 O
. O

) O
Although O
there O
was O
a O
plan O
to O
deport B-TER
the O
10,000 O
Jews B-TER
who O
live O
in O
the O
old O
territories O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
new O
measure O
this O
plan O
was O
put O
on O
hold O
. O

Through O
the O
intermediary O
of O
Switzerland B-LOC
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-LOC
Government B-TER
has O
reached O
an O
agreement O
with O
Britain B-LOC
to O
send O
5,000 O
Jews B-TER
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
they O
became O
entangled O
in O
the O
detailed O
articles O
and O
the O
agreement O
had O
not O
been O
implemented O

Nuncio B-PER
Cassulo I-PER

visit O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
apparently O
had O
a O

more O

I O
have O
heard O

that O

Monsignor O
Cassulo O
’s O
journey O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
believed O
therefore O
to O
have O
been O
a O
voyage O
of O
inspection O
in O
order O
to O
report O
to O
the O
Vatican O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

As O
to O
the O
question O
if O
the O
Nuncio O
’s O
journey O
served O
indeed O
the O
purpose O
of O
providing O
an O
exact O
picture O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
situation O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
I O
already O
reported O
on O
this O
in O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Nuncio O
was O
not O
convinced O
by O
the O
tame O
ghetto B-TER
he O
was O
shown O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
Vatican O
concerning O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
was O
joined O
by O
further O
pressure O
from O
the O
international O
Red B-TER
Cross I-TER
, O
which O
has O
friends O
and O
supporters O
among O
the O
highest O
Romanian O
circles O
. O

As O
for O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
as O
follows O
. O

When O
Romanian B-LOC
and O
German B-TER
troops B-TER
occupied B-TER
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews B-TER
at O
first O
experienced O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
– O
particularly O
in O
Odessa B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
about O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
persons O
who O
had O
not O
been O
evacuated B-TER
– O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
carried O
out O
a O
registration B-TER
and O
some O
arrests B-TER
. O

After O
the O
terrorist O
acts O
and O
particularly O
after O
the O
one O
of O
23rd O
October O
there O
were O
brutal O
reprisals O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
numbers O
, O
but O
many O
thousands O
, O
perhaps O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Jews B-TER
were O
eliminated B-TER
and O
arrested B-TER
. O

In O
was O
then O
that O
temporary O
ghettoes B-TER
and O
places O
for O
concentration B-TER
were O
created O
. O

Orders O
however O
were O
as O
yet O
unclear O
, O
and O
already O
in O
November O
many O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
were O
set O
free O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
December O
’ O
41 O
and O
in O
January O
’ O
42 O
, O
during O
the O
harshest O
of O
winters O
, O
that O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
decided O
to O
remove B-TER
the O
Jews O
from O
Odessa B-LOC
. O

I O
hardly O
need O
to O
describe O
how O
this O
emigration B-TER
took O
place O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
themselves O
admit O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
with O
greater O
humanity O
. O

Anyway O
, O
those O
who O
managed O
to O
reach O
on O
foot O
the O
places O
of O
concentration B-TER
, O
were O
banned O
to O
ghettoes B-TER
, O
that O
is O
to O
sites O
in O
the O
suburbs O
of O
small O
provincial O
towns O
. O

Considering O
the O
meteorological O
and O
political O
climate O
, O
they O
were O
treated O
with O
scant O
regard O
and O
no O
doubt O
the O
well O
- O
known O
oppressive B-TER
measures I-TER
will O
have O
continued O
there O
, O
set O
off O
by O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
, O
for O
their O
part O
, O
have O
acted O
similarly O
in O
the O
areas O
surrounding O
the O
territories O
inhabited O
by O
German B-TER
communities O
. O

This O
system O
of O
things O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
has O
been O
useful O
to O
all O
to O
rebuild O
what O
had O
been O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
losses O
and O
to O
create O
benefits O
, O
lasted O
more O
or O
less O
intensely O
, O
more O
or O
less O
arbitrarily O
until O
June O
of O
last O
year O
. O

After O
that O
the O
situation O
stabilized O
or O
, O
to O
put O
it O
more O
exactly O
, O
was O
rendered O
legal O
. O

For O
a O
start O
, O
rules B-TER
began O
to O
be O
published O
regarding O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
the O
deadline O
for O
reporting O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
also O
the O
activity O
of O
Jews B-TER
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
ghettoes B-TER
has O
been O
specified O
, O
they O
have O
been O
granted O
a O
form O
of O
self B-TER
- I-TER
government I-TER
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
if O
the O
oppressive B-TER
measures I-TER
have O
ceased O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
would O
depend O
on O
the O
local O
authorities O
and O
on O
whether O
the O
Jews B-TER
are O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
compromise O
with O
them O
. O

What O
can O
be O
said O
with O
certainty O
is O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
during O
the O
past O
months O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
not O
grown O
any O
worse O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
this O
in O
person O
. O

In O
Balta B-LOC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
approx O
. O

fifteen O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
is O
in O
a O
suburban O
part O
of O
the O
town O
and O
is O
made O
up O
of O
wretched O
cottages O
where O
a O
great O
many O
families B-TER
live O
in O
deplorable O
hygienic B-TER
conditions O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curfew B-TER
imposed O
on O
the O
ghetto B-TER
which O
starts O
at O
sundown O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
are O
not O
allowed O
into O
the O
public O
market O
, O
nor O
can O
they O
frequent O
the O
town B-TER
’s I-TER
establishments I-TER
. O

There O
is O
a O
municipal O
authority O
that O
manages O
the O
community O
and O
supplies O
the O
required O
manpower O
. O

Jews O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
in O
the O
surrounding O
areas O
. O

Those O
who O
work B-TER
receive O
one O
mark O
a O
day O
and O
a O
substantial O
bread O
ration O
. O

The O
more O
unfortunate O
Jews B-TER
, O
however O
, O
live O
or O
rather O
vegetate O
inside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
; O
the O
more O
able O
ones O
and O
particularly O
the O
young O
female O
elements O
manage O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
live O
outside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
in O
any O
case O
enjoy O
visible O
advantages O
for O
their O
lives O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
this O
situation O
in O
Balta B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Rybnitsa B-LOC
is O
more O
or O
less O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
other O
ghettoes B-TER
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
numbers O
of O
deported B-TER
or O
concentrated B-TER
Jews I-TER
change O
all O
the O
time O
. O

( O
I O
have O
myself O
seen O
in O
Balta B-LOC
about O
a O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
just O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
, O
mostly O
young O
people O
assigned O
to O
four O
months O
of O
compulsory O
work O
there O
) O
. O

In O
Bereswka O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
even O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
Prefecture O
, O
to O
posts O
of O
varying O
importance O
, O
with O
regular O
salaries O
. O

This O
denotes O
a O
marked O
improvement O
compared O
to O
last O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
in O
itself O
would O
not O
have O
any O
great O
significance O
, O
if O
some O
recent O
information O
, O
such O
as O
the O
news O
that O
has O
prompted O
the O
present O
report O
, O
did O
not O
confer O
on O
the O
situation O
an O
aspect O
that O
I O
believe O
ought O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
an O
excellent O
source O
that O
recently O
, O
at O
an O
ordinary O
conference O
of O
the O
Prefects O
of O
Transnistria B-LOC
held O
by O
the O
Governor O
in O
Rybniysa B-LOC
, O
these O
officials O
allegedly O
gave O
as O
their O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
present O
situation O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
war B-TER
remains O
uncertain O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
seemed O
advisable O
to O
improve O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
or O
to O
lessen O
the O
restrictions B-TER
on O
their O
freedom O
and O
allow O
them O
ways O
to O
resume O
a O
greater O
activity O
. O

Reportedly O
there O
was O
even O
talk O
of O
giving O
the O
Jews O
some O
compensation B-TER
for O
the O
damages O
they O
have O
suffered O
. O

Thus O
their O
situation O
would O
be O
rendered O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
and O
in O
other O
Romanian B-LOC
towns O
. O

Naturally O
this O
news B-TER
, O
which O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
discernible O
general O
trend O
towards O
improving O
the O
condition B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
has O
annoyed O
German B-TER
circles O
and O
made O
them O
mistrustful O
. O

They O
suggest O
that O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
can O
not O
be O
handled O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
any O
differently O
from O
how O
it O
has O
been O
handled O
until O
now O
. O

The O
reasons O
given O
by O
the O
Prefects O
and O
by O
those O
in O
favour O
of O
improving O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
arise O
from O
a O
pessimistic O
view O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
’s O
general O
situation O
, O
and O
that O
is O
totally O
unacceptable O
. O

They O
are O
therefore O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
entire O
matter O
is O
essentially O
decided O
by O
the O
Government B-TER
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
influenced O
by O
the O
steps O
undertaken O
by O
the O
Vatican O
and O
by O
Geneva B-TER
, O
and O
has O
easily O
taken O
root O
in O
the O
Anglophile O
and O
Francophile O
circles O
, O
whether O
military B-TER
or O
civilian O
, O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
therefore O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
Romania O
and O
of O
the O
opinion O
held O
by O
certain O
classes O
of O
Romanians B-LOC
concerning O
the O
development O
of O
that O
situation O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
am O
reporting O
all O
this O
because O
it O
is O
in O
accordance O

The O
precautions B-TER
taken O

the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Norway B-LOC

from O
the O
beginning O
, O
were O
directed O
mainly O
towards O
Full B-TER
Jews I-TER

Full O
Jews O
are O
understood O
as O
persons O
whose O
parents O
were O
both O
of O
Jewish B-TER
descent O
and O
persons O
belonging O
to O
the O
Mosaic B-TER
Faith I-TER
Society I-TER

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
all O
such O
persons O
were O
also O
subject O
to O
the O
precautions O
taken O
and O
it O
did O
not O
play O
any O
role O
, O
whether O
he O
was O
married B-TER

a O
non B-TER
- I-TER
Jew I-TER
or O
in O
a O
marriage O
to O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
with O
children O

Exceptions O
to O
this O
rule O
were O
probably O
, O
both O
so O
that O
some O
Half B-TER
- I-TER
Jews I-TER
may O
have O
been O
deported B-TER

and O
so O
that O
Full B-TER
- I-TER
Jews I-TER
who O
have O
been O
married O

Jews O
have O
been O
allowed O

Thus O
, O
in O
three O

Interned O
half O

found O
in O
Grini B-LOC

but O
these O
are O
not O
interned O
because O
of O
their O
descent O
, O
but O
because O
charges O
of O
some O
kind O
have O
been O
raised O
against O
them O
. O

Jews B-TER
who O
are O
Norwegian O
citizens O

been O
interned O
on O
the O
request B-TER

the O
Germans O

on O
the O
other O
side O

the O
Germans O

take O
place O
from O
Norway B-LOC
of O
Jews B-TER
who O
are O
Norwegian B-LOC

Furthermore O
, O
the O
German O
authorities O

The O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC

During O
the O
period O
from O
spring O
1940 O
to O
Spring O
1943 O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Germany O
were O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
deportation B-TER
began O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
in O
February O
1940 O
and O
is O
now O
largely O
completed O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
elderly O
( O
originally O
over O
65 O
, O
now O
over O
70 O
years O
) O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
in O
the O
Bohemia O
- O
Moravian O
Protectorate O
, O
whose O
former O
population O
had O
been O
evacuated B-TER
. O

The O
city O
, O
which O
originally O
had O
20 O
to O
25,000 O
inhabitants O
, O
now O
contains O
approx O
. O

50,000 O
Jews B-TER
. O

However O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
population O
consists O
only O
of O
the O
Old O
people O
, O
the O
passing O
is O
still O
very O
large O
. O

Young O
Jews B-TER
have O
been O
deployed O
to O
work B-TER
in O
various O
locations O
in O
the O
eastern O
areas O
. O

The O
deportation O
has O
been O
practiced O
somewhat O
differently O
in O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
exceptions O
that O
apply O
to O
certain O
areas O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
under O
the O
legislation O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Jews B-TER
married O
to O
Aryans B-TER
, O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
observed O
during O
the O
Deportations O
. O

The O
Jewish O
spouse O
in O
such O
a O
marriage B-TER
is O
usually O
spared O
only O
when O
he O
or O
she O
lives O
with O
the O
Aryan B-TER
partner I-TER
or O
with O
any O
common B-TER
Children I-TER
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
children O
are O
minors O
or O
adults O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
several O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
men O
married O
to O
Aryan B-TER
women O
have O
been O
deported O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
no O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
women O
married O
to O
Aryan B-TER
men O
were O
deported O
. O

There O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish O
spouse O
has O
been O
deported O
after O
the O
couple B-TER
's I-TER
only O
son O
has O
fallen B-TER
in O
the O
war O
, O
which O
otherwise O
in B-TER
Jewish I-TER
laws I-TER
justifies O
a O
privileged O
position O
. O

This O
is O
motivated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exception B-TER
from I-TER
deportation I-TER
can O
only O
be O
justified O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
the O
spouse O
or O
children O
, O
and O
that O
this O
consideration O
no O
longer O
applies O
when O
the O
child O
does O
not O
live O
at O
home O
, O
cf O
. O

above O
, O
or O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
. O

Although O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O
principle O
applies O
only O
to O
Jews B-TER
, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
special O
provisions O
in O
the O
Practice B-TER
of I-TER
Mischlinge I-TER
( O
Half B-TER
and I-TER
Quarter I-TER
Jews I-TER
) O
that O
they O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
special O
class O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
all O
areas O
where O
the O
Administration O
’s O
decisions O
are O
decisive O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
attitude I-TER
must O
be O
considered O
. O

Within O
leading O
circles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
movements O
, O
one O
that O
wants O
to O
restrict O
the O
Jewish B-TER
laws I-TER
to O
the O
real O
Jews B-TER
, O
and O
one O
more O
radical O
that O
wants O
to O
liberate B-TER
Germany O
from O
both O
Jews B-TER
and O
Bastards O
. O

Which O
movement O
ultimately O
prevails O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
, O
but O
the O
radical O
direction O
in O
recent O
times O
seems O
to O
assert O
itself O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
provision O
introduced O
in O
1942 O
, O
whereby O
half B-TER
Jews I-TER
are O
excluded B-TER
from O
the O
army O
, O
could O
be O
fatal O
. O

One O
has O
to O
consider O
, O
that O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
citizenship B-TER
links O
to O
the O
right O
to O
exercise O
civil B-TER
rights I-TER
such O
as O
military B-TER
service I-TER
and O
labor O
service O
. O

Therefore O
Mischlinge B-TER
, O
who O
fail O
to O
serve O
, O
are O
prevented B-TER
from I-TER
enjoying I-TER
civil I-TER
rights I-TER
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
in O
the O
Legislature B-TER
of O
Quarter B-TER
Jews I-TER
marrying O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
the O
Standesämter O
refuse O
to O
marry O
such O
persons O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
special O
permit O
. O

The O
limited O
access O
of O
the O
Mischlinge B-TER
to O
- O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Half B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
total O
exclusion O
from O
- O
the O
higher B-TER
education I-TER
( O
including O
vocational O
schools O
) O
may O
in O
the O
future O
have O
the O
most O
fateful O
consequences O
, O
with O
Half B-TER
Jews I-TER
subsequently O
missing O
the O
prerequisite O
for O
becoming O
anything O
but O
unskilled O
workers B-TER
. O

Mischlinge B-TER
are O
excluded O
from O
owning O
an O
inheritance B-TER
farm I-TER
, O
requiring O
Aryan B-TER
descent I-TER
since I-TER
1800 I-TER
. O

With O
regard O
to O
other O
land O
estates O
, O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
, O
but O
in O
practice O
, O
Mischlinge B-TER
will O
generally O
be O
forced B-TER
out I-TER
of O
possession O
of O
such O
property O
, O
the O
same O
applies O
to O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
of O
Jews B-TER
. O

Mischlinge B-TER
and I-TER
non I-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
spouses I-TER
have O
free O
access O
to O
private O
businesses O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
in O
Practice O
they O
will O
often O
be O
pushed B-TER
out I-TER
of O
Companies B-TER
of O
any O
significance O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
armour B-TER
industry I-TER
– O
companies O
owned O
them O
or O
within O
which O
they O
play O
a O
large O
role O
will O
be O
excluded O
from O
public O
order O
. O

There O
are O
still O
rumours B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
of O
further O
measures B-TER
taken I-TER
against I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
e.g. O
, O
it O
states O
that O
a O
law B-TER
must O
be O
drawn O
up O
, O
requiring O
Aryans B-TER
who O
are O
married O
to O
Jews B-TER
to O
divorce O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O
its O
full O
extent O
could O
be O
put O
into O
effect O
also O
for O
the O
group O
of O
Jews B-TER
who O
have O
hitherto O
been O
allowed O
to O
stay O
because O
they O
were O
married O
to O
Aryans B-TER
. O

Furthermore O
, O
rumours B-TER
have O
been O
spread O
regarding O
certain O
measures O
against O
half B-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

In O
particular O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
Mischlinge B-TER
in O
cities O
, O
where O
the O
housing O
demand O
is O
high O
due O
to O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
airstrikes B-TER
, O
should O
be O
evicted O
from O
their O
apartments B-TER
. O

Whether O
this O
will O
happen O
is O
impossible O
to O
predict O
. O

However O
, O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
it O
has O
been O
noted O
that O
the O
Campaign B-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
Press B-TER
has O
now O
been O
intensified O
again O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
lately O
, O
Mischlinge B-TER
has O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
Bastards O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Mischling B-TER
problem I-TER
is O
to O
a O
significant O
degree O
an O
upper O
- O
class O
problem O
; O
since O
the O
mixed B-TER
marriages I-TER
have O
mainly O
taken O
place O
within O
the O
bourgeoisie O
, O
there O
could O
also O
be O
an O
unfortunate O
impact O
on O
the O
position O

the O

a O
day O
and O
half O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
later O
only O
one O
quarter O
of O
a O
loaf B-TER
. I-TER

Very O
few O
people B-TER
survived O
the O
hard O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
they O
took O
me O
with O
a O
transport B-TER
to O
Magdeburg B-LOC
. O

There O
I O
worked B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
in O
an O
ammunition B-TER
factory I-TER
. O

I O
worked B-TER
one O
day O
at O
daytime O
, O
on O
the O
other O
day O
at O
night O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
not O
hard O
, O
only O
the O
workday O
was O
very O
long O
and O
the O
night O
shift O
was O
especially O
difficult O
to O
endure O
. O

They O
did O
not O
harm O
us O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
civilian O
overseers B-TER
sometimes O
gave O
extra O
food B-TER
to O
a O
woman B-TER
. O

However O
, O
I O
had O
already O
been O
so O
weakened O
by O
then O
that O
sometimes O
I O
could O
hardly O
walk O
. O

That O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
prior O
events O
and O
the O
overwork O
. O

When O
the O
American B-TER
were O
coming O
closer O
to O
Magdeburg B-LOC
, O
soldiers B-TER
from O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
took O
us O
to O
a O
village O
called O
Nedlitz B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
everything O
there O
and O
we O
had O
to O
march O
very O
fast O
. O

They O
put O
down O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
on O
a O
square O
. O

Later O
we O
learned O
that O
square O
was O
an O
airport O
and O
there O
was O
an O
air O
raid O
that O
night O
, O
on O
account O
of O
which O
about O
4,000 O
people B-TER
died B-TER
. I-TER

The O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
soldiers O
had O
escaped O
from O
us O
before O
the O
air O
raid O
and O
those O
who O
survived O
met O
the O
American B-TER
troops O
already O
on O
the O
next O
day O
. O

One O
of O
my O
most O
terrible O
experiences O
was O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

A O
woman B-TER
of O
about O
50 O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
her O
daughter B-TER
at O
the O
selection B-TER
. O

Then O
an O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
began O
to O
hit O
her O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
was O
already O
quite O
beside O
herself O
and O
she O
hit O
the O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
back O
. O

Then O
the O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
took O
a O
dog O
whip O
and O
looped O
it O
around O
the O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
neck O
and O
she O
dragged O
her O
like O
that O
along O
the O
whole O
long O
way O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
screaming O
was O
horrible O
and O
unforgettable O
. O

When O
she O
was O
barely O
alive O
, O
two O
other O
SS B-TER
soldiers O
shot O
at O
her O
. O

The O
corpse B-TER
was O
left O
before O
us O
all O
the O
time O
, O
so O
that O
we O
learn O
from O
the O
case O
, O
because O
that O
is O
what O
happens O
to O
those O
who O
contradict O
them O
. O

The O
suffering O
of O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
mine O
, O
a O
young O
girl B-TER
, O
was O
also O
terrible O
; O
they O
took O
her O
insulin O
away O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
so O
she O
died B-TER
there O
, O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
My O
father B-TER
was O
a O
grocer O
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

He O
had O
two O
houses O
, O
the O
third O
one O
had O
just O
started O
to O
be O
built O
then O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
a O
five O
- O
room O
flat O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
my O
two O
siblings O
; O
my O
father O
was O
definitely O
considered O
a O
rich O
man O
. O

He O
buried O
somewhere O
a O
lot O
of O
money B-TER
, O
jewellery O
and O
receipts O
written O
by O
his O
Christian O
friends O
stating O
what O
and O
how O
much O
they O
had O
accepted O
from O
him O
for O
safekeeping O
. O

He O
, O
the O
poor O
man O
, O
died B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
at O
home O
as O
yet O
and O
I O
do O
not O
know O
where O
he O
buried O
those O
valuables O
, O
so O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
I O
can O
ever O
get O
hold O
of O
them O
. O

My O
father O
was O
, O
on O
account O
of O
his O
decorations O
earned O
in O
the O
other O
war O
, O
exempt O
from O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
together O
with O
his O
whole O
family O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wear O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
and O
when O
all O
the O
other O
Jews O
from O
Kassa B-LOC
were O
sent O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
told O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
go O
there O
. O

Yet O
, O
this O
was O
the O
time O
when O
my O
father O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
safe O
place O
for O
his O
valuables O
. O

Although O
, O
some O
days O
later O
a O
gendarme B-TER
appeared O
and O
said O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
. O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
another O
one O
came O
and O
said O
we O
could O
stay O
. O

It O
went O
on O
like O
that O
for O
days O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
continuous O
anxiety O
; O
finally O
one O
day O
they O
took B-TER
us I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
ghetto I-TER
nevertheless O
. O

We O
had O
to O
get O
ready O
within O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
we O
could O
take O
with O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
. O

I O
could O
have O
escaped O
but O
my O
parents O
insisted O
on O
our O
staying O
together O
. O

If O
they O
had O
suspected O
that O
our O
being O
together O
would O
last O
for O
such O
a O
short O
time O
, O
they O
might O
have O
let O
me O
escape B-TER
. O

They O
crammed O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
brickyard O
of O
Kassa B-LOC
, O
plenty O
of O
people O
in O
a O
very O
small O
place O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

We O
lived O
mostly O
on O
what O
we O
had O
brought O
with O
us O
. O

Chief O
inspector O
Dr O
Csatári B-PER
was O
continuously O
beating O
people B-TER
with O
a O
dog O
whip O
. O

When O
it O
came O
to O
his O
mind O
, O
he O
went O
in O
the O
block O
and O
he O
hit B-TER
whomever O
he O
found O
there O
with O
the O
dog O
whip O
. O

On O
one O
occasion O
he O
ordered O
through O
a O
microphone O
every O
young O
girl B-TER
to O
come O
out O
. O

He O
took O
them O
out O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
dig O
out O
thick O
wooden O
stakes O
from O
the O
ground O
with O
their O
hands O
. O

Even O
the O
SS B-TER
soldiers I-TER
were O
scandalized O
by O
this O
; O
they O
said O
that O
for O
them O
, O
such O
things O
are O
done O
with O
spades O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
brickyard O
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
we O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
do O
agricultural O
work B-TER
but O
we O
would O
stay O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. I-LOC

We O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
believe O
this O
, O
but O
we O
found O
it O
suspicious O
that O
German B-TER
soldiers I-TER
were O
there O
with O
us O
. O

One O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
they O
woke O
us O
up O
at O
4 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Policemen B-TER
occupied O
the O
brickyard O
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
gather O
at O
a O
large O
place O
and O
stand O
there O
in O
the O
blazing O
sun O
till O
3 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

They O
did O
not O
let O
us O
eat B-TER
or O
go O
for O
water O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
escaped B-TER
even O
from O
there O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
pillow O
and O
a O
duvet O
with O
us O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

72 O
people B-TER
were O
in O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
together O
with O
plenty O
of O
bedclothes O
and O
packages O
of O
food B-TER
. O

It O
was O
terribly O
hot O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
and O
we O
were O
horribly O
thirsty O
. O

After O
a O
three O
- O
day O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
21st O
May O
. O

We O
had O
to O
jump O
out O
of O
the O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
we O
were O
told O
to O
leave O
our O
baggage O
there O
, O
they O
would O
be O
sent O
after O
us O
. O

They O
lined B-TER
us I-TER
up I-TER
and O
by O
the O
time O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
what O
was O
happening O
I O
had O
been O
in O
a O
group O
with O
one O
of O
my O
younger O
brothers O
but O
without O
my O
father O
. O

We O
who O
were O
able O
to O
work B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
the O
bath O
; O
they O
stripped O
us O
naked O
and O
bathed O
us O
, O
then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
block O
No O
. O

13 O
. O

5 O
people B-TER
had O
to O
find O
space O
on O
one O
berth O
. O

We O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
and O
then O
the O
overseer B-TER
came O
in O
and O
struck O
us O
with O
a O
truncheon O
. O

That O
was O
the O
first O
beating O
. O

We O
lined O
up O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
Appell O
and O
if O
somebody O
was O
not O
standing O
as O
upright O
as O
a O
ramrod O
, O
they O
struck O
him O
. O

Those O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
toilet O
were O
also O
beaten B-TER
up I-TER
. O

Three O
days O
later O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Wolfsberg B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
put O
in O
tents B-TER
made O
of O
cardboard O
, O
3 O
metres O
in O
diameter O
, O
20 O
people B-TER
in O
each O
. O

We O
did O
a O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
there O
, O
first O
at O
road O
construction O
, O
then O
chiselled O
concrete O
in O
a O
tunnel O
. O

Our O
provisions O
consisted O
of O
1/3 O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
some O
black O
coffee B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
and O
some O
soup B-TER
without O
any O
content O
. O

We O
starved B-TER
terribly O
and O
became O
very O
weak O
. O

If O
they O
saw O
somebody O
getting O
hold O
of O
a O
raw O
potato B-TER
, O
he O
received O
25 O
strikes O
on O
his O
soles O
and O
they O
took O
the O
potato B-TER
away O
. O

One O
of O
their O
favourite O
punishments O
was O
that O
when O
we O
came O
back O
from O
work B-TER
and O
were O
tired O
, O
they O
made O
us O
do O
somersaults O
, O
or O
we O
had O
to O
be O
crouching O
or O
jumping O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
. O

They O
called O
it O
doing O
sports O
. O

After O
12 O
hours O
of O
hard O
work B-TER
and O
being O
provisioned O
like O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
survive O
. O

10 O
- O
12 O
people B-TER
died B-TER
every O
day O
. O

My O
leg O
developed O
a O
tumour B-TER
and O
I O
had O
already O
been O
very O
weak O
then O
, O
so O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
hospital B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
four O
months O
in O
hospital B-TER
and O
my O
leg O
was O
operated O
on O
but O
I O
could O
not O
regain O
my O
strength O
after O
that O
. O

It O
happened O
sometimes O
that O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
did O
not O
give O
the O
patients O
food B-TER
for O
a O
day O
. O

I O
was O
discharged O
from O
hospital B-TER
on O
15th O
January O
and O
they O
took O
me O
to O
Wüstegiesdorf B-LOC
. O

800 O
people B-TER
lived O
there O
in O
a O
big O
building B-TER
. O

I O
was O
very O
glad O
, O
because O
that O
camp B-TER
was O
clean O
and O
washing O
in O
hot O
water O
was O
a O
daily O
obligation O
. O

The O
provisions O
were O
better O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
we O
could O
go O
to O
the O
city O
and O
there O
we O
could O
acquire O
some O
food B-TER
. O

I O
was O
a O
gatekeeper O
and O
for O
this O
I O
received O
double O
rations B-TER
. O

Much O
to O
my O
delight O
I O
met O
one O
of O
my O
uncles O
there O
, O
who O
worked O
at O
the O
kitchen O
and O
always O
gave O
me O
a O
little O
food B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
approaching O
, O
two O
of O
our O
comrades O
escaped B-TER
. O

We O
were O
packed O
up O
and O
we O
marched B-TER
70 O
kilometres O
within O
2 O
days O
in O
terrible O
cold O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Qualisch B-LOC
on O
a O
Monday O
, O
but O
we O
were O
given O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
only O
on O
Friday O
. O

We O
suffered O
terribly O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

What O
the O
peasants O
threw O
away O
, O
like O
rotten O
potatoes B-TER
or O
turnips B-TER
, O
we O
picked O
up O
from O
the O
rubbish O
pile O
and O
ate O
them O
. O

We O
already O
looked O
so O
bad O
that O
we O
did O
not O
even O
like O
to O
look O
at O
each O
other O
. O

Finally O
they O
put O
us O
in O
open O
freight O
cars O
, O
60 O
people B-TER
in O
each O
. O

We O
were O
travelling O
for O
six O
days O
; O
it O
was O
snowing O
and O
we O
were O
suffering O
terribly O
from O
cold O
too O
. O

6 O
people O
died B-TER
in O
my O
freight O
car O
during O
that O
journey O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
went O
mad O
. O

800 O
people B-TER
started O
from O
Wüstegiesdorf B-LOC
and O
500 O
of O
us O
arrived O
in O
Hildesheim B-LOC
. O

And O
from O
those O
only O
400 O
were O
able O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
rebuild O
a O
train O
station O
destroyed O
by O
bombs B-TER
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
to O
carry O
rails O
and O
sleepers O
when O
we O
had O
already O
been O
almost O
unable O
to O
drag O
ourselves O
along O
. O

The O
provisions O
were O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
every O
day O
. O

We O
received O
1/6 O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
soup B-TER
once O
a O
day O
, O
but O
it O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
bread B-TER
was O
omitted O
. O

The O
following O
case O
made O
a O
terrible O
impression O
on O
me O
: O
a O
freight O
car O
containing O
food B-TER
destroyed O
by O
a O
bomb B-TER
was O
standing O
on O
the O
train O
station O
. O

Those O
who O
could O
tried O
to O
get O
some O
food B-TER
from O
it O
. O

One O
of O
the O
Scharführers B-TER
saw O
when O
a O
boy B-TER
of O
14 O
hid O
a O
tin O
of O
food B-TER
under O
his O
jacket O
. O

He O
ordered O
the O
boy B-TER
to O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
pressed O
his O
gun O
to O
his O
temple O
. O

The O
child B-TER
began O
to O
beg O
, O
so O
he O
removed O
the O
revolver O
from O
there O
but O
he O
put O
it O
back O
in O
a O
minute O
. O

This O
game O
repeated O
again O
and O
again O
and O
it O
was O
awful O
to O
hear O
the O
fear O
of O
death B-TER
in O
the O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
voice O
, O
he O
was O
practically O
howling O
and O
whimpering O
of O
fear O
. O

When O
the O
German B-TER
soldier I-TER
became O
bored O
with O
this O
amusement O
, O
he O
grabbed O
both O
hands O
of O
the O
child B-TER
and O
shot B-TER
him I-TER
in O
the O
head O
. O

There O
was O
another O
case O
when O
a O
prisoner B-TER
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
but O
he O
was O
caught O
. O

The O
whole O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
appear O
at O
the O
hanging B-TER
and O
the O
boy B-TER
's O
father B-TER
was O
placed O
in O
the O
first O
row O
, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
gallows O
; O
he O
had O
to O
watch O
his O
son B-TER
’s I-TER
death B-TER
till O
the O
end O
. O

In O
Belsen B-LOC
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
got O
typhus B-TER
. I-TER

We O
had O
to O
carry O
or O
pull O
the O
corpses B-TER
in O
our O
arms O
to O
the O
place O
of O
collection O
. O

In O
Hannover B-LOC
, O
we O
worked B-TER
all O
the O
time O
at O
night O
in O
a O
tunnel O
; O
they O
said O
they O
were O
building O
an O
underground O
airplane O
factory O
. O

They O
beat O
us O
awfully O
there O
. O

Hits O
were O
raining O
upon O
us O
practically O
every O
minute O
. O

People B-TER
were O
falling O
down O
like O
flies O
in O
the O
autumn O
. O

We O
received O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
every O
other O
day O
. O

We O
were O
suffering O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

It O
happened O
there O
that O
one O
wretch O
cut O
some O
flesh O
out O
of O
the O
thigh O
of O
a O
dead B-TER
man I-TER
and O
he O
also O
took O
his O
lungs O
out O
. O

The O
dead B-TER
man I-TER
’s I-TER
fellows O
saw O
that O
and O
they O
took O
the O
man O
to O
the O
back O
and O
they O
beat O
him O
until O
he O
collapsed O
full O
of O
blood O
. O

When O
he O
recovered O
consciousness O
, O
they O
began O
to O
beat O
him O
again O
until O
he O
died B-TER
. O

I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
horrible O
episode O
. O

An O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
shot O
dead B-TER
a O
physician B-TER
called O
Schönstein B-PER
, O
because O
he O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
pick O
some O
carrots B-TER
. O

When O
the O
English O
came B-TER
in I-TER
, O
they O
only O
found O
skeletons O
in O
our O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
belonged O
already O
to O
the O
dead B-TER
, O
rather O
than O
living O
people O
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Approximately O
4000 O
Jews O
lived O
in O
Nagyszöllős B-LOC
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
craftsmen O
and O
tradesmen O
, O
but O
there O
were O
doctors B-TER
and O
a O
lawyer B-TER
and O
an O
engineer O
too O
. O

They O
were O
not O
rich O
, O
but O
everybody O
lived O
decently O
. O

I O
lived O
with O
my O
mother O
and O
one O
of O
my O
sisters O
under O
modest O
financial O
circumstances O
. O

The O
first O
antisemitic B-TER
measures I-TER
were O
issued O
in O
March B-TER
1939 I-TER
. O

My O
mother O
owned O
a O
tobacconist O
’s O
shop O
, O
which O
was O
seized B-TER
immediately O
. O

The O
shops O
were O
confiscated B-TER
from O
other O
people O
as O
well O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
on O
our O
living O
was O
getting O
worse O
. O

Chief B-TER
notary I-TER
János B-PER
Kristofori I-PER
issued O
these O
decrees O
and O
György B-PER
Koflonovits I-PER
harassed O
the O
Jews O
, O
including O
me O
. O

He O
forced O
my O
boss O
to O
fire O
me O
, O
so O
I O
was O
laid O
off O
. O

The O
Jews O
could O
not O
protect O
themselves O
, O
because O
there O
was O
nobody O
we O
could O
turn O
to O
for O
help O
. O

Sunday O
morning O
, O
on O
April O
23 O
, O
1944 O
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
. O

This O
situation O
lasted O
for O
a O
week O
, O
during O
which O
they O
were O
constantly O
searching O
for O
money O
and O
valuables O
. O

After O
that O
we O
went O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
only O
with O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
underwear B-TER
and O
one O
set O
of O
clothes B-TER
. O

Before O
locking O
the O
ghetto B-TER
up O
, O
the O
military B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
and O
the O
leventes O
ordered O
us O
once O
more O
to O
hand O
over O
our O
jewellery O
and O
money O
, O
because O
- O
as O
they O
said O
- O
we O
would O
not O
need O
them O
any O
more O
as O
we O
would O
be O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
local O
Gentile O
residents O
were O
watching O
our O
misery O
and O
laughing O
at O
us O
, O
which O
I O
could O
never O
forget O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fence O
. O

Some O
flats O
had O
10 O
families O
living B-TER
in O
them O
and O
therefore O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
terribly O
crowded O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
cared O
about O
nothing O
. O

Once O
I O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
some O
food B-TER
for O
my O
mother B-TER
, O
but O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
captured O
and O
beat O
me O
up O
seriously O
. O

After O
six O
days O
we O
set O
off O
. O

By O
this O
time O
many O
Jews O
had O
already O
died B-TER
or O
committed O
suicide B-TER
. O

We O
were O
not O
given O
food B-TER
at O
all O
and O
we O
were O
driven O
like O
animals O
, O
pushed O
and O
thrown O
into O
the O
freight O
cars O
. O

There O
were O
80 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
car O
being O
responsible O
for O
everybody O
. O

Escaping B-TER
from O
the O
freight O
car O
would O
have O
been O
possible O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
mother O
. O

We O
travelled O
for O
ten O
days O
and O
during O
that O
time O
we O
were O
given O
water O
only O
three O
times O
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
escorted O
us O
until O
we O
reached O
Kassa B-LOC
where O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
us O
over O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
that O
they O
expected O
us O
to O
know O
where O
we O
were O
going O
and O
warned O
us O
that O
we O
would O
be O
given O
food B-TER
and O
payment O
based O
on O
our O
work O
performance O
. O

I O
was O
warned O
particularly O
. O

At O
some O
level O
we O
believed O
what O
we O
were O
told O
, O
because O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
what O
happened O
afterwards O
. O

After O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
the O
Poles B-TER
threw O
the O
children B-TER
and O
elderly B-TER
people I-TER
out O
of O
the O
freight O
cars O
, O
and O
I O
could O
hardly O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
mother O
and O
my O
sister O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
crying O
and O
moaning O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
would O
allow O
the O
families O
to O
stay O
together O
, O
we O
were O
separated O
. O

I O
have O
not O
seen O
my O
mother O
since O
then O
. O

Soon O
they O
started O
the O
selection B-TER
, O
during O
which O
they O
separated B-TER
the O
ill B-TER
from O
those O
who O
were O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
. O

We O
were O
taken O
into O
a O
washroom O
where O
they O
shaved O
our O
heads O
, O
disinfected O
us O
and O
gave O
us O
striped O
prisoner B-TER
’s O
clothes B-TER
. O

Still O
wet O
, O
with O
nothing O
but O
a O
dress O
on O
we O
were O
taken O
into O
a O
block B-TER
. O

There O
we O
were O
lying O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
board O
and O
because O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
we O
could O
not O
fall O
asleep O
despite O
our O
exhaustion O
. O

We O
were O
in O
this O
block B-TER
for O
three O
days O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
arrived O
we O
were O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
that O
lasted O
from O
morning O
to O
night O
. O

We O
were O
not O
given O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
at O
all O
for O
four O
days O
. O

People B-TER
were O
starving B-TER
and O
felt O
dizzy O
. O

We O
drank O
water O
like O
animals O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
we O
got O
soup B-TER
and O
200 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
were O
there O
for O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
were O
constantly O
beaten O
. O

Selections B-TER
were O
performed O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Dr O
Mengele B-PER
came O
by O
taxi O
and O
started O
the O
selection B-TER
. O

He O
beckoned O
to O
himself O
those O
whom O
he O
disliked O
, O
and O
sent O
back O
those O
whom O
he O
needed O
. O

It O
happened O
to O
me O
once O
that O
the O
SS B-TER
soldier I-TER
standing O
next O
to O
him O
misunderstood O
his O
wave O
, O
grabbed O
my O
arm O
and O
took O
me O
away O
instead O
of O
my O
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
. O

But O
I O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
through O
the O
window O
. O

Considering O
that O
during O
selections B-TER
we O
were O
naked O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
, O
but O
somehow O
I O
got O
clothes B-TER
and O
I O
escaped B-TER
into O
an O
unfamiliar O
block O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
block O
9 O
, O
where O
the O
entire O
block O
had O
been O
emptied O
, O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
people B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
they O
had O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
900 O
people B-TER
. O

There O
was O
a O
block O
curfew B-TER
, O
when O
everyone O
went O
into O
his O
or O
her O
own O
block O
. O

Three O
dumper O
trucks O
with O
trailers O
entered O
and O
they O
started O
to O
throw O
us O
onto O
the O
carts O
irrespective O
of O
whether O
we O
were O
ill B-TER
, O
young B-TER
, O
strong O
or O
weak O
. O

I O
was O
in O
that O
group O
and O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
escape B-TER
was O
that O
I O
told O
them O
I O
was O
there O
to O
help O
them O
loading O
. O

I O
got O
in O
the O
truck O
, O
sat O
next O
to O
the O
driver O
and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

After O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
, O
we O
practically O
turned O
people B-TER
out O
from O
the O
car O
; O
if O
someone O
was O
not O
able O
to O
stand O
up O
, O
we O
threw O
him O
in O
. O

We O
undressed O
everybody O
, O
but O
as O
a O
beginner O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
the O
horrible O
things O
that O
came O
next O
. O

We O
unloaded O
the O
prisoners B-TER
and O
I O
had O
to O
watch O
as O
my O
friends O
, O
acquaintances O
and O
relatives O
were O
taken O
away O
, O
undressed O
and O
given O
soaps O
and O
towels O
. O

Finally O
we O
herded O
all O
the O
2000 O
people B-TER
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

They O
went O
in O
unsuspectingly O
and O
we O
locked O
every O
window O
from O
outside O
. O

They O
were O
expecting O
water O
running O
from O
the O
shower O
and O
then O
the O
gas B-TER
operator O
turned O
on O
the O
gas B-TER
. O

They O
were O
moaning O
and O
yelling O
as O
the O
gas B-TER
was O
torturing O
them O
. O

Mothers B-TER
had O
to O
see O
their O
children B-TER
die B-TER
. O

The O
strongest O
man B-TER
was O
able O
to O
bear O
it O
for O
six O
minutes O
. O

After O
six O
minutes O
we O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
we O
faced O
a O
heap O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies O
. O

Then O
we O
started O
to O
throw O
the O
bodies B-TER
onto O
trams O
, O
as O
if O
we O
would O
shovel O
coal O
, O
and O
then O
took O
and O
put O
them O
into O
the O
ovens B-TER
. O

The O
burning B-TER
process O
took O
place O
there O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
with O
that O
work B-TER
unit I-TER
for O
three O
days O
, O
but O
this O
horrible O
work B-TER
was O
bordering O
on O
madness O
and O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
it O
anymore O
. O

I O
told O
the O
Kommandoführer B-TER
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
leave O
and O
he O
sent O
me O
to O
another O
crematorium B-TER
, O
because O
there O
were O
five O
of O
them O
. O

My O
work B-TER
was O
easier O
there O
, O
as O
my O
task O
was O
to O
drive O
, O
beat O
and O
chase O
people B-TER
. O

It O
happened O
that O
an O
entire O
transport B-TER
from O
Hungary B-LOC
had O
to O
be O
burnt B-TER
upon O
their O
arrival O
without O
any O
selection B-TER
. I-TER

Neither O
the O
young B-TER
nor O
the O
old O
could O
escape B-TER
. O

Our O
equipments O
were O
more O
modern O
. O

Two O
thousand O
people B-TER
were O
herded O
into O
a O
large O
hall O
, O
of O
course O
undressed O
, O
with O
soaps O
and O
towels O
. O

Then O
gas B-TER
came O
out O
of O
the O
nozzles O
. O

After O
the O
gas B-TER
killed B-TER
the O
people B-TER
, O
the O
automatic O
floor O
started O
to O
move O
and O
it O
threw O
the O
bodies B-TER
into O
the O
oven B-TER
underneath O
. O

That O
was O
a O
circle O
- O
shaped O
floor O
, O
which O
could O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
mechanically O
. O

When O
all O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
oven B-TER
, O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
arrived O
and O
it O
started O
all O
over O
again O
. O

The O
victims B-TER
were O
unsuspicious O
and O
thought O
that O
the O
others O
before O
them O
left O
the O
room O
through O
another O
door O
. O

The O
procedure O
continued O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
there O
for O
six O
days O
and O
then O
one O
of O
my O
acquaintances O
sent O
me O
into O
an O
infirmary B-TER
. O

People B-TER
working B-TER
there O
were O
generally O
not O
kept O
for O
more O
than O
24 O
hours O
, O
because O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

We O
lived O
quite O
separated O
, O
and O
I O
managed O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
another O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
block O
19 O
where O
1200 O
of O
us O
stayed O
for O
about O
five O
to O
six O
days O
. O

Our O
food B-TER
was O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
soup B-TER
. O

From O
there O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

I O
received O
my O
first O
prisoner B-TER
number O
there O
and O
I O
was O
taken O
into O
a O
block O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
we O
cleared O
rubble O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in I-LOC
Warsaw I-LOC
. O

We O
demolished O
the O
remaining O
walls O
, O
cleaned O
the O
bricks O
. O

What O
we O
produced O
was O
sent O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
. I-LOC

I O
worked B-TER
together O
with O
young O
men B-TER
from O
Nagyszőllős B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
looking O
for O
a O
barber O
and O
since O
I O
knew O
how O
to O
shave O
, O
I O
was O
picked O
. O

I O
immediately O
shaved O
one O
of O
them O
. O

That O
was O
a O
very O
good O
position O
and O
my O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
better O
as O
well O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
was O
given O
marmalade B-TER
or O
margarine B-TER
. O

Thus O
I O
could O
help O
the O
other O
men B-TER
from O
my O
hometown O
. O

Life O
went O
on O
like O
this O
for O
three O
months O
. O

After O
that O
there O
was O
a O
terrible O
retreat O
. O

About O
5000 O
people B-TER
were O
driven B-TER
on I-TER
foot I-TER
towards O
a O
destination O
130 O
kilometres O
away O
. O

We O
marched B-TER
30 O
kilometres O
a O
day O
in O
heavy O
rain O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
journey O
we O
received O
only O
one O
third O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Each O
of O
us O
had O
to O
carry O
three O
blankets O
. O

We O
had O
to O
sleep O
on O
those O
wet O
, O
completely O
soaked B-TER
blankets I-TER
under O
the O
open O
sky O
, O
in O
pouring O
rain O
. O

We O
were O
entrained O
at O
a O
place O
130 O
kilometres O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
beat O
and O
chase O
us O
again O
. O

Later O
we O
suffered O
from O
the O
terribly O
hot O
weather O
and O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
water O
for O
four O
days O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
we O
reached O
a O
river O
. O

When O
people B-TER
saw O
the O
water O
, O
they O
got O
completely O
wild O
, O
ran O
into O
the O
water O
and O
drank O
that O
filthy O
and O
dirty O
water O
full O
of O
seaweed O
like O
crazy O
. O

We O
did O
not O
want O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
so O
the O
SS B-TER
began O
to O
drive O
us O
out O
, O
naturally O
, O
by O
shooting O
at O
us O
. O

Among O
many O
others O
, O
my O
friend O
standing O
next O
to O
me O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

When O
the O
SS B-TER
noticed O
that O
his O
blood O
formed O
a O
stripe O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
they O
kept O
trampling O
him O
down O
until O
he O
drowned B-TER
. O

We O
already O
had O
been O
so O
apathetic O
that O
things O
like O
that O
had O
only O
a O
little O
effect O
on O
us O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
reached O
the O
freight O
cars O
, O
we O
had O
been O
totally O
exhausted O
. O

For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
my O
townsmen O
died B-TER
of O
thirst O
in O
the O
lap O
of O
his O
son B-TER
. O

He O
was O
moaning O
and O
begging O
for O
water O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
help O
him O
. O

That O
man B-TER
even O
tore O
his O
gold O
teeth O
out O
of O
his O
own O
mouth O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
guards O
, O
but O
despite O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
. O

The O
capos B-TER
were O
our O
murderers B-TER
and O
hurried O
our O
death B-TER
. O

They O
beat O
and O
killed B-TER
people O
with O
stakes O
. O

After O
travelling O
for O
six O
days O
without O
food B-TER
and O
water O
we O
arrived O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
got O
off O
the O
freight O
car O
, O
14 O
out O
of O
60 O
people B-TER
had O
already O
been O
dead B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
behind O
everything O
we O
had O
, O
even O
our O
blankets O
. O

Being O
hardly O
able O
to O
walk O
, O
we O
were O
carried O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
stretchers O
, O
and O
as O
usual O
, O
we O
were O
disinfected O
. O

There O
we O
were O
given O
black O
coffee B-TER
and O
a O
little O
bread B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
for O
14 O
days O
and O
then O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
receive O
us O
there O
. O

After O
staying O
there O
for O
two O
days O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

The O
situation O
there O
was O
similar O
as O
in O
the O
other O
camps B-TER
. O

We O
were O
assigned O
to O
work B-TER
in O
a O
stone O
quarry O
near O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
terribly O
hard O
and O
people B-TER
were O
dying B-TER
off O
daily O
. O

In O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
there O
were O
too O
many O
of O
us O
, O
so O
the O
Lagerführer B-TER
gave O
an O
order O
to O
the O
capos B-TER
and O
the O
Kommandoführer B-TER
saying O
look O
, O
here O
is O
the O
commando O
, O
bring O
home O
10 O
- O
20 O
people O
dead O
. O

Whether O
they O
wanted O
or O
not O
, O
they O
had O
to O
beat O
some O
people B-TER
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
Lagerführer O
came O
in O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
to O
count O
how O
many O
people B-TER
had O
been O
actually O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
spite O
of O
those O
acts O
there O
were O
still O
too O
many O
prisoners B-TER
, O
as O
far O
as O
they O
judged O
. O

Therefore O
we O
were O
sent O
further O
to O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
. O

That O
camp B-TER
was O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
high O
mountain O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
get O
there O
we O
had O
to O
climb O
stairs O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
. O

We O
were O
at O
such O
a O
great O
height O
, O
that O
even O
going O
for O
our O
breakfast B-TER
was O
hard O
. O

We O
would O
have O
rather O
not O
had O
food B-TER
than O
go O
up O
this O
height O
. O

On O
these O
occasions O
the O
capos B-TER
started O
to O
do O
their O
job O
, O
and O
until O
they O
collected O
six O
people B-TER
to O
send O
for O
lunch B-TER
, O
they O
had O
beaten O
20 O
people B-TER
to O
death B-TER
, O
because O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
walk O
any O
more O
. O

Capos B-TER
hit O
people B-TER
so O
hard O
that O
they O
fell O
and O
he O
continued O
the O
beating O
until O
their O
victims O
died B-TER
at O
their O
feet O
. O

After O
two O
miserable O
weeks O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Mühldorf B-LOC
. O

A O
so O
- O
called O
Hauptbaustelle O
( O
main O
construction O
site O
) O
was O
being O
built O
here O
. O

It O
needed O
a O
lot O
of O
workforce B-TER
: O
about O
5000 O
- O
6000 O
of O
us O
worked B-TER
there O
. O

My O
job B-TER
was O
carrying O
cement O
. O

I O
had O
to O
carry O
50 O
- O
kilogram O
cement O
bags O
up O
to O
the O
mixers O
. O

People B-TER
became O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
on O
daily O
basis O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

Later O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
Lagerältesters B-TER
were O
criminals O
sentenced B-TER
to O
10 O
- O
15 O
years O
for O
murder B-TER
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
were O
appointed O
as O
our O
lords O
and O
they O
became O
our O
gods O
. O

As O
I O
have O
told O
before O
, O
I O
became O
a O
cook O
. O

One O
time O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
they O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
cook O
, O
so O
I O
applied O
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
this O
job O
. O

I O
was O
doing O
relatively O
well O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
could O
be O
good O
to O
see O
my O
fellow O
prisoners B-TER
starving B-TER
and O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
help O
them O
. O

I O
was O
there O
until O
I O
fell O
ill B-TER
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

Then O
I O
was O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
quarantine O
camp B-TER
and O
stayed O
there O
until O
April O
25 O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
greatest O
crisis O
I O
was O
lying O
ill O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
fever B-TER
of O
40 O
- O
41.6 O
degrees O
Celsius O
. O

Two O
of O
my O
companions B-TER
came O
for O
me O
, O
because O
our O
camp B-TER
was O
evacuated B-TER
and O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
me O
behind O
. O

Otherwise O
I O
would O
not O
have O
survived O
, O
as O
those O
who O
stayed O
behind O
were O
finished O
off O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
took O
me O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
smuggled O
me O
out O
. O

I O
travelled O
for O
six O
days O
still O
having O
a O
high B-TER
fever I-TER
until O
we O
managed O
to O
reach B-TER
the I-TER
Americans I-TER
. O

They O
assembled O
us O
there O
, O
and O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
hospital B-TER
and O
got O
over O
the O
typhus B-TER
. I-TER

I O
was O
there O
until O
I O
fully O
recovered O
. O

We O
received O
food B-TER
parcels O
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
everything O
we O
needed O
. O

I O
can O
not O
find O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
live O
at O
home O
without O
her O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to O
Palestine B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
During O
the O
rule O
of O
the O
Czechs B-TER
we O
did O
very O
well O
in O
Várpalánka B-LOC
. O

They O
never O
abused O
Jews O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
equal O
rights O
with O
the O
others O
. O

When O
the O
Hungarians B-TER
came O
in O
, O
they O
took O
away O
the O
trade O
licenses O
and O
abused B-TER
the I-TER
Jewish I-TER
inhabitants I-TER
of O
the O
village O
quite O
a O
lot O
. O

There O
was O
a O
garrison O
in O
the O
village O
and O
the O
soldiers B-TER
marching O
there O
sang O
satirical O
songs O
, O
the O
target O
of O
which O
was O
Jews O
. O

Later O
, O
incited O
by O
young O
ethnic O
Germans B-TER
they O
broke O
in O
some O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
led O
by O
officers O
called O
Kiss B-PER
and O
István B-PER
Boldog I-PER
. O

They O
went O
to O
Munkács B-LOC
every O
evening O
and O
they O
broke O
in O
Jewish O
houses O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
those O
were O
military B-TER
exercises O
. O

They O
robbed O
the O
Jews O
of O
every O
possession O
and O
beat O
them O
to O
a O
pulp O
. O

They O
came O
back O
to O
Palánka B-LOC
at O
12 O
o'clock O
at O
night O
and O
continued O
with O
us O
. O

Terrible O
noises O
, O
screams O
could O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
night O
. O

We O
lived O
through O
terrible O
times O
, O
trembling O
in O
horrible O
fear O
; O
that O
was O
the O
time O
when O
I O
got O
a O
heart O
ailment O
. O

The O
army B-TER
terrorized O
the O
inhabitants O
all O
the O
time O
and O
beat B-TER
Jewish I-TER
men I-TER
horribly I-TER
without O
any O
reason O
. O

A O
lance O
corporal O
called O
Vörös B-PER
also O
behaved O
in O
such O
a O
base O
way O
that O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
in O
the O
evening O
at O
all O
. O

That O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
terror O
for O
us O
. O

Then O
we O
already O
had O
to O
be O
in O
hiding B-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
; O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
sleep O
at O
home O
, O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
at O
our O
relatives O
living O
in O
nearby O
towns O
, O
where O
we O
slept B-TER
in I-TER
barns I-TER
and I-TER
haylofts I-TER
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
had O
already O
treated O
us O
in O
an O
inhuman O
and O
cruel O
way O
before O
the O
German B-TER
invasion O
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
committed O
more O
horrible O
tortures O
than O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
completely O
ruined O
us O
psychically O
. O

70 O
Jewish O
families O
lived O
in O
Várpalánka B-LOC
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
tradesmen O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
lived O
in O
good O
financial O
conditions O
and O
were O
not O
short O
of O
anything O
. O

I O
was O
a O
dressmaker O
and O
I O
earned O
as O
much O
as O
I O
needed O
. O

It O
was O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
police B-TER
of O
Munkács B-LOC
who O
ordered O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
decrees I-TER
against O
us O
. O

The O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
village O
behaved O
in O
a O
relatively O
considerate O
way O
, O
except O
the O
ethnic O
German B-TER
members O
of O
the O
organization O
Jugendheiz O
, O
who O
were O
the O
followers O
of O
Hitler B-PER
and O
acted O
in O
a O
shameful O
manner O
towards O
us O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
give O
10,000 O
pengős O
to O
the O
notary O
's O
office O
in O
order O
to O
let O
us O
stay O
in O
the O
village O
but O
they O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
. O

After O
Passover B-TER
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
in O
the O
brickyard O
of O
Munkács B-LOC
. O

There O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
forced O
the O
men B-TER
to O
crawl O
on O
their O
bellies O
in O
the O
mud O
and O
hit O
their O
heads O
with O
rifle O
butts O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
and O
3 O
Germans B-TER
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
called O
Sefcsenko B-PER
, O
beat O
the O
young O
boys O
extremely O
hard O
, O
some O
of O
them O
they O
beat O
to O
death B-TER
. O

We O
were O
already O
so O
desperate O
that O
we O
could O
hardly O
wait O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
lied O
that O
they O
would O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Hortobágy B-LOC
. O

They O
entrained O
us O
in O
Munkács B-LOC
but O
they O
did O
not O
give O
us O
water O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
give O
us O
a O
bucket O
for O
toilet O
purposes O
. O

In O
Sátoraljaújhely B-LOC
, O
Jewish O
labour B-TER
servicemen I-TER
saw O
us O
and O
they O
wanted O
to O
give O
us O
water O
, O
which O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
did O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
do O
so O
. O

80 O
of O
us O
were O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
: O
fainting O
old O
people O
, O
crying O
little O
children B-TER
. O

They O
handed O
us O
over O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
told O
us O
that O
they O
would O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
at O
a O
good O
place O
. O

On O
our O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
they O
separated B-TER
me O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family B-TER
and O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
was O
in O
store O
for O
me O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
want O
to O
believe O
it O
from O
a O
Slovakian B-TER
woman B-TER
there O
that O
they O
were O
burning O
our O
family B-TER
members O
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

They O
took O
all O
the O
expectant O
mothers B-TER
away O
and O
still O
we O
managed O
to O
hide O
an O
expectant O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
gave O
birth O
to O
her O
child B-TER
in O
secret O
; O
of O
course O
we O
arranged O
it O
so O
that O
the O
child B-TER
would O
not O
remain O
alive O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Geislingen B-LOC
, O
we O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
place O
to O
stay O
, O
because O
we O
could O
sit O
at O
a O
table O
, O
where O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

We O
did O
well O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
but O
later O
German B-TER
Capos B-TER
came O
and O
stole O
our O
food B-TER
. I-TER

We O
slept O
in O
cold O
rooms O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
worked B-TER
in O
a O
factory O
, O
which O
was O
not O
heated O
. O

Our O
hands O
got O
frostbitten O
and O
the O
flesh O
between O
our O
fingers O
cracked O
. O

After O
Passover B-TER
, O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Münchenallsch O
where O
we O
stayed O
only O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
they O
entrained O
us O
. O

We O
did O
not O
receive O
anything O
else O
to O
eat B-TER
than O
a O
little O
bread B-TER
for O
a O
week O
. O

We O
starved B-TER
very O
, O
very O
much O
, O
we O
lost O
weight O
, O
we O
were O
nothing O
but O
skin O
and O
bones O
and O
several O
men B-TER
died B-TER
. I-TER

The O
American B-TER
troops O
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
1st O
May O
. O

They O
supplied O
us O
with O
the O
best O
things O
imaginable O
, O
like O
first O
- O
class O
food B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
shoes O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
Illdorf B-LOC
near O
Stahldoch O
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
then O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
home O
for O
members O
of O
the O
Hitlerjugend B-ORG
in O
Feldafing B-LOC
. O

We O
received O

A O
Czech B-TER
soldie B-TER
r O
came O
for O
us O
and O
told O
us O
not O
to O
speak O
Hungarian B-TER
anywhere O
; O
they O
put O
us O
in O
a O
car O
and O
after O
a O
nine O
- O
hour O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Pilsen B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
Czech B-TER
villages O
, O
children B-TER
, O
old O
people O
and O
men B-TER
ran O
to O
meet O
us O
and O
received O
us O
very O
happily O
. O

We O
were O
crying O
from O
emotion O
when O
we O
saw O
that O
welcome O
boards O
were O
put O
on O
view O
and O
mothers B-TER
were O
holding O
their O
children B-TER
up O
in O
the O
windows O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Prague B-LOC
by O
bus O
and O
from O
there O
, O
we O
came O
to O
Pest B-LOC
through O
Pozsony B-LOC
. O

Now O
I O
am O
going O
home O
to O
see O
whether O
my O
little O
son B-TER
is O
there O
and O
then O
we O
will O
go B-TER
together O
to O
Palestine B-TER
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
living O
among O
the O
evil O
people O
at O
home O
, O
so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
work O
on O
building O
of O
our O
new O
homeland O
in O
Palestine B-TER

Fanny B-PER
Günzenberger I-PER
presents O
the O
following O
: O
My O
personal O
tragedy O
started O
in O
1941 O
, O
when O
they O
collected O
Jews O
of O
Polish B-TER
origin O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

That O
time O
, O
they O
took O
me O
and O
my O
parents O
, O
5 O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
of O
mine O
and O
a O
great O
number O
of O
relatives O
. O

No O
one O
remained O
alive O
except O
for O
me O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
from O
Kamenetz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Podolsk I-LOC
before O
they O
shot B-TER
all O
those O
enormous O
number O
of O
Jews O
. O

The O
way O
back O
was O
really O
horrible O
, O
I O
dared O
to O
walk O
only O
during O
the O
night O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
ditches O
. O

During O
the O
day O
I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
stack O
of O
hay O
or O
in O
a O
stall O
. O

I O
ate B-TER
what O
I O
found O
on O
the O
fields O
and O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
edible O
plants O
, O
carrots B-TER
, O
and O
potatoes B-TER
. O

For O
me O
, O
the O
suffering O
in O
Germany B-TER
was O
not O
a O
surprise O
or O
a O
novelty O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
back O
into O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
however O
I O
did O
not O
return O
to O
our O
village O
but O
worked O
for O
Jewish O
families B-TER
in O
Ungvár B-LOC
. O

In O
1943 O
, O
when O
Germans B-TER
entered O
the O
country O
, O
they O
constructed O
the O
ghetto B-TER
in O
Ungvár B-LOC
soon O
, O
and O
all O
Jews O
had O
to O
enter O
it O
. O

We O
still O
lived B-TER
well O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
disregarding O
that O
they O
beat O
and O
interrogated O
richer O
Jews O
to O
find O
out O
where O
they O
hid O
their O
valuables O
. O

Around O
6 O
weeks O
later O
, O
we O
were O
entrained O
and O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
after O
a O
three O
- O
day O
- O
long O
miserable O
journey O
. O

Here O
they O
immediately O
separated B-TER
strong O
people B-TER
suitable O
for O
hard O
work B-TER
from O
the O
elderly O
, O
the O
young O
and O
the O
weak O
. O

They O
took O
us O
into O
the O
baths O
, O
seized O
our O
belongings O
, O
cut O
our O
hair O
, O
washed O
us O
, O
and O
let O
us O
stay O
nude O
in O
the O
cold O
room O
for O
hours O
before O
they O
gave O
us O
some O
ragged O
clothes B-TER
. O

They O
led O
us O
into O
a O
barrack B-TER
where O
there O
was O
empty O
place O
only O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

We O
spent O
all O
the O
time O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
queuing O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

From O
the O
morning O
till O
noon O
there O
was O
a O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
then O
there O
was O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
before O
lunch O
, O
and O
another O
two O
hours O
waiting O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

In O
between O
, O
the O
hut O
was O
cleaned O
and O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
open O
. O

There O
were O
frequent O
selections B-TER
causing O
always O
terrible O
anxiety O
as O
we O
already O
knew O
what O
they O
meant O
, O
why O
flames O
were O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
chimneys O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
day O
and O
night O
. O

Only O
10 O
days O
passed O
before O
they O
selected B-TER
me O
into O
a O
transport B-TER
for O
work B-TER
. O

They O
made O
me O
have O
another O
bath O
and O
put O
me O
on O
a O
train B-TER
heading O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
glad O
that O
the O
two O
of O
us O
who O
knew O
each O
other O
still O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
could O
stay O
together O
, O
and O
that O
we O
got O
out O
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
that O
meant O
constant O
anxiety O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
a O
better O
situation O
either O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

Food B-TER
was O
extremely O
scarce B-TER
, O
treatment O
was O
cruel O
. O

People B-TER
were O
beaten O
up O
all O
the O
time O
. O

We O
had O
to O
do O
some O
awfully O
difficult O
work B-TER
carrying O
heavy O
loads O
. O

Every O
day O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
died B-TER
here O
. O

Luckily O
, O
we O
did O
not O
stay O
here O
long O
either O
but O
set O
off O
soon O
for O
Salzwedel B-LOC
. O

The O
lager O
in O
Salzwedel B-LOC
was O
small O
, O
altogether O
1,300 O
women B-TER
were O
kept O
here O
. O

They O
treated O
us O
less O
cruelly O
as O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
. O

Daily O
food B-TER
comprised O
of O
half O
litre O
of O
black O
coffee B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
and O
the O
evening O
, O
some O
watery O
vegetable O
soup B-TER
at O
noon O
and O
200 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Sometimes O
we O
got O
20 O
grams O
of O
margarine B-TER
, O
or O
marmalade B-TER
. O

We O
were O
awfully O
starving B-TER
. O

We O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
work B-TER
to O
do O
even O
if O
it O
was O
not O
so O
difficult O
. O

Mostly O
we O
shovelled O
sand O
and O
pebbles O
for O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

Many O
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
. O

Everyone O
was O
as O
thin O
as O
a O
skeleton O
. O

When O
Americans B-TER
got O
closer O
they O
wanted O
to O
take O
us O
away O
but O
had O
no O
time O
to O
do O
so O
as O
Americans B-TER
already O
arrived B-TER
into I-TER
the I-TER
camp I-TER
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
In O
1941 O
, O
I O
lived O
in O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
, O
my O
parents B-TER
owned O
land O
, O
and O
even O
two O
houses O
, O
I O
had O
three O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
. O

My O
father O
was O
taken O
into O
Poland O
The O
testimony O
is O
not O
precise O
. O

The O
survivor O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
occupied O
zone O
of O
the O
former O
Ukraine O
, O
later O
they O
also O
took O
me O
, O
my O
older O
brother O
, O
and O
my O
older O
sister O
. O

They O
left O
me O
on O
a O
cornfield O
, O
from O
where O
I O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
and O
came O
back O
to O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
crossing O
the O
Dnyeszter B-LOC
. O

I O
went O
into O
hiding B-TER
for O
nine O
months O
on O
the O
attic O
. O

Once O
an O
Ukrainian B-TER
woman B-TER
noticed O
how O
much O
my O
sister O
cooked O
and O
baked O
and O
got O
suspicious O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
my O
mother O
died B-TER
and O
as O
it O
started O
to O
be O
very O
dangerous O
staying O
on O
the O
attic O
we O
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
it O
was O
a O
Hungarian B-TER
shoemaker O
who O
denounced B-TER
us O
claiming O
that O
someone O
was O
hiding B-TER
on O
the O
attic O
. O

Gendarmes B-TER
searched O
the O
house O
. O

Here O
, O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Supportive I-ORG
Office I-ORG
put O
me O
into O
an O
orphanage B-TER
where O
I O
stayed O
for O
two O
years O
, O
when O
I O
was O
summoned O
for O
labourservice B-TER
in O
June O
of O
1944 O
. O

I O
got O
to O
Budafok B-LOC
where O
they O
took B-TER
all O
my O
belongings O
, O
my O
watch O
, O
and O
my O
money O
. O

There O
was O
a O
Hungarian B-TER
warrant B-TER
officer I-TER
who O
beat O
us O
up O
terribly O
. O

He O
made O
the O
people O
from O
the O
orphanage B-TER
standing O
aside O
and O
he O
meant O
to O
send O
us O
home O
, O
but O
later O
changed O
his O
mind O
. O

From O
here O
we O
got O
to O
the O
brick O
factory O
of O
Budakalász B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
ghetto B-TER
for O
the O
people O
from O
the O
agglomeration O
of O
Pest B-LOC
we O
were O
entrained B-TER
74 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
car O
. O

We O
got O
water O
at O
departure O
and O
were O
escorted O
by O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
till O
Kassa B-LOC
where O
the O
train B-TER
was O
handed O
over O
to O
Germans B-TER
, O
who O
gave O
no O
water O
but O
shot O
into O
to O
the O
freight O
cars O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
3rd O
of O
July O
, O
at O
10 O
am O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
prisoners B-TER
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
were O
waiting O
for O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
our O
luggage O
in O
the O
cars O
, O
and O
to O
queue O
up O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
separately O
. O

I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
the O
group O
for O
work B-TER
, O
and O
was O
taken O
into O
a O
baths O
where O
they O
cut O
my O
hair O
off O
and O
gave O
me O
striped O
clothes B-TER
. O

We O
were O
put O
into O
a O
barrack O
where O
they O
ordered O
us O
to O
present O
all O
our O
valuables O
because O
they O
claimed O
they O
had O
a O
machine O
that O
could O
see O
through O
us O
and O
if O
they O
found O
anything O
on O
you O
, O
you O
were O
going O
to O
be O
hanged B-TER
. O

We O
got O
into O
Camp B-LOC
A I-LOC
, O
where O
there O
were O
around O
600 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
block O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
crematorium B-TER
and O
often O
felt O
the O
smell O
of O
burnt O
bones O
but O
they O
told O
us O
they O
were O
burning O
old O
clothes B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
twice O
there O
was O
a O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
that O
lasted O
for O
hours O
; O
food B-TER
was O
scarce B-TER
. O

After O
a O
selection B-TER
I O
was O
sent O
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
was O
around O
four O
days O
long O
, O
we O
were O
50 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
freight O
car O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
although O
there O
was O
food B-TER
in O
the O
car O
but O
they O
kept O
it O
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
starve B-TER
all O
the O
way O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
we O
had O
a O
bath O
and O
received O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, I-TER
margarine I-TER
, O
jam B-TER
and O
sausage B-TER
. O

They O
put O
us O
up O
in O
the O
tent O
camp B-TER
which O
was O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
they O
sent O
us O
from O
here O
to O
Remmsdorf B-LOC
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
again O
three O
days O
, O
we O
were O
50 O
of O
us O
again O
in O
a O
car O
and O
received O
two O
third O
of O
a O
loaf B-TER
, O
margarine B-TER
and O
jam B-TER
. O

The O
day O
after O
that O
we O
arrived O
, O
I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
work B-TER
in O
a O
petrol O
company O
called O
Brabach B-ORG
where O
I O
worked B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

The O
lager B-TER
lay O
approximately O
2 O
kilometres O
away O
from O
the O
plant O
. O

650 O
of O
us O
stayed O
in O
a O
barrack B-TER
, O
two O
in O
a O
bed O
. O

Hungarian B-TER
speaking O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
guarded O
us O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
often O
beat O
us O
up O
. O

If O
they O
simply O
did O
not O
like O
someone O
they O
made O
him O
get O
out O
of O
line O
and O
killed B-TER
him O
. O

I O
saw O
once O
that O
they O
killed B-TER
someone O
with O
a O
blow O
in O
the O
outlying O
kommando B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
in O
the O
winter O
there O
were O
40 O
- O
50 O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
, O
food B-TER
was O
scarce B-TER
and O
it O
was O
very O
cold O
. O

Death B-TER
found O
a O
fertile O
soil O
here O
. O

Before O
Christmas O
, O
Americans B-TER
bombed B-TER
the O
plant O
but O
lowered O
yellow O
lamps O
from O
the O
aircrafts O
to O
indicate O
the O
place O
of O
the O
lager B-TER
, O
as O
a O
result O
, O
no O
one O
got O
hurt O
. O

For O
a O
while O
I O
served O
a O
Capo B-TER
as O
his O
servant O
. O

Remmsdorf B-LOC
is O
next O
to O
Leipzig B-LOC
. O

Later O
, O
our O
lager B-TER
started O
to O
clear O
debris O
, O
that O
was O
what O
I O
did O
, O
too O
. O

We O
got O
food B-TER
in O
the O
houses O
but O
we O
also O
stole O
when O
we O
could O
not O
get O
hold O
of O
it O
otherwise O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
March O
, O
American B-TER
troops O
were O
only O
3 O
- O
4 O
kilometres O
away O
. O

That O
night O
at O
1 O
am O
they O
quickly O
entrained O
us O
and O
we O
started O
off O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

We O
came O
till O
Tarienburg O
by O
train B-TER
when O
low O
- O
flying O
airplanes O
bombed B-TER
two O
of O
our O
railway O
engines O
. O

We O
had O
350 O
sick B-TER
people B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
were O
not O
sick B-TER
tried O
to O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
; O
we O
went O
to O
the O
village O
, O
and O
by O
the O
time O
we O
came O
back O
we O
saw O
that O
dead B-TER
bodies O
were O
being O
carrying O
: O
three O
cars O
were O
full O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies O
. O

We O
asked O
what O
had O
happened O
and O
were O
informed O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
had O
shot B-TER
those O
unfortunate O
. O

At O
this O
point O
we O
started O
walking B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
could O
not O
keep O
pace O
and O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
road O
were O
cruelly O
shot O
by O
the O
guards O
. O

When O
we O
started O
our O
journey O
we O
were O
in O
3,800 O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
when O
we O
arrived O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
there O
were O
only O
800 O
of O
us O
alive O
, O
but O
around O
the O
half O
died B-TER
of O
typhus B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

The O
9th O
of O
May O
, O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
in O
the O
town O
. O

I O
stayed O
three O
weeks O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
before O
we O
left O
for O
Prague B-LOC
already O
in O
a O
bigger O
group O
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
I O
spent O
three O
weeks O
at O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
, O
where O
we O
were O
disinfected O
and O
provided O
with O
everything O
good O
. O

I O
came O
home O
through O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Pozsony B-LOC
. O

My O
future O
plan O
: O
I O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
On O
the O
20th O
of O
March O
1944 O
, O
a O
day O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
I O
wanted O
to O
send O
a O
pack O
to O
my O
husband O
who O
was O
in O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
with O
one O
of O
his O
comrades O
, O
who O
spent O
his O
days O
off O
at O
home O
and O
was O
travelling O
back O
the O
same O
day O
. O

I O
asked O
a O
policeman B-TER
whether O
I O
could O
enter O
the O
building O
of O
the O
railway O
station O
. O

He O
politely O
responded O
Just O
come O
in O
, O
and O
he O
right O
away O
put O
me O
in O
the O
line O
of O
other O
captured O
Jews O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
they O
took O
me O
to O
Kistarcsa B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
29th O
of O
April O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

The O
first O
weeks O
in O
Kistarcsa B-LOC
were O
awful O
. O

10 O
- O
12 O
people B-TER
lay O
on O
a O
straw B-TER
mattress I-TER
without O
any O
cover O
or O
provision O
. O

The O
only O
food B-TER
we O
got O
was O
sent O
to O
us O
by O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
National I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Aid I-ORG
Action I-ORG
. O

There O
was O
a O
policeman B-TER
called O
Bakos B-PER
, O
who O
was O
infinitely O
cruel O
to O
us O
. O

He O
destroyed O
us O
mentally O
. O

He O
kept O
telling O
us O
that O
You O
would O
not O
go O
home O
from O
here O
any O
more O
. O

It O
appeared O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
right O
because O
we O
had O
to O
leave B-TER
for O
Auschwitz B-LOC
the O
28th O
of O
April O
. O

There O
were O
78 O
people B-TER
in O
the O
freight O
car O
: O
50 O
women B-TER
and O
28 O
men B-TER
. O

We O
arrived O
after O
a O
day O
of O
travel O
. O

On O
arrival O
, O
they O
asked O
us O
at O
the O
station O
whether O
someone O
was O
sick B-TER
or O
unable O
to O
walk O
. O

Naturally O
, O
many O
volunteered O
. O

They O
were O
sent O
directly O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

In O
those O
days O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
far O
away O
, O
and O
later O
we O
- O
the O
first O
Hungarian B-TER
transport B-TER
– O
built O
the O
rail O
on O
which O
the O
train B-TER
could O
come O
closer O
. O

For O
three O
weeks O
we O
stayed O
in O
a O
so O
- O
called O
quarantine O
before O
I O
got O
into O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
together O
with O
150 O
others O
. O

The O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
used O
to O
open O
the O
luggage O
and O
sort O
out O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
the O
deported B-TER
. O

We O
received O
better O
treatment O
, O
and O
wore O
the O
same O
striped O
clothes B-TER
and O
red O
headscarves B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
here O
around O
four O
months O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
with O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
dead B-TER
people I-TER
. O

We O
found O
documents O
and O
photos O
in O
their O
pockets O
. O

Mentally O
, O
this O
work O
destroyed O
us O
completely O
. O

It O
was O
horrible O
to O
see O
the O
chimneys B-TER
throwing O
out O
fire O
everyday O
, O
and O
to O
see O
the O
pits O
on O
fire O
from O
afar O
. O

Dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
were O
so O
numerous O
that O
the O
crematoria B-TER
did O
not O
have O
the O
capacities O
to O
burn O
them O
all O
so O
they O
burnt O
people B-TER
also O
in O
pits O
out O
in O
the O
open O
. O

There O
were O
transports B-TER
that O
arrived O
during O
the O
night O
and O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
without O
selections B-TER
. O

There O
were O
nights O
when O
they O
burnt O
25,000 O
people B-TER
. O

People B-TER
from O
the O
last O
Hungarian B-TER
transport B-TER
came O
from O
Újpest B-LOC
and O
the O
neighbourhoods O
of O
Pest B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
there O
was O
less O
work B-TER
to O
do O
because O
no O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
so O
the O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
was O
dismissed O
. O

My O
last O
horrible O
memory O
working O
in O
the O
Kanada B-ORG
is O
the O
episode O
when O
men B-TER
, O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
, O
were O
brought O
to O
our O
place O
and O
gassed B-TER
in O
the O
room O
where O
the O
Kanada B-ORG
used O
to O
gas B-TER
clothes B-TER
. O

For O
four O
weeks O
I O
was O
in O
quarantine O
from O
where O
I O
got O
into O
an O
Aussenkommando B-TER
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
an O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
beat O
me O
almost O
to O
death B-TER
with O
no O
apparent O
reason O
only O
because O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O

He O
was O
treading O
on O
me O
, O
kicking O
me O
, O
and O
he O
broke O
three O
of O
my O
ribs O
. O

The O
German B-TER
head I-TER
doctor I-TER
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
prepared O
a O
report O
( O
so O
- O
called O
Meldung O
) O
about O
it O
, O
since O
it O
was O
too O
much O
even O
for O
him O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
hospital B-TER
for O
8 O
days O
, O
and O
I O
could O
stay O
another O
week O
in O
the O
block O
for O
the O
convalescent O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
was O
transferred O
into O
the O
commando B-TER
of O
the O
weaving O
mill O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
horrible O
. O

If O
we O
did O
not O
weave O
the O
expected O
quantity O
they O
would O
beat O
us O
. O

The O
road O
to O
the O
workplace O
led O
through O
totally O
muddy O
parts O
and O
we O
crossed O
them O
without O
shoes B-TER
and O
warm O
clothes B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
October O
, O
also O
the O
commando B-TER
of O
the O
weaving O
mill O
was O
moved O
into O
Camp B-LOC
C I-LOC
. O

This O
was O
even O
more O
horrible O
because O
the O
rain O
fell O
into O
the O
block O
. O

We O
stood O
there O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
and O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
afterwards O
. O

It O
also O
happened O
that O
they O
were O
disinfecting O
us O
all O
the O
night O
and O
we O
could O
not O
sleep O
at O
all O
but O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
all O
the O
same O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
kitchen O
moved O
and O
it O
meant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
get O
a O
bite O
of O
food B-TER
from O
Sunday O
noon O
till O
Wednesday O
evening O
. O

They O
said O
it O
was O
a O
punishment O
but O
we O
never O
found O
out O
for O
what O
. O

When O
they O
wanted O
to O
make O
Aryan B-TER
people O
work O
in O
the O
weaving O
mill O
the O
Jews O
were O
dismissed O
and O
I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
a O
transport B-TER
the O
29th O
of O
November O
. O

They O
took O
me O
to O
St. B-LOC
Gheorgenthal I-LOC
, O
where O
I O
worked B-TER
for O
an O
aircraft O
parts O
plant O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
there O
were O
only O
200 O
people O
working B-TER
there O
guarded O
by O
10 O
Aufseherins B-TER
. O

These O
Aufseherins B-TER
were O
quite O
nice O
when O
compared O
to O
those O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

When O
Russians B-ORG
approached O
us O
they O
brought O
here O
prisoners B-TER
from O
various O
camps B-TER
, O
and O
also O
the O
SS B-TER
came O
with O
them O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
life O
became O
hell O
also O
here O
. O

They O
would O
keep O
beating O
us O
. O

We O
dug O
trenches O
, O
and O
they O
forced O
us O
to O
get O
prepared O
to O
counter O
the O
enemy O
. O

On O
the O
20th O
of O
December O
, O
I O
fell O
sick B-TER
with O
pneumonia B-TER
and O
typhus B-TER
that O
had O
an O
effect O
later O
also O
on O
my O
legs O
. O

The O
9th O
of O
May O
, O
the O
Russians B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

I O
spent O
another O
two O
weeks O
in O
hospital B-TER
before O
I O
came O
home O
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
In O
1941 O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
into O
Poland O
The O
testimony O
is O
not O
precise O
. O

The O
survivor O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
occupied O

of O
the O
former O
Ukraine O
. O

together O
with O
my O
father O
and O
six O
brothers O
, O
from O
where O
I O
managed O
to O
run O
away O
. O

When O
Hungary B-TER
was O
reunited O
with O
its O
historical O
parts O
I O
was O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
but O
I O
took O
days O
off O
to O
visit O
my O
parents O
home O
, O
and O
we O
were O
all O
deported B-TER
during O
these O
two O
weeks O
into O
Poland O
The O
testimony O
is O
not O
precise O
. O

The O
survivor O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
occupied O
zone O
of O
the O
former O
Ukraine O
. O

. O

They O
crossed O
the O
borders O
with O
us O
and O
then O
let O
us O
free O
telling O
us O
to O
go O
wherever O
we O
wanted O
to O
. O

We O
crossed O
the O
Polish O
The O
testimony O
is O
not O
precise O
. O

The O
survivor O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
occupied O
zone O
of O
the O
former O
Ukraine O
. O

border O
at O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
, O
we O
could O
not O
turn O
back O
as O
they O
would O
have O
killed B-TER
us O
but O
could O
continue O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
country O
. O

In O
Poland O
The O
testimony O
is O
not O
precise O
. O

The O
survivor O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
occupied O
zone O
of O
the O
former O
Ukraine O
. O

we O
got O
into O
a O
forest O
where O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
were O
shooting O
at O
us O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
saw O
how O
they O
shot B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
and O
my O
brothers B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
. O

I O
managed O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
and O
walked O
fast O
till O
Volóc B-LOC
, O
this O
is O
how O
I O
got O
back O
to O
Hungary B-TER
. O

Not O
much O
later O
, O
I O
came O
to O
my O
firm O
in O
Pest B-LOC
but O
was O
summoned O
already O
at O
the O
end O
of O
1943 O
( O
41 O
) O
to O
do O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
in O
Jászberény B-LOC
where O
I O
passed O
five O
months O
before O
I O
was O
transferred O
into O
a O
company O
in O
Pest B-LOC
. O

From O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1942 O
till O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1944 O
, O
I O
was O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
in O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
air I-TER
raid I-TER
company I-TER
, O
then O
I O
was O
put O
into O
an O
unfamiliar O
company O
. O

Having O
entrained O
75 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
car O
at O
Józsefváros B-LOC
railway O
station O
they O
carried O
to O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
journey O
sitting O
people B-TER
kept O
swapping O
with O
standing O
ones O
as O
space O
was O
so O
little O
that O
we O
could O
not O
sit O
down O
all O
. O

We O
were O
escorted O
by O
gendarmes B-TER
till O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
border O
where O
they O
gave O
us O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

In O
the O
car O
someone O
committed O
suicide B-TER
, O
and O
two O
weak O
people B-TER
were O
trodden O
to O
death B-TER
. O

At O
the O
Austrian B-TER
border O
they O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
we O
got O
bread B-TER
and O
zulag B-TER
. O

There O
were O
3,500 O
people B-TER
in O
our O
transport B-TER
and O
the O
journey O
lasted O
ten O
days O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
a O
collecting O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
they O
disinfected O
us O
, O
seized O
what O
they O
could O
and O
dressed O
us O
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
and O
wooden O
shoes O
. O

In O
Oranienburg B-LOC
we O
were O
grouped O
according O
to O
professions O
, O
this O
is O
how O
I O
got O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
- I-LOC
Siemensstadt I-LOC
, O
next O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Here O
they O
selected B-TER
the O
strong O
and O
the O
weak O
. O

I O
was O
put O
into O
an O
outlying O
kommando B-TER
, O
we O
carried O
iron O
railway O
lines O
, O
railway O
sleepers O
, O
which O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
job O
. O

For O
this O
work B-TER
we O
had O
the O
worst O
possible O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
. O

There O
was O
an O
SS B-TER
foreman O
who O
got O
there O
because O
of O
punishment O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
distributed O
the O
food B-TER
giving O
us O
only O
three O
quarters O
of O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
instead O
of O
a O
litre O
, O
and O
stole O
also O
from O
the O
bread B-TER
portions O
, O
so O
we O
became O
really O
weak O
, O
many O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
, O
and O
often O
we O
ate O
also O
potato B-TER
peels I-TER
. O

These O
foremen O
and O
block O
leaders O
beat O
us O
with O
batons O
but O
we O
also O
suffered O
a O
lot O
of O
cold O
. O

One O
day O
I O
put O
a O
blanket O
under O
my O
clothes B-TER
but O
was O
noticed O
by O
the O
foreman O
who O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

They O
gripped O
my O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
gave O
me O
100 O
blows O
, O
another O
time O
I O
got O
a O
slap O
so O
strong O
that O
the O
eardrum O
broke O
. O

A O
great O
number O
of O
people B-TER
died B-TER
because O
of O
cold O
, O
of O
maltreatment O
and O
of O
starvation B-TER
, O
especially O
young O
boys O
. O

They O
often O
bombed B-TER
the O
Siemens B-ORG
company O
, O
at O
the O
end O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
burnt O
down O
so O
they O
took O
me O
back O
to O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
8 O
days O
when O
we O
got O
an O
order O
to O
set O
off O
as O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
already O
pretty O
close O
. O

We O
had O
to O
queue O
up O
immediately O
and O
leave O
but O
as O
we O
were O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
there O
was O
no O
food B-TER
left O
for O
us O
. O

We O
started O
our O
march B-TER
on O
foot O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
towards O
the O
sea O
, O
40 O
kilometres O
a O
day O
. O

We O
were O
starving B-TER
so O
much O
that O
on O
the O
way O
we O
attacked O
locust O
trees O
and O
finished O
all O
their O
leafs B-TER
but O
we O
were O
not O
particularly O
choosy O
, O
we O
ate O
also O
grass B-TER
. O

Once O
we O
noticed O
a O
potato B-TER
clamp O
and O
started O
to O
run O
to O
it O
but O
the O
SS B-TER
shot O
at O
us O
and O
I O
got O
a O
bullet O
in O
the O
head O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
left O
behind O
on O
the O
road O
were O
covered O
with O
a O
blanket O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
passed O
half O
a O
day O
, O
then O
I O
got O
out O
and O
ran B-TER
across O
the O
woods O
towards O
Schwerin B-LOC
. O

17 O
kilometres O
further O
I B-TER
met I-TER
the O
first O
American B-TER
soldier B-TER
. O

They O
put O
a O
bandage O
on O
my O
head O
and O
took O
me O
into O
a O
sanatorium B-TER
. O

This O
happened O
the O
2nd O
of O
May O
. O

Thereafter O
I O
had O
a O
good O
life O
, O
I O
got O
everything O
I O
wanted O
, O
and O
was O
carefully O
treated O
for O
a O
month O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Lübeck B-LOC
, O
and O
applied O
for O
one O
of O
the O
Czech B-TER
transports O
. O

I O
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
via O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Pozsony B-LOC
. O

My O
future O
plans O
: O
At O
the O
moment O
I O
work O
here O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
later O
I O
would O
like O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Palestine B-TER
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
On O
the O
10th O
of O
May O
1944 O
, O
a O
detective O
appeared O
in O
my O
flat O
and O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Svábhegy B-LOC
to O
testify O
in O
a O
case O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
detective O
reassured O
me O
with O
a O
smile O
that O
it O
was O
all O
nothing O
and O
I O
would O
be O
back O
home O
the O
same O
day O
. O

There O
was O
no O
interrogation B-TER
for O
two O
days O
. O

When O
finally O
I O
was O
interrogated B-TER
, O
they O
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
had O
participated O
in O
a O
certain O
excursion O
. O

I O
found O
out O
that O
some O
members O
of O
the O
company O
with O
whom O
I O
had O
indeed O
been O
on O
an O
excursion O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
, O
and O
I O
myself O
was O
also O
suspected O
. O

After O
the O
interrogation B-TER
, O
saying O
that O
they O
would O
take O
me O
home O
they O
took O
me O
into O
Rökk B-LOC
Szilárd I-LOC
street I-LOC
. O

Of O
course O
I O
never O
made O
it O
home O
, O
I O
was O
incarcerated O
in O
Rökk B-LOC
Szilárd I-LOC
Street I-LOC
for O
a O
month O
. O

Around O
the O
12th O
of O
June O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
into O
a O
camp B-TER
for O
the O
sick B-TER
in O
Szabolcs B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
where O
I O
could O
work O
as O
a O
doctor B-TER
. O

This O
camp B-TER
was O
emptied O
soon O
afterwards O
and O
I O
was O
again O
taken O
back O
into O
Rökk B-LOC
Szilárd I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
I O
was O
entrained O
at O
Keleti B-LOC
railway O
station O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
Kistarcsa B-LOC
, O
from O
where O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
three O
days O
later O
. O

I O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
the O
17th O
of O
June O
1944 O
. O

People B-TER
were O
sorted B-TER
out O
already O
at O
the O
station O
. O

Men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
had O
to O
stand O
separately B-TER
. O

Old O
people O
and O
children B-TER
were O
separated B-TER
from O
men B-TER
. O

In O
the O
baths O
, O
which O
was O
a O
huge O
building O
, O
we O
had O
to O
get O
completely O
naked O
. O

We O
could O
only O
keep O
our O
shoes B-TER
and O
glasses O
. O

They O
shaved O
our O
hair O
off O
also O
on O
our O
bodies O
. O

We O
were O
standing O
there O
naked O
for O
hours O
till O
finally O
we O
had O
a O
bath O
and O
were O
disinfected O
. O

We O
got O
rags O
in O
return O
for O
our O
clothes B-TER
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
check O
what O
size O
of O
clothing B-TER
would O
fit O
each O
person B-TER
. O

They O
gave O
long O
, O
baggy O
dresses B-TER
for O
small O
people B-TER
and O
vice O
versa O
. O

There O
were O
some O
who O
could O
parade O
in O
evening B-TER
dresses I-TER
… O
Soup B-TER
, O
toothbrush O
, O
towel O
? O
What O
for O
? O
I O
got O
into O
Camp B-LOC
C I-LOC
, O
which O
was O
a O
transport B-LOC
camp I-LOC
. O

I O
worked B-TER
here O
for O
two O
and O
a O
half O
months O
as O
a O
doctor B-TER
, O
therefore O
my O
rations B-TER
were O
somewhat O
better O
than O
those O
of O
simple O
bunk O
dweller O
. O

It O
was O
already O
a O
great O
thing O
that O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
sleep B-TER
on O
a O
bunk O
made O
for O
ca O
. O

5 O
people B-TER
with O
twelve O
, O
thirteen O
or O
fourteen O
other O
people B-TER
. O

In O
Camp B-LOC
C I-LOC
I O
saw O
many O
, O
very O
many O
selections B-TER
. O

It O
was O
awfully O
difficult O
to O
be O
a O
doctor B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

I O
did O
not O
work B-TER
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
was O
a O
block O
doctor B-TER
. O

It O
was O
very O
difficult O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
hide O
infectious B-TER
patients I-TER
. O

If O
one O
of O
two O
siblings O
finally O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
hospital B-TER
, O
this O
could O
mean O
that O
they O
would O
never O
see O
each O
other O
again O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
particularly O
enjoyed O
separating O
people B-TER
who O
belonged O
together O
. O

I O
saw O
Dr O
Mengele B-PER
a O
number O
of O
times O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
where O
they O
controlled O
day O
by O
day O
whether O
patients B-TER
were O
treated O
alright O
, O
whether O
they O
had O
enough O
food B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
it O
could O
happen O
that O
with O
a O
wave O
of O
his O
hand O
while O
whistling O
he O
sent B-TER
the O
person B-TER
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
about O
whose O
health O
he O
had O
been O
the O
most O
anxious O
the O
day O
before O
. O

On O
these O
occasions O
he O
was O
even O
more O
horrible O
than O
when O
he O
brutally O
kicked O
someone O
or O
pulled O
out O
his O
pistol O
. O

The O
doctors B-TER
working I-TER
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
told O
me O
that O
once O
a O
sick B-TER
young O
girl B-TER
managed O
to O
commit O
suicide B-TER
. O

She O
may O
have O
been O
less O
then O
20 O
, O
the O
miserable O
creature O
. O

When O
they O
told O
this O
to O
Mengele B-PER
, O
to O
whom O
the O
number O
of O
patients B-TER
had O
to O
be O
reported O
every O
day O
of O
course O
, O
he O
was O
startled O
and O
said O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
surprise O
on O
his O
face O
: O
Selbstmord O
? O
Warumdenn O
… O
So O
jung O
… O
After O
two O
months O
, O
from O
Camp B-LOC
C I-LOC
I O
went O
to O
F.K.L. B-LOC
( B-LOC
Camp I-LOC
A I-LOC
) I-LOC
, O
as O
a O
Verfügbar O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
for O
seven O
weeks O
in O
commissions B-TER
outside I-TER
the I-TER
camp I-TER
. O

A O
transport B-TER
of O
labourers B-TER
left O
for O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
assigned O
there O
as O
doctor B-TER
. O

I O
was O
in O
Sachenhausen B-LOC
for O
only O
one O
day O
before O
we O
carried O
on O
towards O
Berlin B-LOC
- I-LOC
Reinickendorf I-LOC
, O
and O
from O
there O
with O
a O
small O
Arbeitskommando B-TER
to O
nearby O
Schönholz B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
the O
doctor B-TER
of O
the O
transport B-TER
for O
two O
and O
a O
half O
months O
. O

On O
the O
17th O
of O
February O
1945 O
, O
I O
got O
into O
Ravensbrück B-LOC
as O
a O
patient B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
many O
selections B-TER
here O
, O
too O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
they O
had O
already O
gas B-TER
here O
as O
well O
. O

For O
when O
Auschwitz B-LOC
ceased O
to O
exist O
as O
such O
, O
the O
leader O
and O
specialist O
of O
the O
local O
crematorium B-TER
came O
to O
Ravensbrück B-LOC
to O
introduce O
the O
gas B-TER
system O
there O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
in O
Ravensbrück B-LOC
they O
had O
used O
poison O
before O
. O

On O
the O
29th O
of O
April O
1945 O
, O
they O
were O
driving O
and O
hurrying O
us O
from O
the O
approaching O
Russians B-ORG
for O
2 O
days O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
on O
the O
road O
and O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
wood O
, O
where O
the O
liberating B-TER
Russian B-ORG
troops I-ORG
found O
me O
. O

After O
my O
liberation B-TER
I O
worked O
for O
a O
while O
as O
a O
doctor B-TER
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Neustrelitz B-LOC
. O

As O
an O
interesting O
point O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
mention O
that O
at O
Berlin B-LOC
- I-LOC
Reinickendorf I-LOC
Arbeitskommando B-TER
only O
a O
certain O
percentage O
of O
the O
people B-TER
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
ill B-TER
. O

They O
would O
always O
ask O
how O
come O
so O
many O
Jews O
were O
ill B-TER
, O
after O
all O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
also O
had O
very O
little O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
If O
I O
had O
to O
and O
were O
able O
to O
present O
all O
the O
misery O
I O
experienced O
I O
could O
talk O
for O
weeks O
but O
I O
do O
not O
do O
it O
gladly O
as O
remembering O
is O
horrible O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
Aknaszlatina B-LOC
Hungarians B-TER
treated O
us O
in O
a O
horrible O
way O
. O

They O
terribly O
tortured O
us O
, O
grabbed B-TER
all I-TER
our I-TER
valuables I-TER
but O
that O
was O
not O
all O
. O

They O
said O
we O
kept O
treasures O
even O
under O
our O
skin O
, O
and O
they O
treated O
us O
accordingly O
. O

They O
searched O
us O
undressed O
, O
unfortunately O
not O
only O
us O
but O
also O
our O
wives B-TER
and O
daughters B-TER
. O

Even O
high O
- O
ranking O
officers O
watched O
this O
performance O
. O

When O
we O
learnt O
they O
were O
going O
to O
take O
us O
away O
we O
were O
glad O
to O
go O
. O

Anywhere O
, O
just O
away O
from O
there O
. O

Leaving O
behind O
Aknaszlatina B-LOC
we O
travelled O
90 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
freight B-TER
car I-TER
and O
arrived O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
three O
days O
later O
. O

On O
the O
way O
many O
of O
us O
died B-TER
in O
the O
freight O
car O
because O
we O
got O
no O
water O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-LOC
we O
had O
to O
get O
off O
the O
train B-TER
and O
leave O
our O
entire O
luggage O
behind O
. O

Women B-TER
were O
led O
to O
the O
right O
, O
three O
of O
us O
brothers O
and O
my O
father O
to O
the O
left O
. O

Having O
walked O
a O
little O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
also O
our O
father O
was O
separated B-TER
from O
us O
. O

The O
day O
after O
, O
we O
were O
moved O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
three O
days O
. O

We O
got O
tattoos O
here O
and O
went O
on O
to O
Buna B-LOC
, O
8 O
kilometres O
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
lay O
cables O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

We O
had O
to O
carry O
heavy O
cables O
in O
a O
distance O
of O
4 O
kilometres O
; O
my O
back O
aches O
even O
today O
if O
I O
think O
of O
it O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
our O
camp B-TER
was O
clean O
and O
we O
also O
got O
food B-TER
. O

They O
harmed O
only O
those O
who O
could O
not O
work B-TER
, O
but O
they O
would O
beat O
these O
people B-TER
ruthlessly O
. O

When O
the O
front O
got O
closer O
they O
transferred O
us O
into O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

We O
travelled O
130 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
little O
open O
freight O
car O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
of O
January O
. O

We O
received O
500 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
. O

Many O
perished B-TER
during O
this O
journey O
. O

12,000 O
people B-TER
departed O
but O
I O
doubt O
there O
were O
as O
many O
as O
6,000 O
of O
us O
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

When O
we O
got O
off O
the O
train B-TER
the O
SS B-TER
immediately O
approached O
and O
shot O
the O
people B-TER
who O
could O
not O
walk O
but O
sat O
down O
. O

Naturally O
, O
we O
had O
to O
watch O
it O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
; O
otherwise O
they O
would O
have O
shot O
us O
as O
well O
, O
since O
they O
had O
the O
weapon O
. O

In O
Buchenwald B-LOC
we O
got O
into O
quarantine O
. O

We O
did O
not O
work B-TER
here O
at O
all O
as O
this O
was O
a O
selecting B-TER
place O
. O

In O
the O
cold O
of O
January O
, O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
of O
the O
mornings O
we O
were O
being O
lined O
up O
for O
2 O
- O
6 O
hours O
during O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
suffer O
unbearably O
. O

Many O
died B-TER
during O
the O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

They O
just O
threw O
these O
people B-TER
out O
of O
line O
. O

Crematorium B-TER
was O
working O
day O
and O
night O
but O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
great O
number O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
. O

Later O
, O
I O
was O
singled O
out O
from O
block O
51 O
and O
got O
into O
the O
youthful O
block O
, O
no O
. O

66 O
. O

We O
did O
not O
work B-TER
either O
here O
but O
at O
least O
we O
did O
not O
need O
to O
leave O
the O
block O
but O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
inside O
. O

It O
was O
somewhat O
better O
here O
. O

Our O
leader O
was O
a O
Czech B-TER
who O
treated O
us O
so O
nicely O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
find O
the O
words O
to O
describe O
it O
. O

He O
treated O
us O
like O
a O
father O
his O
children O
. O

Although O
he O
was O
also O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
with O
limited O
opportunities O
, O
he O
still O
managed O
to O
obtain O
even O
food B-TER
for O
us O
. O

The O
English B-ORG
were O
already O
quite O
close O
when O
we O
were O
also O
taken O
away O
after O
8 O
weeks O
of O
stay O
. O

There O
were O
60,000 O
people B-TER
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
of O
very O
diverse O
nationalities O
, O
out O
of O
whom O
10,000 O
of O
us O
were O
Jews O
. O

I O
can O
not O
give O
dates O
, O
since O
we O
were O
not O
humans O
here O
, O
but O
lived O
like O
the O
most O
miserable O
beasts O
. O

In O
April O
, O
when O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
, O
English B-ORG
troops O
got O
closer O
, O
we O
left O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

They O
hurriedly O
entrained O
us O
in O
Weima B-LOC
r O
, O
putting O
100 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
car O
. O

Travelling O
for O
14 O
days O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
( O
since O
there O
was O
no O
place O
where O
they O
accepted O
us O
) O
, O
we O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
where O
Russians B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

My O
future O
plans O
? O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

First O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
there O
are O
surviving O
members O
of O
my O
family B-TER
, O
and O
will O
make O
plans O
only O
afterwards O
. O

The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
There O
were O
thirty O
Jewish O
families B-TER
living O
in O
Csepe B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
farmers O
, O
craftsmen O
, O
tradesmen O
; O
most O
of O
them O
lived O
in O
financially O
sound O
circumstances O
. O

We O
had O
land O
and O
we O
also O
lived O
in O
wealth O
. O

One O
day O
after O
Passover B-TER
the O
Jewish O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
village O
were O
driven O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
but O
we O
were O
sent O
home O
from O
there O
and O
we O
were O
told O
to O
collect O
our O
most O
necessary O
clothes B-TER
, O
underwear O
and O
food B-TER
, O
then O
we O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
barn O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

In O
Nagyszöllős B-LOC
we O
spent O
the O
first O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
where O
they O
deprived B-TER
us O
of O
all O
our O
more O
valuable O
belongings O
, O
then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
five O
weeks O
. O

József B-PER
Jarusil I-PER
, O
village O
notary B-TER
reported B-TER
against O
our O
father O
and O
based O
on O
that O
he O
was O
interned O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
as O
a O
communist B-TER
. O

He O
was O
locked O
up O
there O
for O
five O
weeks O
, O
during O
which O
time O
he O
was O
beaten B-TER
very O
much O
and O
a O
stripe O
had O
been O
cut O
in O
his O
hair O
already O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
set O
off O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
together O
with O
our O
father O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
know O
, O
nobody O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
those O
who O
died B-TER
, O
died B-TER
of O
natural O
causes O
, O
although O
they O
beat B-TER
us O
very O
cruelly O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
especially O
the O
wealthier O
people O
. O

The O
gendarmes B-TER
invented O
all O
sorts O
of O
tortures O
, O
they O
found O
fault O
with O
everything O
and O
they O
took O
every O
opportunity O
to O
treat O
us O
cruelly O
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
, O
on O
one O
occasion O
the O
men B-TER
tried O
to O
get O
some O
dry O
wood O
and O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
having O
noticed O
it O
, O
beat B-TER
them O
up O
brutally O
. O

They O
cut O
the O
hair O
of O
many O
girls B-TER
completely O
; O
the O
women B-TER
were O
stripped B-TER
naked I-TER
and O
men B-TER
bared O
their O
heads O
. O

They O
lined O
everybody O
up O
already O
on O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

We O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
look O
back O
; O
they O
threw O
stones O
at O
those O
who O
did O
. O

It O
was O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
who O
did O
all O
of O
this O
. O

They O
beat O
up O
even O
those O
who O
could O
not O
jump O
up O
from O
the O
stool O
when O
a O
gendarme B-TER
came O
by O
. O

No O
complaint O
was O
taken O
against O
the O
work O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
council I-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
a O
communal B-TER
kitchen I-TER
, O
but O
those O
who O
ran O
out O
of O
supplies O
were O
given O
uncooked O
food B-TER
. O

After O
five O
weeks O
we O
were O
always O
told O
that O
we O
would O
go O
to O
work B-TER
on O
Transdanubia B-LOC
, O
more O
precisely O
all O
the O
men B-TER
would O
. O

Before O
the O
deportation B-TER
they O
had O
taken O
away O
all O
our O
papers O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
they O
searched O
us O
and O
entrained O
us O
. O

They O
crammed O
80 O
people O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

They O
gave O
us O
some O
water O
and O
a O
bucket O
for O
a O
toilet O
too O
. O

Nobody O
died B-TER
in O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
and O
nobody O
escaped B-TER
from O
it O
either O
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
over O
us O
in O
Kassa B-LOC
we O
understood O
the O
situation O
already O
. O

After O
a O
three O
- O
day O
- O
long O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
7th O
May O
. O

We O
were O
still O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
when O
Polish B-TER
prisoners B-TER
dressed B-TER
in I-TER
striped I-TER
clothes I-TER
told O
us O
to O
get O
off O
and O
leave O
all O
our O
baggage O
there O
. O

After O
that O
they O
lined O
us O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
five O
and O
formed O
groups O
of O
us O
, O
one O
of O
which O
was O
sent B-TER
on O
the O
left O
, O
the O
other O
on O
the O
right O
hand O
side O
. O

They O
took O
us O
in O
the O
bathhouse O
and O
stripped O
us O
; O
they O
gave O
us O
grey O
prisoner‘s B-TER
clothes B-TER
and O
sent O
us O
to O
Camp B-TER
B. O
700 O
of O
us O
were O
put O
in O
a O
block O
, O
12 O
of O
us O
on O
a O
bunk B-TER
. O

Our O
provisions O
were O
the O
well O
- O
known O
camp B-TER
provisions B-TER
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
for O
hours O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
a O
warehouse O
of O
clothes B-TER
; O
we O
were O
the O
ones O
to O
dress O
the O
transports B-TER
. O

We O
took O
off O
the O
shoes O
of O
those O
who O
were O
selected B-TER
out O
from O
Camp B-TER
C I-TER
and O
if O
a O
person O
showed O
obstinacy O
or O
insisted O
on O
his O
shoes B-TER
very O
much O
we O
had O
to O
hit O
him O
, O
because O
if O
we O
did O
not O
, O
we O
were O
beaten O
up O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
day O
and O
night O
shifts O
; O
the O
transports B-TER
came O
to O
be O
dressed O
at O
night O
, O
but O
even O
from O
those O
transports B-TER
the O
weaker O
people O
were O
picked O
up O
and O
lined O
up O
naked O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O

There O
was O
a O
strict O
block O
curfew O
when O
the O
transports B-TER
were O
selected B-TER
; O
we O
had O
to O
switch O
off O
the O
light O
and O
trucks O
came O
from O
the O
crematorium B-TER
on O
which O
the O
naked O
people O
were O
put O
. O

We O
worked O
some O
metres O
away O
from O
the O
crematorium B-TER
; O
from O
there O
we O
saw O
as O
the O
trucks O
were O
turned O
over O
and O
people O
were O
spilt O
from O
them O
to O
the O
burning O
pit O
like O
bags O
of O
potatoes O
. O

We O
often O
heard O
shouting O
, O
crying O
and O
moaning O
especially O
at O
night O
, O
when O
the O
voices O
reached O
us O
more O
easily O
, O
but O
we O
also O
saw O
fires O
and O
flames O
frequently O
. O

When O
a O
transport B-TER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
arrived O
in O
September O
they O
took O
away O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
together O
. O

They O
led O
them O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
in O
groups O
of O
five O
. O

In O
September O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
traffic O
there O
anyway O
; O
transports B-TER
came O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
from O
other O
camps B-TER
too O
and O
those O
people O
were O
also O
quickly O
thrown O
into O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

There O
were O
transports B-TER
coming O
from O
Slovakia B-LOC
still O
in O
November O
; O
these O
were O
not O
killed B-TER
by O
gas B-TER
but O
the O
mothers B-TER
with O
their O
small O
children B-TER
were O
sent O
away O
and O
older O
boys O
and O
men B-TER
were O
assigned O
to O
do O
some O
work O
. O

In O
November O
, O
the O
crematorium B-TER
was O
dismantled O
; O
we O
also O
worked O
there O
for O
a O
week O
. O

They O
wanted O
every O
sign O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
to O
disappear O
: O
even O
the O
bricks O
were O
carried O
away O
. O

In O
December O
, O
we O
were O
put O
in O
a O
transport B-TER
as O
well O
and O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Hundsfeld B-LOC
near O
Brezlau B-LOC
. O

It O
took O
us O
one O
day O
to O
get O
there O
. O

We O
did O
somewhat O
better O
there O
, O
since O
it O
was O
a O
little O
camp B-TER
and O
the O
factory B-TER
provided O
us O
with O
food B-TER
, O
so O
the O
provisions B-TER
were O
naturally O
better O
. O

Although O
we O
stayed O
there O
only O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
, O
as O
the O
Russian B-ORG
troops I-ORG
were O
approaching O
, O
they O
formed O
a O
transport B-TER
from O
us O
again O
and O
sent O
us O
to O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
. O

The O
march B-TER
lasted O
for O
three O
days O
since O
it O
was O
January O
; O
there O
was O
a O
great O
snowstorm O
and O
it O
was O
terribly O
cold O
. O

We O
had O
to O
push O
big O
carts O
in O
which O
we O
were O
taking O
the O
belongings O
of O
the O
overseers B-TER
. O

One O
night O
we O
slept O
in O
a O
chamber O
; O
the O
ill B-TER
and O
weak O
people B-TER
were O
taken O
after O
us O
on O
trucks O
, O
but O
we O
heard O
that O
some O
of O
them O
were O
taken O
off O
the O
truck O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

They O
were O
buried O
right O
there O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

We O
had O
to O
help O
the O
ill B-TER
people O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
. O

We O
were O
very O
weak O
, O
we O
had O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
and O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
pull O
the O
carts O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
ill B-TER
people O
’s O
cart O
there O
, O
so O
we O
left O
the O
ill B-TER
and O
we O
were O
being O
chased O
along O
. O

We O
were O
so O
exhausted O
already O
that O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
go O
any O
further O
; O
we O
would O
not O
have O
minded O
if O
they O
had O
shot O
us O
dead O
immediately O
. O

At O
last O
they O
took O
pity O
on O
us O
and O
, O
since O
we O
were O
not O
far O
away O
from O
our O
destination O
, O
they O
had O
the O
carts O
pulled O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
by O
horses O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
women I-TER
shot B-TER
down I-TER
those O
women B-TER
who O
collapsed O
from O
weakness O
with O
bone O
chilling O
coolness O
. O

1,200 O
people O
started O
with O
the O
transport B-TER
, O
but O
by O
the O
time O
we O
arrived O
our O
number O
had O
been O
reduced O
to O
700 O
. O

The O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
camp B-TER
was O
only O
for O
men B-TER
; O
there O
we O
received O
clothes B-TER
and O
we O
had O
a O
rest O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
we O
continued O
our O
journey O
to O
Mauthausen B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
took O
us O
to O
a O
bath O
for O
men B-TER
, O
male O
prisoners B-TER
disinfected O
us O
, O
then O
we O
were O
given O
a O
pair O
of O
long O
underpants B-TER
and O
a O
shirt B-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
women B-TER
’s O
clothes B-TER
there O
. O

After O
three O
days O
we O
got O
our O
disinfected O
clothes B-TER
back O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
the O
Russians B-ORG
came O
closer O
and O
there O
was O
no O
time O
to O
give O
everybody O
her O
own O
clothes B-TER
. O

We O
picked O
up O
the O
clothes O
at O
random O
and O
so O
we O
ran O
away O
like O
that O
, O
dressed B-TER
improperly O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
ten O
days O
later O
. O

On O
the O
way O
we O
lived O
on O
a O
little O
amount O
of O
food B-TER
that O
we O
had O
managed O
to O
bring O
with O
us O
. O

Several O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
reached O
us O
on O
the O
way O
, O
but O
many O
of O
us O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
too O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
for O
three O
months O
. O

It O
was O
a O
collecting O
camp B-TER
and O
everybody O
was O
taken O
there O
from O
before O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

1,200 O
of O
us O
were O
crammed O
in O
a O
block O
. O

We O
slept B-TER
on O
the O
ground O
in O
filth O
and O
lice O
; O
we O
did O
not O
have O
blankets O
. O

We O
were O
given O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
twice O
a O
day O
and O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
bread B-TER
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

At O
the O
end O
we O
did O
not O
even O
see O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
weeks O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
the O
kitchen O
18 O
- O
20 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
so O
we O
sometimes O
managed O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
raw O
carrots B-TER
. O

The O
English B-ORG
troops I-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
15th O
April O
and O
soon O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
. O

They O
accommodated B-TER
us O
in O
a O
garrison O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

There O
we O
had O
a O
good O
place O
, O
nice O
treatment O
and O
proper O
provisions B-TER
. O

The O
ill B-TER
people O
received O
medical O
treatment O
. O

From O
there O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Celle B-LOC
, O
then O
with O
a O
Czech B-TER
transport O
we O
came O
home O
. O

Two O
men B-TER
were O
assigned O
to O
escort O
us O
in O
Pozsony B-LOC
, O
thus O
we O
came O
home O
through O
Komárom B-LOC
. O

Our O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
we O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine B-LOC
soon O
. O

The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Our O
father O
was O
a O
grain O
dealer O
. O

He O
had O
a O
house O
and O
we O
made O
a O
decent O
living O
from O
our O
income O
until O
around O
1943 O
, O
when O
the O
front O
was O
approaching O
our O
town O
. O

One O
year O
before O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
, O
Hungarian B-TER
soldiers B-TER
marching O
to O
the O
frontline O
came O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
street O
. O

They O
blocked O
a O
section O
of O
it O
and O
then O
entered O
each O
house O
. O

They O
were O
looting B-TER
and O
beating B-TER
up I-TER
women B-TER
and O
sometimes O
even O
children B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
they O
chased O
the O
people O
out O
of O
the O
houses O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
do O
punitive B-TER
exercises I-TER
on O
the O
street O
. O

Later O
it O
turned O
even O
worse O
, O
since O
they O
started O
firing O
and O
as O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
they O
even O
mounted O
a O
cannon O
in O
the O
street O
. O

A O
few O
people O
died B-TER
or O
were O
wounded O
in O
that O
incident O
. O

After O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
those O
kinds O
of O
acts O
became O
common O
occurrences O
and O
were O
institutionalised O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
looting B-TER
and O
searching O
for O
money O
and O
jewellery O
all O
the O
time O
. O

We O
were O
very O
scared O
. O

The O
mayor B-TER
was O
Engelbreckl B-PER
and O
we O
had O
no O
cause O
for O
complaint O
against O
him O
. O

However O
, O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
saw O
to O
it O
that O
all O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
decrees I-TER
were O
put O
into O
effect O
ruthlessly O
. O

One O
day O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
all O
the O
Jews O
in O
town O
should O
move B-TER
into O
streets O
designated O
for O
them O
by O
6 O
o’clock O
the O
following O
day O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
as O
many O
things O
as O
we O
could O
carry O
. O

However O
, O
two O
days O
later O
we O
had O
to O
move O
from O
the O
designated O
streets O
, O
since O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
been O
restricted O
to O
an O
even O
smaller O
area O
. O

Therefore O
we O
had O
to O
move O
into O
another O
street O
, O
but O
that O
time O
we O
were O
given O
only O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
move O
and O
we O
were O
supervised O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
never O
forgot O
to O
beat O
us O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
from O
Munkács B-LOC
remember O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Black O
Sabbath O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
going O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
that O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-TER
arrested B-TER
them O
on O
the O
way O
and O
said O
they O
would O
take O
them O
to O
work O
. O

Indeed O
, O
they O
took O
away O
ca O
. O

200 O
men B-TER
and O
made O
them O
remove O
the O
gates O
from O
the O
street O
- O
front O
and O
later O
rounded O
them O
up O
in O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
synagogue B-TER
and O
beat B-TER
them I-TER
up I-TER
severely O
. O

One O
of O
our O
uncles O
, O
Mendel B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
among O
them O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
beat B-TER
him I-TER
up I-TER
so O
badly O
that O
he O
was O
lying O
ill B-TER
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
forced O
the O
men B-TER
to O
bring O
out O
all O
the O
furnishings O
from O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

They O
even O
threw B-TER
out I-TER
the O
Torah B-TER
scrolls I-TER
and O
had O
the O
Jews O
wash O
the O
floor O
with O
their O
talliths O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
to O
a O
bloody O
pulp O
died B-TER
of O
their O
injuries O
. O

We O
had O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
, O
including O
Segelstein B-PER
and O
others O
. O

We O
had O
a O
soup B-TER
kitchen I-TER
, O
which O
provided O
the O
other O
ghetto B-TER
in O
the O
brickyard O
with O
food B-TER
as O
well O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fence O
and O
it O
was O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
move I-TER
from O
one O
ghetto B-TER
to O
the O
other O
; O
only O
a O
half O
hour O
was O
given O
a O
day O
to O
do O
that O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
guarded O
by O
military O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
who O
collected B-TER
jewellery O
, O
money O
and O
all O
the O
valuables O
they O
could O
find O
. O

The O
internal O
order O
was O
maintained O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
police I-TER
. O

We O
were O
staying O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

One O
morning O
at O
7 O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
broke O
the O
gates O
in O
with O
rifle O
butts O
, O
entered O
the O
flats O
and O
chased O
all O
of O
us O
out O
. O

They O
were O
virtually O
dragging O
people O
out O
of O
bed O
. O

Meanwhile O
they O
were O
beating B-TER
everybody O
mercilessly O
, O
including O
the O
children B-TER
. O

That O
was O
our O
most O
terrifying O
experience O
during O
our O
deportation B-TER
. O

The O
gendarmes B-TER
went O
from O
house O
to O
house O
joined O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
who O
were O
also O
beating O
us O
. O

They O
jointly O
rounded O
up O
everybody O
on O
the O
marketplace O
, O
lined O
us O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
five O
and O
we O
were O
set O
off O
for O
the O
brickyard O
. O

The O
cruelties B-TER
continued O
: O
those O
who O
could O
not O
keep O
pace O
were O
beaten O
to O
a O
pulp O
. O

Among O
many O
others O
, O
one O
of O
our O
relatives O
also O
died B-TER
during O
that O
trip O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
stroke B-TER
due O
to O
over O
- O
excitement O
. O

We O
stayed O
five O
more O
days O
in O
the O
brickyard O
ghetto B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
made O
the O
men B-TER
do O
punitive B-TER
exercises I-TER
and O
beat B-TER
them I-TER
up I-TER
once O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
locked O
up O
religious O
men B-TER
and O
forced B-TER
them I-TER
to I-TER
sign I-TER
a O
statement O
that O
read O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
the O
blood B-TER
of I-TER
a I-TER
Christian I-TER
girl I-TER
for O
the O
Passover B-TER
matzo O
. O

They O
beat O
the O
poor O
victims O
until O
they O
signed O
the O
statement O
. O

They O
took O
away O
the O
wealthy O
people O
and O
beat B-TER
them O
to O
a O
pulp O
as O
well O
. O

We O
had O
already O
packed O
up O
our O
luggage O
and O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
when O
they O
searched O
us O
once O
again O
. O

If O
they O
found O
money O
or O
any O
valuable O
item O
on O
someone O
, O
they O
beat B-TER
that O
person O
to O
death B-TER
. O

We O
remember O
an O
ethnic O
German B-TER
named O
Sefcsik B-PER
, O
who O
was O
especially O
cruel O
. O

Before O
our O
departure O
they O
rounded O
up O
the O
girls B-TER
and O
had O
them O
disassemble O
the O
empty O
barracks O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
refused O
to O
go O
were O
beaten O
up O
. O

We O
heard O
that O
we O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
work O
in O
Diósgyőr B-LOC
. O

Soon O
they O
entrained O
us O
. O

Seventy O
people O
were O
put O
into O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
, O
which O
was O
an O
ambulance O
car O
with O
15 O
people O
confined O
to O
a O
bed O
. O

Therefore O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
. O

The O
passengers O
included O
a O
one O
- O
day O
- O
old O
baby B-TER
, O
a O
little O
boy B-TER
in O
plaster O
to O
the O
waist O
and O
an O
insane B-TER
woman B-TER
as O
well O
as O
many O
patients O
from O
the O
hospital B-TER
and O
people O
from O
the O
home O
for O
the O
aged O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
imagine O
how O
terrible O
journey B-TER
we O
had O
. O

Surprisingly O
enough O
, O
nobody O
died B-TER
in O
our O
car O
. O

At O
departure O
we O
were O
given O
buckets O
for O
water O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
WC O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
had O
bread B-TER
put O
into O
the O
cars O
as O
well O
. O

There O
was O
another O
search O
for O
valuables B-TER
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
took O
over O
the O
train B-TER
there O
and O
then O
we O
went O
further O
at O
the O
speed O
of O
a O
fast O
train B-TER
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
May O
25 O
in O
the O
early O
morning O
. O

Polish B-TER
prisoners I-TER
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
assisted O
in O
detraining O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
behind O
our O
luggage O
. O

They O
lined O
up O
the O
men B-TER
and O
the O
women B-TER
separately O
. O

Then O
they O
divided O
the O
women B-TER
into O
two O
groups O
: O
some O
of O
us O
were O
sent B-TER
to O
the O
right O
and O
the O
others O
to O
the O
left O
. O

After O
that O
, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
bath O
where O
our O
heads O
were O
shaven O
and O
we O
got O
rags O
in O
return O
for O
our O
clothes B-TER
. O

Our O
better O
shoes B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
housed O
in O
camp B-TER
C. O
One O
thousand O
of O
us O
stayed B-TER
in O
one O
block O
and O
12 O
of O
us O
on O
one O
bunk O
. O

The O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
was O
at O
3 O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
then O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
which O
sometimes O
lasted O
as O
long O
as O
three O
or O
four O
hours O
. O

We O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
area O
until O
the O
numbers O
did O
not O
match O
. O

Afterwards O
we O
went O
to O
the O
block O
totally O
exhausted O
and O
we O
got O
some O
plain O
coffee B-TER
. O

We O
got O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
at O
noon O
in O
large O
pots O
. O

Spoons O
and O
plates O
were O
unknown O
there O
and O
therefore O
12 O
of O
us O
had O
to O
drink B-TER
from O
the O
same O
pot O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

We O
got O
bread B-TER
only O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Then O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
at O
least O
for O
two O
hours O
and O
the O
Zulage B-TER
was O
distributed O
only O
after O
that O
. O

Selections B-TER
began O
about O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
Berta B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
in O
August O
and O
I O
worked O
there O
until O
November O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
, O
but O
the O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
better O
there O
and O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

Later O
camp B-TER
C I-TER
was O
disbanded O
and O
so O
was O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

Then O
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
labourers B-TER
transport I-TER
in O
camp B-TER
D I-TER
. O

One O
thousand O
of O
us O
went O
out O
regularly O
to O
a O
workplace B-TER
that O
was O
eight O
kilometres O
away O
to O
perform O
earthwork O
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
; O
we O
worked B-TER
from O
7 O
am O
to O
3 O
pm O
. O

We O
got O
food B-TER
only O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
suffered O
a O
lot O
from O
the O
weather B-TER
. O

We O
often O
had O
to O
march O
and O
to O
work B-TER
in O
mud B-TER
and I-TER
rain I-TER
in O
our O
bad O
shoes B-TER
. O

We O
passed O
the O
crematorium B-TER
every O
day O
. O

In O
December O
we O
saw O
it O
being O
demolished O
. O

Meanwhile O
I O
got O
injured O
at O
work B-TER
: O
a O
tram O
hit O
my O
leg O
and O
I O
was O
lying B-TER
ill I-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

My O
leg O
still O
hurts O
. O

They O
set O
me O
off O
for O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
with O
a O
transport B-TER
on O
January O
1 O
. O

I O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
Jolán B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
selected B-TER
on O
September O
15 O
and O
taken O
to O
Weisswasser B-LOC
with O
a O
labourer B-TER
’s I-TER
transport I-TER
of O
300 O
. O

We O
were O
travelling O
for O
two O
days O
; O
55 O
of O
us O
were O
in O
a O
freight O
car O
. O

We O
got O
one O
third O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
Zulage O
for O
provisions O
as O
well O
as O
clean O
clothes B-TER
and O
better O
shoes B-TER
. O

In O
Weisswasser B-LOC
we O
stayed B-TER
in O
rooms O
: O
12 O
persons O
in O
each O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
an O
armament O
factory B-TER
; O
we O
went O
out O
to O
work B-TER
in O
groups O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
for O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

The O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
scarce O
and O
therefore O
we O
ate O
even O
potato B-TER
peels I-TER
and O
other O
vegetables B-TER
from O
the O
garbage O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
there O
until O
February O
2 O
, O
when O
we O
were O
set O
off O
on O
foot O
. O

After O
walking O
for O
two O
days O
, O
we O
were O
entrained B-TER
. O

Fifty O
of O
us O
were O
put O
into O
one O
car O
and O
taken O
to O
Horneburg B-LOC
on O
a O
five O
- O
day O
journey O
. O

We O
were O
given O
half O
a O
loaf B-TER
of I-TER
bread I-TER
and O
some O
Zulage B-TER
for O
provisions O
. O

Just O
like O
in O
Weisswasser B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
working B-TER
in O
an O
armament O
factory B-TER
for O
five O
weeks O
. O

However O
, O
we O
had O
a O
much O
stricter O
commander O
, O
an O
Unterscharführer B-TER
, O
who O
beat B-TER
us I-TER
severely O
for O
the O
slightest O
offence O
. O

Even O
very O
young O
girls B-TER
were O
sometimes O
sentenced O
for O
25 B-TER
strokes I-TER
. O

If O
we O
queued O
up O
for O
another O
helping O
of O
food B-TER
at O
lunch O
and O
he O
noticed O
that O
, O
he O
beat O
and O
kicked O
us O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
avoid O
him O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
being O
badly O
wounded O
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
transport B-TER
once O
again O
on O
April O
13 O
. O

After O
two O
days O
of O
travel O
we O
arrived O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

I O
met O
my O
sister B-TER
, O
Berta B-PER
Bleier I-PER
there O
two O
days O
before O
liberation B-TER
. O

She O
was O
working B-TER
hard O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
shortly O
after O
we O
met O
, O
she O
fell O
ill B-TER
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

The O
English B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
April O
15 O
, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TER
continued O
to O
operate O
afterwards O
. O

From O
there O
we O
went O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
and O
then O
to O
Zelle B-LOC
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
four O
weeks O
and O
after O
that O
we O
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
via O
Pilsen B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Our O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
as O
soon O
as O
our O
family B-TER
is O
reunited O
, O
which O
we O
hope O
for O
, O
we O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine B-LOC
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Jewish B-TER
laws I-TER
concerned O
me O
only O
in O
as O
much O
as O
my O
application O
was O
accepted O
only O
by O
the O
University B-TER
of O
Pécs B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
there O
I O
needed O
the O
support O
of O
someone O
to O
get O
in O
. O

At O
the O
university B-TER
, O
I O
witnessed O
some O
harassment O
, O
beatings B-TER
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Antisemitism B-TER
was O
intense O
at O
that O
time O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
I O
also O
received O
some O
beatings O
. O

Having O
done O
some O
lawyer B-TER
’s I-TER
practice I-TER
in O
Mohács B-LOC
and O
Pécs B-LOC
I O
came O
to O
Pest B-LOC
and O
found O
a O
job O
. O

Later O
, O
however O
, O
I O
obtained O
new O
training O
and O
worked O
for O
the O

factory B-TER
Star O

I O
had O
no O
problems O
here O
since O
I O
worked O
as O
a O

labourer O
. O

The O
15th O
of O
March O

, O
I O
left O

. O

, O
and O
later O
I O
worked O
as O
a O
draftsman O
for O
the O

. O

Here O
I O
had O
a O
good O
life O
till O
I O
was O
sent O
into O
Transylvania B-LOC
. O

In O
Dés B-LOC
, O
in O
Désakna B-LOC

from O
the O
Jewish O
Casino O
although O
I O
had O
a O

Here O
I O
had O
to O
stand O
40 O
minutes O
and O
he O
slapped O
me O

broke O

I O
made O
a O
great O
fuss O
about O
it O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
army B-TER
corps I-TER
headquarters I-TER
but O
in O
the O
meanwhile O
Germans B-TER
entered I-TER
the O
country O
and O
I O
had O
to O
withdraw O
the O
denunciation B-TER
. O

First O
, O
we O
worked B-TER
on O
railway O
construction O
for O
the O
railway O
co. O
, O
later O
we O
lay O
military O
cables O
in O
the O
ground O
between O
Óradna B-LOC
and O
Újradna B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
walk O
28 O
kilometres O
a O
day O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
the O
workplace B-TER
. O

We O
worked B-TER
only O
during O
the O
time O
that O
remained O
. O

Our O
correspondence O
( O
both O
incoming O
and O
outgoing O

was O
destroyed O
by O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
troop B-TER
, O
so O
we O
gathered O
torn O
pieces O
of O
letters B-TER
from O
the O
toilet O
. O

I O
had O
another O
incident O
with O
Cadet B-TER
Sergeant I-TER
Károly B-PER
Fejs I-PER
( O
from O
Szekszárd B-LOC
) O
who O
beat B-TER
me I-TER
and O
kicked O
my O
bottom O
because O
I O
went O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
food B-TER
. O

During O
the O
withdrawal O
from O
Transylvania B-LOC
we O
walked O
on O
foot O
from O
Újradna B-LOC
till O
Kassa B-LOC
without O
any O
food B-TER
. O

We O
got O
to O
Kassa B-LOC
the O
20th O
of O
December O
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
crammed O
in O
the O
brick O
factory B-TER
of O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
cold O
, O
we O
had O
no B-TER
food I-TER
and O
suffered O
greatly O
. O

We O
were O
nearly O
frozen B-TER
. O

The O
brick O
factory B-TER
of O
Kassa B-LOC
had O
a O
very O
bad O
reputation O
. O

7,000 O
people O
were O
kept O
there O
, O
out O
of O
whom O
many O
were O
frozen B-TER
and O
remained O
without O
food B-TER
. O

In O
December O
, O
they O
entrained B-TER
us O
, O
75 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
freight O
car O
, O
not O
more O
. O

We O
got O
food B-TER
once O
a O
day O
. O

One O
day O
we O
got O
lunch B-TER
, O
the O
other O
day O
dinner B-TER
, O
the O
next O
day O
breakfast B-TER
. O

We O
got O
no B-TER
water I-TER
at O
all O
and O
could O
not O
buy O
it O
either O
because O
the O
freight O
car O
was O
locked O
. O

It O
was O
full B-TER
of I-TER
lice I-TER
and O
people O
got O
sick B-TER
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

We O
had O
to O
use O
for O
the O
toilet O
either O
a O
great O
teapot O
or O
other O
pots O
. O

Signs O
of O
spotted B-TER
fever I-TER
could O
be O
noticed O
already O
on O
the O
train B-TER
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
there O
was O
a O
dead B-TER
person O
, O
the O
boy O
next O
to O
me O
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
9 O
days O
till O
Donnerskirchen B-LOC
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
2 O
am O
after O
9 O
days O
of O
travel O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
work O
already O
at O
6 O
am O
. O

We O
had O
to O
make B-TER
trenches I-TER
and O
bunkers O
, O
and O
had O
no O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
. O

We O
had O
no O
clothes B-TER
and O
some O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
barefoot O
. O

Here O
a O
sergeant O
forced O
me O
to O
get O
out O
into O
the O
snow O
having O
a O
temperature O
of O
40 O
degrees O
and O
he O
also O
broke B-TER
my O
cheek O
- O
bone O
with O
a O
club O
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
9 O
days O
before O
I O
escaped B-TER
with O
four O
of O
my O
friends O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
a O
service O
ticket O
which O
was O
forged O
. O

The O
7th O
of O
January O
, O
we O
crossed O
the O
German O
- O
Hungarian O
border O
and O
arrived O
in O
Sopron B-LOC
. O

From O
Sopron B-LOC
we O
went O
to O
Győr B-LOC
, O
where O
luckily O
we O
contracted O
typhus B-TER
, O
which O
meant O
5 O
weeks O
stay O
in O
hospital B-TER
, O
till O
the O
1st O
of O
March O
. O

The O
winter O
was O
then O
over O
and O
we O
had O
a O
good O
life O
in O
the O
public O
hospital B-TER
of O
Győr B-LOC
. O

Later O
, O
the O
1st O
of O
March O
, O
a O
1st O
lieutenant O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
ordered O
us O
to O
leave O
the O
hospital B-TER
and O
put O
us O
into O
the O
collecting O
place O
, O
the O
prisoner B-TER
s O
’ O
camp B-TER
of O
Győr B-LOC
, O
from O
where O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Schandorf B-LOC
. O

The O
sergeant O
who O
received O
us O
seized O
all O
the O
few O
things O
we O
had O
, O
he O
took O
even O
razors O
and O
soaps O
, O
etc O
. O

The O
20th O
of O
March O
, O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Szombathely B-LOC
, O
once O
again O
searched O
our O
luggage O
and O
robbed B-TER
us O
anew O
, O
leaving O
only O
a O
blanket O
. O

We O
then O
went O
to O
Schandorf B-LOC
on O
foot O
. O

Here O
we O
were O
crammed O
, O
750 O
of O
us O
, O
in O
a O
single O
cellar O
. O

In O
Schandorf B-LOC
we O
dug O
trenches O
and O
bunkers O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
from O
7 O
am O
till O
4 O
pm O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
were O
maltreated O
, O
beaten B-TER
, O
and O
struck O
. O

I O
left O
this O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
later O
I O
heard O
it O
became O
an O
unbearable O
place O
where O
they O
shot B-TER
people O
. O

Out O
of O
750 O
people O
, O
250 O
survived O
this O
camp B-TER
. O

Out O
of O
my O
team O
of O
40 O
people O
only O
8 O
survived O
. O

The O
rest O
all O
died B-TER
from O
typhus B-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
doctors B-TER
at O
all O
. O

They O
kept O
these O
people O
in O
a O
special O
ward O
of O
a O
hospital B-TER
but O
it O
practically O
meant O
a O
death B-TER
sentence O
. O

A O
veterinarian B-TER
treated O
them O
but O
had O
no O
medicine O
, O
and O
people O
died B-TER
of O
starvation B-TER
. O

Food B-TER
was O
anyway O
extremely O
scarce O
. O

We O
set O
off O
from O
Schandorf B-LOC
because O
of O
the O
Russian B-ORG
approach O
and O
walked B-TER
for O
16 O
days O
. O

We O
got O
food O
6 O
times O
during O
these O
16 O
days O
. O

The O
person O
who O
got O
tired O
or O
was O
out O
of O
step O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

They O
treated O
us O
in O
an O
incredible O
way O
. O

An O
average O
of O
40 O
people O
died B-TER
per O
day O
. O

The O
7th O
of O
April O
, O
in O
the O
forest O
at O
Eisenerz B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
metallurgical O
towns O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
killed B-TER
150 O
Jews O
with O
machine O
guns O
without O
any O
reason O
. O

About O
10 O
centimetres O
behind O
my O
back O
my O
friend O
was O
shot B-TER
, O
too O
, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
proceed O
, O
we O
could O
not O
stop O
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
got O
to O
Mauthausen B-LOC
. O

In O
Mauthausen B-LOC
we O
lived O
in O
tents B-TER
. O

After O
an O
air B-TER
raid I-TER
at O
night O
9 O
people O
remained O
dead B-TER
and O
20 O
were O
wounded O
. O

There O
was O
also O
another O
tragic O
event O
that O
affected O
my O
spirit O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

One O
of O
the O
supervisors B-TER
was O
beating O
a O
50 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
friend O
of O
mine O
badly O
when O
I O
jumped O
on O
him O
. O

He O
went O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
to O
complain O
about O
me O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
beat B-TER
me O
up O
so O
much O
that O
they O
broke O
my O
ribs O
and O
the O
bone O
of O
my O
little O
finger O
. O

Food B-TER
was O
terribly O
poor O
. O

For O
breakfast O
we O
got O
0.2 O
litre O
of O
bitter O
black O
coffee B-TER
, O
at O
noon O
some O
turnip O
soup B-TER
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
100 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

That O
was O
all O
for O
a O
day O
. O

It O
was O
only O
natural O
that O
we O
became O
feeble O
and O
many O
died B-TER
. O

Death B-TER
was O
caused O
by O
typhus B-TER
, O
by O
starvation B-TER
and O
beating B-TER
. O

From O
Mauthausen B-LOC
we O
went O
to O
Gunskirchen B-LOC
walking B-TER
for O
four O
days O
. O

We O
were O
starving B-TER
a O
lot O
on O
the O
way O
; O
we O
ate O
grass O
, O
nettles O
, O
and O
leaves O
. O

If O
they O
noticed O
that O
someone O
was O
out O
of O
step O
they O
shot B-TER
him O
, O
they O
shot B-TER
also O
those O
weak O
people O
who O
could O
not O
carry O
on O
walking B-TER
, O
so O
there O
were O
a O
great O
number O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
lying O
on O
the O
road O
. O

50 O
men O
were O
sent O
ahead O
to O
dig O
graves B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
an O
SS B-TER
soldier O
disliked O
the O
work O
of O
a O
gravedigger O
. O

He O
made O
him O
stand O
in O
the O
grave O
and O
beat O
him O
till O
he O
died B-TER
. O

One O
could O
see O
the O
inner O
parts O
of O
his O
skull O
, O
that O
is O
how O
much O
he O
beat O
him O
. O

It O
was O
a O
terrible O
view O
. O

The O
others O
then O
covered O
him O
with O
soil O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Gunskirchen B-LOC
we O
were O
put O
up O
in O
wooden O
huts O
. O

They O
crammed B-TER
2,000 O
people O
in O
a O
barrack B-TER
for O
500 O
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
cramped O
, O
could O
not O
lie O
down O
, O
and O
slept O
sitting O
on O
the O
rucksacks O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
learnt O
from O
the O
Americans B-ORG
that O
they O
found O
arsenic O
in O
dissected O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
. O

They O
put O
little O
portions O
into O
the O
food B-TER
that O
caused O
the O
general O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

If O
someone O
went O
to O
the O
toilet O
he O
could O
not O
get O
there O
because O
he O
was O
shot B-TER
by O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

We O
were O
very O
much O
full B-TER
of I-TER
lice I-TER
; O
there O
was O
no O
water O
to O
wash B-TER
, O
not O
even O
for O
drinking B-TER
. O

Sometimes O
we O
got O
a O
decilitre O
of O
water B-TER
and O
could O
decide O
to O
use O
it O
for O
drinking O
or O
for O
washing O
. O

Food B-TER
was O
turnip O
soup B-TER
all O
the O
time O
, O
and O
ca O
. O

70 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Here O
they O
did O
not O
beat O
us O
, O
they O
just O
simply O
shot B-TER
the O
people O
they O
disliked O
or O
against O
whom O
there O
were O
complaints O
. O

One O
day O
we O
were O
carrying O
the O
dead B-TER
. O

One O
of O
the O
boys O
ran O
out O
of O
energy O
and O
put O
the O
body O
down O
before O
it O
was O
allowed O
. O

He O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

Around O
150 O
- O
200 O
of O
us O
died B-TER
daily O
, O
completely O
feeble O
people O
who O
either O
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
or O
of O
typhus B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
bury O
them O
in O
a O
pit B-TER
. O

The O
Americans B-ORG
found O
this O
pit B-TER
; O
that O
was O
when O
they O
found O
out O
about O
arsenic O
poisoning O
. O

The O
Americans B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
the O
4th O
of O
May O
, O
1945 O
, O
and O
we O
started O
to O
do O
better O
. O

These O
were O
my O
own O
experiences O
. O

The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Before O
they O
entrained O
us O
and O
deported B-TER
us O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
we O
stayed O
for O
around O
five O
weeks O
in O
the O
brick O
factory O
of O
Munkács B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
station O
they O
separated O
us O
from O
our O
parents B-TER
, O
whom O
we O
never O
saw O
again O
. O

We O
went O
into O
Camp B-TER
A I-TER
, O
from O
where O
we O
were O
led O
to O
Brezinka B-TER
5 O
days O
later O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
here O
till O
December O
. O

Brezinka B-TER
was O
constructed O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
surrounded O
by O
5 O
crematoria B-TER
. O

We O
received O
and O
sorted O
out O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
and O
the O
luggage O
that O
deported B-TER
people O
had O
brought O
. O

We O
also O
found O
our O
own O
stuff O
, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
put O
on O
our O
sweaters B-TER
because O
we O
were O
very O
cold B-TER
. O

However O
, O
when O
they O
noticed O
it O
they O
gave O
us O
25 O
blows O
and O
seized O
all O
that O
we O
had O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
could O
save O
was O
a O
photo B-TER
of O
our O
father B-TER
that O
we O
found O
also O
in O
Brezinka B-TER
among O
the O
several O
thousands O
of O
other O
photos B-TER
. O

We O
hid O
it O
in O
our O
shoes B-TER
and O
that O
was O
how O
we O
kept O
it O
for O
a O
year O
, O
which O
was O
quite O
a O
thing O
because O
they O
searched O
us O
all O
the O
time O
and O
more O
than O
once O
they O
took O
our O
old O
clothes B-TER
and O
gave O
us O
new O
ones O
. O

We O
still O
have O
the O
photo B-TER
even O
if O
it O
is O
torn O
and O
tattered O
. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
memory O
that O
remained O
of O
our O
parents B-TER
. O

Day O
by O
day O
we O
saw O
the O
long O
queues O
that O
led O
to O
the O
crematoria B-TER
but O
we O
never O
saw O
anyone O
returning O
from O
there O
. O

Around O
half O
of O
the O
women B-TER
who O
had O
worked B-TER
for O
three O
months O
in O
Krakow B-LOC
and O
came O
back O
here O
were O
singled B-TER
out I-TER
although O
those O
were O
young O
and O
fit O
for O
work O
. O

Once O
every O
four O
weeks O
we O
had O
a O
day O
off O
, O
when O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
a O
concert O
. O

Jewish O
boys O
and O
girls O
had O
to O
play O
instruments O
, O
sing O
and O
dance O
while O
a O
few O
metres O
away O
endless O
queues O
of O
innocent O
people O
headed O
towards O
their O
horrible B-TER
end I-TER
. O

Yet O
, O
a O
boy O
could O
not O
speak O
with O
a O
girl O
because O
they O
would O
immediately O
send O
you O
to O
a O
punishment O
kommando B-TER
to O
shovel O
coal O
or O
do O
some O
other O
kind O
of O
difficult O
job O
. O

In O
December O
, O
when O
no O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
and O
when O
they O
made O
disappear O
all O
traces O
of O
this O
horrible O
extermination B-TER
of O
people O
, O
and O
burnt O
also O
the O
men O
whom O
they O
had O
forced O
to O
assist O
with O
burning O
, O
we O
were O
also O
transferred O
from O
this O
place O
to O
Reichenbach B-LOC
. O

We O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
radio O
factory O
Telefunken O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
supervised O
us O
but O
we O
had O
a O
relatively O
good O
life B-TER
. O

We O
got O
300 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
twice O
a O
day O
cooked O
warm O
food B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
till O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
, O
when O
they O
made O
us O
depart O
on O
foot O
, O
and O
we O
did O
around O
150 O
kilometres O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
time O
we O
got O
a O
kilo O
of O
bread B-TER
each O
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
for O
four O
days O
, O
and O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
in O
school O
buildings O
. O

There O
were O
1,000 O
of O
us O
, O
and O
we O
were O
always O
lodged O
in O
such O
a O
small O
place O
that O
we O
could O
hardly O
sit O
down O
, O
so O
every O
morning O
we O
stood O
up O
more O
tired O
and O
worn O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Trautenau B-LOC
, O
and O
spent O
there O
three O
days O
. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
any O
bread B-TER
only O
some O
warm O
water O
with O
a O
few O
potato B-TER
peels O
. O

They O
put O
us O
here O
in O
open O
wagons B-TER
and O
we O
travelled O
for O
7 O
days O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
rail O
system O
was O
bombed B-TER
at O
several O
points O
and O
we O
travelled O
back O
and O
forth O
; O
they O
did O
know O
where O
to O
go O
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
journey O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Bergen- B-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
and O
thought O
our O
journey O
had O
finally O
ended O
and O
we O
could O
have O
a O
rest O
at O
least O
for O
a O
night O
even O
if O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
receive O
us O
either O
here O
. O

The O
train B-TER
stood O
still O
24 O
hours O
before O
we O
departed O
again O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Porta B-LOC
and O
remained O
there O
. O

This O
was O
a O
new O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
got O
100 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
watery O
soup B-TER
a O
day O
but O
had O
to O
work O
12 O
hours O
without O
a O
break O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
an O
underground O
factory B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
cross O
a O
high O
hill O
to O
get O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Our O
wooden B-TER
clogs I-TER
were O
torn O
to O
pieces O
and O
we O
remained O
barefoot O
. O

Our O
weak O
bodies O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
steep O
slope O
. O

Girls O
fainted O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
girls O
who O
had O
earlier O
got O
on O
so O
well O
despite O
the O
scarcity O
. O

We O
got O
down O
into O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
which O
was O
not O
fully O
finished O
yet O
. O

Everything O
was O
perfectly O
new O
and O
shiny O
; O
but O
it O
was O
dark B-TER
and I-TER
airless I-TER
. O

The O
lack O
of O
sunshine O
and O
fresh O
air O
was O
horrible O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
we O
felt O
as O
though O
we O
would O
not O
get O
any O
fresh O
air O
and O
drown O
. O

5 O
weeks O
later O
, O
we O
left O
for O
Fallersleben B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
for O
2 O
days O
. O

We O
got O
not O
even O
a O
bite O
of O
food B-TER
or O
a O
drop B-TER
of I-TER
water I-TER
during O
these O
two O
days O
, O
and O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet B-TER
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
we O
arrived O
, O
we O
still O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
and O
we O
believed O
we O
were O
to O
starve B-TER
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
following O
day O
, O
finally O
we O
got O
some O
soup B-TER
and O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
for O
5 O
days O
before O
they O
newly O
entrained O
us O
and O
the O
next O
day O
we O
arrived O
in O
Salzwedel B-LOC
. O

The O
first O
day O
we O
got O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
the O
second O
day O
50 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
a O
plate O
of O
soup B-TER
. O

There O
were O
already O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
kept O
here O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
there O
were O
no O
places O
for O
us O
, O
not O
even O
a O
little O
straw O
, O
so O
we O
slept B-TER
on O
bare O
floor O
. O

In O
the O
last O
days O
we O
did O
not O
get O
bread B-TER
either O
here O
and O
we O
could O
not O
see O
any O
water B-TER
. O

We O
got O
only O
the O
usual O
dried O
potatoes B-TER
. O

The O
squalor B-TER
that O
was O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
is O
unimaginable O
. O

Germans B-TER
wanted O
to O
set O
fire O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
together O
with O
us O
but O
the O
ca O
. O

150 O
French B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
, O
who O
stayed O
here O
, O
saved B-TER
our I-TER
lives I-TER
with O
composure O
and O
courage O
. O

Our O
parents B-TER
, O
two O
younger O
brothers B-TER
, O
our O
elder O
brother B-TER
and O
elder O
sister B-TER
with O
her O
two O
little O
children B-TER
all O
died B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

All O
that O
we O
desire O
is O
to B-TER
get I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine I-TER
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
My O
father B-TER
was O
a O
joiner O
, O
he O
died O
8 O
years O
ago O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
, O
my O
older O
brother B-TER
, O
my O
younger O
brother B-TER
, O
and O
older O
sister B-TER
with O
her O
5 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son O
were O
deported B-TER
into O
Poland B-LOC
in O
1941 O
( O
the O
15th O
May O
) O
. O

When O
it O
happened O
I O
stayed O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
to O
arrange O
for O
the O
documents O
needed O
for O
citizenship B-TER
. O

Three O
months O
later O
my O
brother O
managed O
to O
come O
home O
after O
a O
trip O
full O
of O
hardship O
. O

Around O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
village O
were O
deported B-TER
this O
time O
, O
only O
the O
widows O
of O
soldiers O
and O
relatives O
of O
labour O
servicemen O
remained O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
forced O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
through O
the O
border O
at O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
. O

One O
time O
Hungarian B-TER
, O
another O
time O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
beat B-TER
them O
, O
elderly O
people O
were O
either O
shot B-TER
or O
thrown O
into O
the O
river O
Dnester B-LOC
. O

They O
shot B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
in O
front O
of O
my O
brother B-TER
who O
managed O
to O
come O
back O
from O
death B-TER
’s O
door O
. O

He O
was O
interned O
for O
a O
year O
till O
his O
documents O
arrived O
but O
after O
another O
year O
his O
fate O
was O
decided O
, O
whe O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
brought O
about O
another O
turn O
in O
the O
life O
of O
Jews O
. O

It O
was O
now O
that O
I O
got O
to O
Somogyvár B-LOC
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
’s I-TER
place O
. O

Naturally O
, O
everything O
started O
also O
here O
with O
wearing O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
. O

After O
a O
thorough O
search B-TER
on O
the O
18th O
of O
May O
we O
were O
carried O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
Tab B-LOC
travelling O
like O
a O
caravan O
of O
Gipsies B-TER
as O
we O
could O
carry O
along O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

Here O
they O
designated B-TER
only O
one O
street O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

This O
was O
enclosed O
, O
guarded O
by O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
inside O
and O
by O
military B-TER
gendarmes I-TER
outside O
. O

There O
were O
around O
200 O
Jewish O
families B-TER
crammed B-TER
here O
, O
20 O
- O
30 O
living O
in O
one O
room O
, O
we O
could O
hardly O
lie O
down O
. O

We O
also O
had O
a O
soup O
kitchen O
but O
who O
had O
some O
food O
supply O
preferred O
to O
cook O
at O
home O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
were O
Weisz B-PER
, O
Szirmai B-PER
, O
etc O
. O

; O
we O
had O
no O
complains O
about O
them O
. O

Till O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
everyone O
had O
to O
work B-TER
here O
, O
they O
took O
us O
for O
agricultural O
work O
, O
for O
construction O
works O
, O
we O
built O
a O
levente O
centre O
. O

The O
peasants B-TER
of O
Tab B-LOC
did O
not O
want O
the O
ghetto B-TER
to O
be O
built O
there O
, O
therefore O
, O
debates O
about O
the O
ghetto B-TER
lasted O
for O
long O
but O
the O
notary O
of O
the O
community O
, O
who O
was O
a O
notorious O
antisemite B-TER
, O
and O
had O
lot O
of O
land O
wanted O
free O
Jewish O
labour B-TER
force I-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
but O
also O
wanted O
to O
show O
off O
with O
the O
levente O
centre O
. O

We O
were O
distributed O
on O
different O
estates O
of O
the O
area O
, O
we O
worked B-TER
from O
Monday O
morning O
till O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
then O
we O
returned O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
by O
cars O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
but O
did O
not O
have O
a O
bad O
life O
as O
food B-TER
was O
very O
good O
in O
all O
manors O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we O
finished O
the O
work O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
estates O
Dr. B-PER
Gusztáv I-PER
Götzen I-PER
did O
not O
pay O
his O
Jewish O
labourers B-TER
. O

No O
one O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
recall O
the O
death B-TER
of O
anyone O
. O

The O
3rd O
of O
July O
, O
we O
received O
the O
order O
to O
pack O
and O
the O
day O
after O
we O
already O
set O
off O
. O

We O
could O
carry O
15 O
kilos O
of O
luggage O
. O

When O
we O
were O
searched B-TER
by O
Hungarian B-TER
soldiers O
and O
by O
gendarmes B-TER
we O
had O
to O
undress O
nude O
. O

My O
friend O
wanted O
to O
save O
a O
little O
jar O
of O
apricot B-TER
jam I-TER
for O
her O
daughter O
but O
the O
gendarme B-TER
performing O
the O
search O
noticed O
it O
and O
seized B-TER
it O
, O
together O
with O
a O
ball O
saying O
that O
his O
son O
would O
use O
it O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
searching O
us O
they O
entrained B-TER
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
the O
court O
of O
the O
army O
station O
in O
Kaposvár B-LOC
where O
ca O
. O

7,000 O
people O
were O
concentrated B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
for O
five O
days O
till O
we O
were O
entrained B-TER
, O
90 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
water O
at O
start O
but O
almost O
nothing O
on O
German B-TER
territories O
. O

We O
had O
a O
bucket O
for O
toilet O
in O
the O
car O
. O

Two O
old O
women B-TER
died B-TER
during O
the O
journey O
, O
we O
had O
their O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
in O
the O
car O
until O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
miracle O
that O
only O
two O
old O
women B-TER
died B-TER
since O
the O
heat O
was O
almost O
unbearable O
in O
the O
open O
wagons B-TER
. O

In O
Kassa B-LOC
gendarmes B-TER
got O
into O
the O
wagons O
and O
told O
us O
to O
have O
patience O
and O
not O
to O
commit O
suicide B-TER
, O
we O
would O
be O
carried O
into O
Germany B-TER
where O
we O
would O
live O
well O
, O
there O
were O
going O
to O
be O
cinemas O
and O
theatres O
there O
, O
we O
only O
needed O
to O
work O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
the O
third O
night O
, O
we O
almost O
respired O
with O
relief O
after O
this O
awful O
journey O
although O
we O
did O
not O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
next O
. O

Häftlings B-TER
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
came O
up O
in O
the O
wagons O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
get O
off O
and O
to O
leave O
all O
our O
stuff O
in O
the O
car O
. O

When O
we O
queued O
up O
five O
in O
each O
line O
the O
SS B-TER
selected B-TER
us O
. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
about O
I O
could O
not O
even O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
when O
they O
took O
me O
into O
the O
baths O
, O
cut O
my O
hair O
, O
depilated O
me O
, O
and O
put O
me O
under O
cold O
shower O
. O

We O
were O
so O
weary O
that O
I O
was O
close O
to O
feeling O
well O
after O
the O
shower O
and O
did O
not O
care O
about O
my O
hair O
any O
more O
. O

They O
took O
our O
clothes B-TER
and O
gave O
us O
instead O
blouses B-TER
and O
long B-TER
skirts I-TER
and O
put O
a O
cross O
in O
red O
ink O
on O
the O
back O
. O

If O
the O
blouse B-TER
was O
thin O
the O
ink O
filtered O
through O
and O
ate O
into O
the O
skin O
. O

After O
the O
bath O
, O
I O
got O
into O
lager B-TER
B I-TER
where O
we O
were O
800 O
of O
us O
divided O
in O
two O
barracks O
. O

There O
were O
not O
even O
berths O
here O
, O
we O
sat B-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
ground I-TER
cluttered O
up O
, O
lying O
was O
out O
of O
question O
of O
course O
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
this O
was O
the O
worst O
barrack O
, O
the O
rain B-TER
constantly I-TER
fell I-TER
in I-TER
. O

Apart O
for O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
, O
this O
was O
what O
filled O
our O
days O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
got O
black B-TER
coffee I-TER
, O
at O
8 O
am O
some O
grass O
- O
like O
soup B-TER
which O
I O
never O
tasted O
during O
the O
time O
I O
was O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
a O
little O
piece O
of O
bread O
and O
Zulag B-TER
. O

The O
7th O
of O
August O
, O
I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
a O
group O
meant O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Lichteanu B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
took O
us O
three O
days O
and O
we O
received O
sufficient O
bread B-TER
and O
sausage B-TER
for O
these O
days O
. O

We O
travelled O
60 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
car O
and O
when O
we O
arrived O
to O
Lichtenau B-LOC
I O
was O
very O
glad O
we O
got O
into O
a O
relatively O
clean O
camp B-TER
. O

Everyone O
had O
a O
place O
to O
sleep O
, O
a O
blanket B-TER
, O
and O
even O
a O
cup O
and O
a O
spoon O
, O
so O
we O
started O
to O
feel O
like O
civilised O
people O
again O
. O

Our O
job B-TER
was O
to O
fill O
18 O
kilos O
heavy O
grenades O
in O
the O
ammunition O
plant O
and O
to O
help O
entraining O
the O
goods O
. O

We O
had O
to O
prepare O
around O
2,000 O
- O
2,500 O
pieces O
a O
day O
rushed O
by O
the O
masters O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
8 O
hours O
a O
day O
but O
in O
some O
special O
fields O
people O
had O
to O
work B-TER
12 O
hours O
. O

Every O
three O
weeks O
we O
changed O
shift O
; O
there O
were O
morning O
, O
afternoon O
and O
night O
shifts O
. O

Some O
masters O
beat O
us O
but O
generally O
all O
rushed O
us O
shouting O
Los O
, O
los O
. O

In O
December O
, O
there O
was O
less O
work B-TER
to O
do O
as O
we O
ran O
out O
of O
raw O
material O
, O
hence O
we O
were O
sent O
for O
forest B-TER
work I-TER
. O

This O
was O
much O
worse O
, O
we O
walked O
to O
the O
mountains O
in O
knee O
- O
high O
snow O
to O
work O
with O
the O
pickaxe O
and O
it O
was O
often O
already O
10 O
pm O
when O
we O
got O
back O
to O
the O
lager O
. O

We O
walked O
15 O
kilometres O
far O
away O
in O
wooden O
slippers O
in O
which O
we O
hardly O
could O
walk O
. O

January O
the O
15th O
, O
we O
started O
working B-TER
again O
in O
the O
plant O
. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
about O
it O
as O
we O
stopped O
having O
cold O
even O
if O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
March O
, O
Americans B-ORG
were O
getting O
closer O
so O
they O
hurriedly O
put O
us O
on O
trains B-TER
, O
100 O
in O
each O
freight O
car O
, O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
each O
. O

We O
spent O
six O
days O
and O
nights O
in O
the O
cars O
, O
the O
officer O
who O
came O
with O
us O
could O
not O
decide O
where O
to O
land O
with O
us O
, O
till O
we O
arrived O
to O
Leipzig B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
got O
off O
and O
spent O
three O
weeks O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
. O

Americans B-ORG
got O
closer O
again O
, O
so O
we O
left O
Leipzig B-LOC
and O
walked O
three O
weeks O
by O
day O
and O
night O
. O

We O
slept O
on O
the O
fields O
in O
the O
open O
, O
in O
rain O
and O
cold O
, O
we O
got O
every O
second O
day O
some O
pieces O
of O
cooked O
potatoes B-TER
, O
the O
skilful O
could O
obtain O
some O
raw O
ones O
but O
most O
importantly O
we O
ate O
the O
sorrel B-TER
of O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
suffer O
even O
for O
the O
sorrel O
as O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
bitch I-TER
beat B-TER
us O
if O
she O
caught O
us O
. O

A O
day O
before O
the O
liberation B-TER
a O
little O
girl O
went O
into O
a O
peasant O
yard O
to O
have O
a O
rest O
in O
the O
pigpen O
and O
therefore O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
see O
bread B-TER
during O
these O
three O
weeks O
. O

Americans B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
the O
27th O
of O
April O
at O
Wurtzen B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
following O
three O
weeks O
and O
rejoiced O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
good O
food B-TER
so O
we O
made O
up O
for O
the O
hunger B-TER
we O
had O
before O
. O

Three O
weeks O
later O
the O
Russians B-ORG
, O
who O
arrived O
here O
later O
, O
entrained O
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
Sagan B-LOC
where O
we O
stayed O
in O
a O
tolerable O
camp B-TER
for O
seven O
weeks O
. O

The O
ill B-TER
were O
cured O
in O
hospital B-TER

We O
returned O
home O
via O
Nachod B-LOC
with O
a O
Czech B-TER

My O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
I O
started O
my O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
on O
May O
11 O
, O
1942 O
in O
Tápiósüly B-LOC
where O
we O
dug O
sewers O
standing O
in O
the O
chest O
- O
high O
water O
. O

Moreover O
after O
work O
we O
had O
exercise O
too O
. O

It O
was O
forbidden O
to O
have O
visiting O
family B-TER
members I-TER
and O
so O
was O
obtaining O
food B-TER
through O
them O
. O

If O
despite O
of O
this O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
some O
food B-TER
then O
Lieutenant B-TER
Kőszegi B-PER
punished O
us O
in O
the O
cruellest O
way O
: O
he O
compelled O
us O
to O
do O
exercise B-TER
and O
trussed B-TER
people O
up O
. O

Sergeant B-TER
Forgács B-PER
urged O
us O
to O
work B-TER
by O
shooting O
around O
our O
feet O
and O
hitting O
us O
with O
a O
rifle O
. O

butt O

From O
here O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Nagykáta B-LOC
where O
Lieutenant B-TER
Colonel I-TER
Muray B-PER
tortured B-TER
people O
and O
hit B-TER
us O
in O
the O
face O
because O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
was O
never O
sewn O
on O
our O
clothes B-TER
in O
a O
proper O
way O
. O

Fifty O
- O
five O
of O
us O
were O
crammed O
into O
a O
very O
small B-TER
room I-TER
; O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
even O
move O
. O

We O
could O
wash B-TER
ourselves I-TER
only O
in O
the O

We O
had O
a O

sergeant I-TER
( O

did O
not O
allow O

. O

From O
Nagykáta B-LOC
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Ukraine B-LOC

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O

, O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
soldiers I-TER

The O

all O
the O
time O
and O
told O

many O
times O
that O

he O
walked O
around O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Around O
the O
middle O
of O
June O
, O
1944 O
, O
two O
Slovakian B-TER
boys O
escaped B-TER
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC

submitted O
two O

were O
the O

authentic O
descriptions B-ORG

of O
Auschwitz B-LOC

Having O
transformed O
these O
minutes O
into O
a O
single O
document O
we O
translated O
it O

were O
ready O
by O
the O
17th O

but O
, O
to O
be O
more O
precise O
, O
we O
did O
not O
receive O
the O

of O

the O

: O
The O
minutes O
we O
sent O
out O
at O
the O
end O
of O
June O
did O
reach O
their O
destination O
. O

As O
a O
result O
Roosevelt B-PER
sent O
a O
memorial O
to O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
government B-TER
, O
demanding O
they O
made O
possible O
the O
emigration B-TER
of O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
a O
valid O
entry B-TER
permit I-TER
. O

This O
demand O
was O
answered O
by O
Prime B-PER
Minister I-PER
Sztójay I-PER
, O
who O
agreed O
to O
set O
up O
an O
office O
coordinating O
the O
process O
of O
emigration B-TER
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
. O

On O
the O
top O
of O
that O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
June O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
managed O
to O
make O
Ferenczy B-PER
believe O
what O
was O
indeed O
happening O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
achieved O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
meeting O
organised O
between O
Ferenczy B-PER
, O
his O
assistant O
Lullay B-PER
, O
Batiszfalvy B-PER
, O
Samu B-PER

Károly B-PER
Wilhelm I-PER
and O
Ernő B-PER
Pető I-PER
in O
the O
flat O
of O
Samu B-PER
Stern I-PER
. O

At O
this O
meeting O
they O
agreed O
that O
in O
case O
the O
Regent B-PER
( O
as O
the O
supreme O
commander O
) O
instructed O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
of O
the O
countryside O
to O
come O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
these O
would O
resist O
Germans B-TER
even O
if O
they O
used O
force O
to O
deport O
the O
Jews O
on O
the O
5th O
of O
July O
, O
which O
was O
the O
agreed O
date O
. O

That O
is O
what O
preceded O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
office O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
on O
the O
24th O
of O
July O
. O

Consul O
Lutz B-PER
requested O
that O
the O
office O
lay O
not O
far O
from O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
on O
Szabadság B-LOC
Square I-LOC
. O

We O
chose O
the O
office O
of O
the O
Weiss B-PER
company O
in O
29 O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

We O
made O
an O
appeal O
for O
this O
place O
in O
agreement O
with O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
, O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
the O
government O
. O

Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
asked O
us O
to O
set O
up O
the O
office O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
since O
the O
building O
would O
have O
been O
soon O
demanded O
also O
by O
his O
business O
rivals O
, O
and O
to O
preserve O
his O
dignity O
towards O
these O
rivals O
he O
also O
wanted O
to O
obtain O
a O
chief O
position O
there O
. O

Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
as O
the O
head O
of O
the O
office B-ORG
entrusted O
him O
to O
be O
the O
administrative O
head O
. O

The O
office B-ORG
opened O
the O
24th O
of O
July O
. O

The O
first O
days O
Ferenczy B-PER
and O
Batiszfalvy B-PER
came O
to O
control O
whether O
the O
office O
functioned O
according O
to O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
government B-TER
. O

The O
job O
of O
this O
office B-ORG
was O
to O
register O
everyone O
who O
applied O
for O
a O
permission O
to O
emigrate B-ORG
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Already O
in O
the O
first O
days O
, O
moreover O
, O
before O
the O
office B-ORG
was O
opened O
, O
we O
agreed O
in O
the O
emigration B-ORG
of O
several O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
scheduled O
for O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
, O
who O
were O
to O
be O
transported O
in O
groups O
of O
2,000 O
in O
personal O
vehicles O
, O
with O
collective O
passports B-TER
through O
Romania B-LOC
. O

Ferenczy B-PER
and O
Krausz B-PER
singled O
out O
the O
Palatinus O
- O
houses O
in O
Pozsonyi B-LOC
Road I-LOC
designated O
as O
a O
gathering O
place O
for O
the O
transports O
, O
from O
where O
they O
could O
collectively O
depart B-TER
. O

These O
were O
the O
seeds O
of O
what O
later O
became O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
. O

The O
office O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
was O
clearly O
a O
Zionist B-TER
institution O
or O
at O
least O
it O
started O
like O
that O
. O

We O
accepted O
the O
applications O
for O
passport B-TER
mostly O
from O
Zionists B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
August O
, O
the O
fist O
collective O
passport B-TER
was O
ready O
. O

It O
had O
two O
volumes O
. O

We O
immediately O
received O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
exit B-TER
permit I-TER
and O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
transit B-TER
permit I-TER
. O

They O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
us O
the O
German B-TER
exit B-TER
permit I-TER
though O
, O
because O
it O
was O
their O
goal O
to O
concentrate B-TER
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
Western O
part O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
after O
the O
first O
transit O
left O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
gave O
the O
permit O
in O
October O
, O
which O
was O
valid O
until O
the O
1st O
of O
January O
, O
1945 O
. O

This O
was O
what O
legally O
happened O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
it O
was O
already O
heavily O
criticised O
by O
the O
journals B-TER
, O
for O
example O
by O
Déli O
Magyar O
Szó O
Southern O
Hungarian O
Word O
, O
where O
attention O
was O
directed O
to O
our O
activity O
twice O
in O
August O
. O

It O
was O
however O
the O
most O
important O
to O
find O
a O
neutral O
place O
for O
illegal B-TER
activity I-TER
where O
there O
was O
no O
chance O
to O
be O
caught O
. O

The O
Embassy B-ORG
was O
an O
excellent O
place O
for O
that O
, O
which O
had O
naturally O
extraterritorial O
rights O
. O

Evidently O
, O
we O
moved O
our O
illegal B-TER
activity I-TER
already O
in O
the O
first O
days O
to O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

In O
part O
, O
this O
was O
the O
place O
where O
we O
produced O
and O
distributed O
documents B-TER
proving B-TER
Christianity B-TER
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
this O
was O
the O
place O
where O
we O
organised O
illegal O
emigrations B-TER
( O
tijul O
) O
into O
Romania B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

Our O
well O
organised O
smugglers B-TER
helped O
the O
way O
of O
several O
thousands O
of O
people O
from O
Szabadság B-LOC
Square I-LOC
to O
Arad B-LOC
, O
basically O
from O
house O
to O
house O
. O

I O
have O
to O
note O
that O
neither O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
nor O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
assisted O
our O
illegal B-TER
activities I-TER
, O
what O
is O
more O
, O
it O
happened O
also O
that O
they O
banned O
Rafi O
, O
Mimis O
, O
Pill O
and O
Efra O
to O
enter O
the O
building O
of O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

( O
Of O
course O
, O
they O
ignored O
it O
. O

) O
There O
was O
another O
important O
ongoing O
project O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

There O
were O
several O
Zionist B-TER
comrades O
kept O
in O
internment B-TER
camps I-TER
or O
jails B-TER
not O
so O
much O
because O
they O
were O
Jews O
but O
because O
of O
forging B-TER
documents I-TER
still O
in O
those O
times O
when O
masses O
of O
people O
crossed B-TER
the I-TER
borders I-TER
coming O
from O
Slovakia B-LOC
and O
other O
lands O
, O
and O
these O
people O
needed O
hiding B-TER
places O
. O

These O
people O
were O
freed O
using O
original O
American B-ORG
letters B-TER
of I-TER
protection I-TER
( O
which O
we O
stole O
, O
or O
rather O
I O
stole O
on O
Szabadság B-LOC
Square I-LOC
) O
. O

This O
is O
what O
preceded O
15th O
October O
. O

That O
morning O
we O
listened O
to O
Horthy B-PER
’s I-PER
proclamation O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
day O
after O
we O
entered O
the O
building O
knowing O
we O
would O
not O
leave O
the O
place O
till O
the O
rule O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
lasted O
. O

The O
first O
day O
there O
were O
only O
60 O
of O
us O
. O

The O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
, O
which O
was O
the O
authority O
above O
us O
, O
declared O
that O
officers O
of O
the O
institute O
together O
with O
their O
families B-TER
could O
stay O
in O
the O
building O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
urgency O
of O
the O
work O
to O
be O
done O
. O

Finally O
, O
by O
the O
day O
of O
the O
liberation B-TER
the O
number O
of O
people O
living O
in O
the O
building O
raised O
to O
2,750 O
. O

Jewish B-TER
houses I-TER
came O
to O
be O
closed O
down O
and O
people O
were O
taken B-TER
away I-TER
. O

As O
a O
reaction O
young O
Zionists B-TER
dressed O
in O
the O
uniform B-TER
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
started O
their O
mission O
from O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
brought B-TER
back I-TER
bunches O
of O
Jews O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

We O
were O
500 O
already O
the O
third O
day O
. O

Day O
by O
day O
it O
was O
more O
difficult O
to O
put O
up O
with O
the O
lessening B-TER
space I-TER
, O
the B-TER
lack I-TER
of I-TER
food I-TER
and O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
problems O
of O
sanitation B-TER
. O

Luckily O
, O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
was O
established O
in O
Mérleg B-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
August O
, O
where O
the O
head O
was O
Ottó B-PER
Komoly I-PER
, O
the O
administrators O
were O
our O
Zionist B-TER
comrades O
, O
like O
Efra O
, O
the O
head O
of O
finances O
, O
who O
helped O
us O
overcome O
problems O
of O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
till O
the O
time O
also O
the O
office O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
set O
up O
its O
own O
financial O
department O
and O
kitchen B-TER
, O
and O
became O
self O
- O
sufficient O
. O

The O
first B-TER
attack I-TER
from O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
occurred O
on O
the O
17th O
of O
October O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
inform O
immediately O
Vice B-TER
- I-TER
Consul I-TER
Steiner B-PER
, O
who O
thwarted O
the O
action O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
bandits O
. O

The O
20th O
of O
October O
, O
men B-TER
between O
the O
age O
of O
14 O
to O
60 O
were O
taken B-TER
away I-TER
, O
and O
women B-TER
were O
ordered O
to O
be O
called O
up O
for O
the O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
by O
the O
23rd O
. O

The O
indicated O
place O
was O
the O
sports O
grounds O
of O
the O
National O
Centre O
for O
High O
School O
Sports O
Clubs O
. O

We O
phrased O
the O
text O
of O
the O
Schutzpass B-TER
that O
day O
, O
we O
dated O
them O
to O
the O
23rd O
of O
October O
, O
copied O
them O
on O
16 O
typewriters O
by O
day O
and O
night O
, O
and O
started O
to O
distribute O
them O
to O
anyone O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
Jewish O
religion O
and O
made O
an O
appeal O
for O
them O
. O

Since O
there O
were O
no O
signatures O
on O
the O
Schutzpass B-TER
, O
we O
right O
away O
forged O
them O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
even O
among O
people O
who O
found O
asylum O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
there O
were O
some O
who O
sold O
these O
stolen O
copies O
Schutzpass B-TER
for O
money O
. O

Since O
the O
permission O
to O
emigrate B-TER
was O
given O
according O
to O
7,800 O
certificates O
the O
government O
insisted O
that O
only O
7,800 O
people O
could O
obtain O
copies O
Schutzpass B-TER
. O

This O
amount O
of O
people O
received O
their O
Schutzpass B-TER
basically O
already O
the O
first O
day O
, O
therefore O
our O
strategy O
was O
to O
declare O
that O
the O
7,800 O
certificates O
regarded O
7,800 O
families O
, O
which O
comprised O
at O
least O
60,000 O
people O
. O

When O
the O
sad B-TER
march I-TER
of O
deportees B-TER
was O
set O
off O
on O
the O
highway O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
we O
received O
neither O
cars O
nor O
officers O
from O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
to O
follow O
them O
and O
bring O
them O
back O
as O
the O
Swedish B-PER
had O
done O
. O

We O
bought O
a O
car O
pooling O
together O
the O
money O
, O
put O
a O
plate O
indicating O
diplomatic B-TER
affiliation O
on O
it O
and O
our O
Zionist B-TER
comrades O
went O
to O
the O
brick B-TER
factories I-TER
and O
everywhere O
until O
the O
border O
, O
Hegyeshalom B-LOC
, O
from O
where O
we O
had O
to O
bring B-TER
back I-TER
the O
people O
using O
the O
documents B-TER
we O
had O
produced O
. O

Men B-TER
were O
made O
to O
march B-TER
on O
foot O
close O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
and O
we O
had O
success O
in O
several O
cases O
in O
bringing O
them O
back O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
beginning O
of O
November O
they O
singled O
out O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
. O

At O
first O
, O
there O
were O
so O
few O
houses O
provided O
for O
the O
people O
protected O
by O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
that O
not O
even O
7,800 O
people O
had O
enough O
place O
. O

Later O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
get O
more O
houses B-TER
for O
this O
purpose O
using O
Ferenczy B-PER
’s I-PER
influence O
. O

Altogether O
we O
put O
accommodated B-TER
around O
35 O
- O
40,000 O
people O
in O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
. O

Meanwhile O
the O
government B-TER
kept O
asking O
for O
the O
list O
of O
the O
7,800 O
, O
and O
we O
were O
working O
on O
it O
. O

Meanwhile O
the O
Housing O
Offices O
in O
14 B-LOC
SzentIstván I-LOC
Park I-LOC
and O
32 B-LOC
Pozsonyi I-LOC
Road I-LOC
were O
set O
up O
. O

The O
former O
was O
headed O
by O
professor O
Waldapfel B-PER
, O
the O
latter O
by O
Márton B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
. O

Still O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
November O
, O
when O
circumstances O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
became O
almost O
unbearable O
, O
Dr. B-PER
Rezső I-PER
Mezei I-PER
decided O
that O
the O
place O
was O
not O
secure O
enough O
for O
him O
and O
his O
family B-TER
any O
longer O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
open O
another O
subordinate O
office O
, O
and O
received O
the O
permission O
of O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
to O
do O
so O
. O

Mezei B-PER
had O
been O
an O
officer O
of O
a O
bank O
and O
got O
into O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
only O
as O
a O
friend O
of O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
. O

His O
only O
merit O
was O
that O
his O
great O
loquacity O
saved O
the O
situation O
when O
men O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
attacked B-TER
us O
the O
17th O
of O
October O
. O

This O
is O
why O
the O
15th O
of O
November O
the O
office O
in O
Wekerle B-LOC
Sándor I-LOC
Street I-LOC
opened O
, O
where O
the O
so O
- O
called O
elite O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
capitalists O
lived O
in O
apparent O
security O
. O

It O
is O
part O
of O
Mezei B-PER
’s I-PER
story O
that O
he O
managed O
to O
save B-TER
around O
500 O
people O
living O
there O
. O

Although O
the O
office O
in O
Wekerle B-LOC
Sándor I-LOC
Street I-LOC
had O
no O
extraterritorial O
status O
he O
succeeded O
by O
using O
money O
and O
his O
suspicious O
connections O
. O

The O
23rd O
of O
November O
, O
5’o O
clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
gendarmes B-TER
woke O
us O
up O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
, O
who O
went O
through O
obvious O
changes O
under O
the O
heavy O
responsibilities O
he O
had O
, O
reacted O
in O
the O
most O
spirited O
way O
. O

I O
witnessed O
when O
he O
told O
the O
head O
of O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
a O
lieutenant O
, O
the O
following O
: O
You O
’d O
better O
clear O
the O
house O
of O
the O
gendarmes O
in O
three O
minutes O
, O
otherwise O
unforeseeable O
consequences O
would O
follow O
this O
atrocity O
, O
since O
gendarmes O
seriously O
offended O
the O
rights O
of O
extraterritoriality O
. O

As O
a O
result O
gendarmes B-TER
indeed O
left O
the O
house O
without O
proceeding O
with O
their O
search O
for O
weapons O
. O

After O
this O
event O
the O
2,500 O
- O
2,700 O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
house O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
enjoyed O
relative O
tranquillity O
if O
one O
disregards O
the O
identity O
checks O
done O
by O
detectives O
at O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
house O
for O
days O
on O
, O
or O
those O
masses O
that O
were O
arrested O
by O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
, O
while O
waiting O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house O
to O
apply O
for O
a O
Schutzpass B-TER
. O

Cellars O
, O
attics O
, O
and O
stores O
were O
all O
full B-TER
of I-TER
people I-TER
. O

As O
a O
result O
sanitation B-TER
got O
worse O
day O
after O
day O
, O
lice B-TER
started O
to O
spread O
, O
therefore O
we O
needed O
to O
move O
a O
part O
of O
the O
people O
into O
the O
neighbouring O
headquarter O
of O
the O
Hungarian O
Football O
Association O
. O

We O
resolved O
this O
question O
by O
breaking O
through O
the O
wall O
between O
the O
two O
buildings O
, O
blocking O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Football O
Association O
opening O
to O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
hence O
, O
the O
two O
buildings O
looked O
as O
if O
they O
were O
one O
, O
and O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
did O
never O
learn O
who O
stayed O
in O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Football O
Association O
. O

Until O
the O
31st O
of O
December O
– O
although O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
perform O
work O
regularly O
any O
more O
– O
we O
provided O
the O
food B-TER
supplies I-TER
of O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
from O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

We O
set O
up O
a O
hospital B-TER
in O
Tátra B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
provided O
it O
medicine B-TER
and O
lint O
. O

We O
were O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
the O
liberation B-TER
. O

December O
the O
31st O
, O
around O
2:30 O
pm O
, O
we O
heard O
gunfire O
from O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
courtyard O
. O

First O
we O
thought O
this O
came O
from O
airplanes B-TER
that O
had O
machineguns O
on O
board O
but O
we O
realise O
this O
was O
untrue O
when O
we O
heard O
swears O
against O
Jews O
and O
obscene O
words O
coming O
from O
the O
street O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
9 O
young O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
broke B-TER
in O
through O
the O
gates O
leading O
to O
the O
courtyard O
. O

Led O
by O
brother O
Balog O
they O
first O
fired O
a O
serious O
of O
shots B-TER
into O
the O
cellar O
which O
was O
used O
as O
an O
air B-TER
- I-TER
raid I-TER
shelter O
, O
where O
there O
were O
around O
1,000 O
of O
us O
in O
dark O
. O

They O
also O
threw B-TER
a I-TER
grenade I-TER
into O
the O
same O
cellar O
, O
and O
another O
one O
into O
the O
courtyard O
where O
the O
latrines O
were O
, O
which O
were O
naturally O
always O
surrounded O
by O
a O
great O
number O
of O
people O
. O

They O
broke B-TER
into I-TER
the O
house O
and O
forced O
some O
1,500 O
people O
to O
get O
out O
to O
the O
street O
. O

They O
did O
not O
find O
however O
either O
the O
correctly O
disguised O
entry O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Somér B-TER
cellar O
or O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
Mizrahi B-TER
attic O
or O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
Football O
Association O
. O

During O
this O
time O
Arthur B-PER
Weisz I-PER
, O
having O
bronchitis B-TER
lay O
in O
bed O
in O
the O
flat O
of O
his O
parents O
, O
where O
he O
was O
continuously O
on O
the O
phone O
, O
calling O
Szabadság B-LOC
Square I-LOC
, O
city O
military B-TER
headquarters O
, O
the O
headquarters O
of O
the O
police B-TER
, O
and O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
Foreign I-TER
Affairs I-TER
. O

We O
called O
the O
same O
organisations O
from O
the O
so O
- O
called O
council O
hall O
, O
where O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
entered O
only O
at O
the O
end O
. O

By O
this O
time O
, O
I O
already O
had O
a O
document O
certifying O
our O
extraterritorial O
rights O
signed O
by O
a O
German B-TER
commanding B-ORG
general I-ORG
. O

In O
the O
garage O
of O
the O
Glass B-LOC
House I-LOC
there O
was O
a O
guard O
made O
up O
of O
officer O
candidates O
with O
high O
school O
degree O
who O
took O
part O
in O
the O
resistance B-TER
movement O
because O
this O
was O
the O
place O
where O
the O
cars O
of O
the O
Romanian O
Department O
of O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
were O
parked O
. O

However O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
neither O
this O
guard O
nor O
the O
police B-TER
patrolling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
building O
hindered O
the O
break O
- O
in O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
to O
the O
slightest O
extent O
. O

We O
were O
staying O
there O
in O
the O
street O
and O
knew O
our O
way O
would O
lead O
directly O
into B-TER
the I-TER
Danube I-TER
. O

Now O
, O
Arthur B-PER
Weisz I-PER
showed O
the O
most O
remarkable O
example O
of O
courageous O
behaviour O
. O

Although O
his O
wife B-TER
, O
his O
son B-TER
, O
and O
his O
two O
old O
parents B-TER
were O
also O
in O
the O
street O
, O
he O
did O
not O
get O
frightened O
even O
for O
a O
second O
, O
and O
while O
he O
had O
a O
gun O
pushed O
against O
his O
chest O
he O
told O
them O
to O
calm O
down O
and O
forcefully O
that O
the O
building O
belonged O
to O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
, O
and O
these O
people O
were O
officers O
and O
their O
relatives O
protected O
by O
the O
Swiss B-ORG

and O
if O
they O
treated O
us O
like O
that O
Hungarian B-TER

would O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
way O
in O

. O

Here O
I O
have O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
minute O
to O
explain O
that O
regarding O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
we O
made O
contacts O
with O
two O
members O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
called O
Medgyesi B-PER
and O
Bodor B-PER
, O
furthermore O
with O

chief O
Tarpataky B-PER
, O
who O
made O
some O
concessions O
to O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
in O
return O
for O
bribery B-TER
. O

Bodor B-PER
was O
in O
particular O
benign O
with O
us O
. O

When O
he O
was O
informed O
about O
the O
atrocity O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
, O
he O
came O
to O
our O
place O
immediately O
and O
started O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
in O
front O
of O
our O
lines O
with O
an O
automatic O
machinegun O
, O
ensuring O
us O
that O
nothing O
bad O
would O
happen O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
backing O
arrived O
and O
we O
could O
return O
to O
the O

. O

The O
Arrow B-ORG

shooting O
led O
to O
the O
death B-TER
of O
four O

The O
next O
after O
, O
around O
1:30 O

the O
well O
known O

Balog O
appeared O
, O
who O
showed O
us O
at O
the O

an O

, O
which O
obliged O

to O
hand O
over O

for O
50 O
people O
for O
three O

. O

Arthur B-PER
Weisz I-PER
called O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
, O
who O
told O
him O
to O
give O
them O
the O
desired O
goods O
. O

We O
gave O
them O
50 B-TER
loaves I-TER
, I-TER
35 I-TER
cans I-TER
, I-TER
and I-TER
7 I-TER

of I-TER

. O

I O
was O
standing O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
Balog O
remained O
outside O
, O
and O
next O
to O
me O
there O
was O
Arthur B-PER
Weisz I-PER
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
Lieutenant B-TER
László B-PER
Fábry I-PER
turned O
up O
, O
who O
was O
the O
head O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
VÁP O
- O
team O
in O
charge O
of O
protecting O
Wekerle B-LOC
Sándor I-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
started O
to O
talk O
with O
Arthur B-PER
Weisz I-PER
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
about O
as O
I O
was O
engaged O
in O
counting O
the O
loaves B-TER
and I-TER
the I-TER
cans I-TER
. O

What O
attracted O
my O
attention O
was O
Fábry B-PER
telling O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
: O
Take O
it O
easy O
and O
come O
with O
me O
Mr. O
Weiss O
, O
to O
what O
I O
reacted O
in O
Hebrew O
telling O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
not O
to O
go O
. O

He O
made O
a O
gesture O
in O
an O
offhand O
manner O
. O

Fábry B-PER
then O
put O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
in O
his O
car O
, O
while O
Balog O
left O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

He O
came O
back O
in O
10 O
minutes O
claiming O
that O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
would O
be O
back O
by O
5 O
pm O
giving O
his O
word O
of O
honour O
as O
an O
officer B-TER
of O
the O
army B-TER
. O

As O
we O
found O
out O
later O
, O
he O
gave O
Weiss B-PER
to O
Balog O
who O
took O
him O
to O
14 B-LOC
Városház I-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
from O
there O
presumably B-TER
into I-TER
the I-TER
Danube B-LOC
. O

When O
Fábry B-PER
went O
to O
fetch O
him O
in O
Városház B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
as O
he O
claimed O
to O
have O
done O
, O
he O
was O
told O
that O
Artur B-PER
Weiss I-PER
had O
been O
already O
let O
go O
. O

This O
increased O
panic O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
day O
by O
day O
, O
which O
culminated O
after O
two O
days O
only O
to O
fade O
away O
completely O
when O
the O
new O
anxieties O
of O
the O
siege B-TER
took O
its O
place O
. O

Further O
on O
, O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
came O
to O
us O
maybe O
two O
other O
times O
to O
fetch B-TER
food B-TER
, O
but O
started O
shouting O
already O
at O
the O
gate O
that O
no O
Jews O
would O
be O
hurt O
, O
they O
only O
wanted O
to O
get O
food B-TER
. O

Naturally O
, O
we O
showed O
no O
reluctance O
as O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
get O
hurt O
. O

The O
6th O
of O
January O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
Jenő B-PER
Fränkl I-PER
sent O
a O
courier O
out O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
whose O
identity O
was O
checked O
by O
the O

of O

Pálóczy B-PER
, O
once O
an O
actor O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O

. O

During O
the O
identity O
check O
the O
boy O
was O
shouting O
that O
he O
just O
came O
out O
of O
the O
building O
of O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
that O
he O
was O
a O
courier O
. O

In O
this O
minute O
the O
car O
of O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
stopped O
and O
officers O
Andor B-PER
Gedeon I-PER
and O
Tibor B-PER
Szemere I-PER
jumped O
out O
. O

Comrade B-TER
Szimcha B-PER
Hunwald I-PER
, O
whose O
pseudonym O
as O
an O
officer O
of O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
was O
János B-PER
Kühne I-PER
stayed O
in O
the O

. O

Gedeon B-PER
entered O
the O
gate O
, O
the O
same O
second O
Szemere B-PER
noticed O
that O
the O
courier O
was O
running O
towards O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
. O

There O
was O
a O
shot O
and O
the O
cry O
I O
am O
shot O
, O
and O
the O
boy O
fell O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
Szemere B-PER
. O

The O
detective O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
was O
already O
at O
the O
car O
– O
the O
driver O
could O
just O
get O
out O
in O
time O
– O
and O
took O
Kühne B-PER
and O
Szemere B-PER
with O
himself O
to O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters O
, O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
who O
put O
them O
into O
the O
cellar O
of O
the O
royal O
palace O
. O

Thanks O
to O
his O
language O
knowledge O
Tibor B-PER
Szemere I-PER
was O
occupied O
as O
a O
translator O
and O
got O
freed O
when O
the O

was O
liberated B-TER
after O
40 O
days O
of O

, O
while O
Szimcha B-PER
Hunwald I-PER
was O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
basement O
of O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
. O

Naturally O
, O
this O
case O
generated O
panic O
again O
in O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
more O

in O
the O

in O

in O
the O

There O
was O
one O

when O

was O
shot B-TER
during O
the O

he O
did O
for O

The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
October O
, O
1944 O
, O
I O
worked O
for O
Department B-ORG
A I-ORG
, O
that O
is O
, O
for O
children B-TER
’s O
department O
of O
the O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
with O
its O
head O
office O
in O
4 B-LOC
Mérleg I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

My O
job O
was O
to O
administer O
less O
and O
more O
dangerous O
projects O
. O

As O
during O
this O
period O
call B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
placards I-TER
were O
placed O
practically O
every O
hour O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
houses O
of O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
because O
( O
understandably O
) O
basically O
no O
one O
felt O
like O
being O
called B-TER
up I-TER
it O
was O
a O
part O
of O
our O
activity O
to O
produce O
forged B-TER
documents I-TER
including O
different O
kinds O
of O
baptismal O
certificates O
, O
exemption O
letters O
given O
by O
ammunition O
plants O
and O
by O
other O
organisations O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
practice O
we O
were O
manufacturing B-TER
these O
documents O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
and O
distributed B-TER
them O
to O
people O
of O
all O
social O
layers O
, O
ranks O
and O
religions O
. O

From O
the O
office O
we O
went O
to O
brick B-TER
factories I-TER
and O
to O
other O
places O
where O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
concentrated B-TER
masses O
of O
Jews O
. O

Several O
times O
also O
György B-PER
Aczél I-PER
participated O
in O
these O
rescue B-TER
actions O
( O
he O
is O
now O
the O
local O
leader O
of O
the O
Communist B-TER
Party I-TER
in O
the O
5th B-LOC
district I-LOC
) O
, O
and O
in O
several O
cases O
we O
managed O
to O
free B-TER
the O
unfortunate O
Jews O
, O
especially O
women B-TER
staying O
in O
the O
brick B-TER
factory I-TER
. O

Later O
, O

a O

for O
the O
part O
of O

who O
were O
brought O
to O

or O
were O
often O
just O
dropped O
in O

of O
the O

. O

People O
, O
Christians O
also O
kept O
on O
notifying O
us O
about O
children B-TER
whose O
relatives O
had O
been O
taken O
away O
by O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
and O
now O
stayed O
in O
abandoned O
flats O
lacking O
any O
supervision O
. O

Most O
of O
our O
energies O
were O
spent O
on O
collecting O
these O
Jewish O
orphans B-TER
from O
the O
furthest O
points O
of O
the O
city O
, O
from O
the O
suburbs O
, O
from O
Angyalföld B-LOC
, O
etc O
. O

I O
remember O
a O
case O
when O
in O
Bulcsu B-LOC
Street I-LOC
we O
collected O
a O
large O
number O
of O
abandoned O
children B-TER
and O
brought O
them O
to O
the O
office O
by O
car O
. O

We O
had O
so O
much O
work O
to O
do O
that O
we O
could O
hardly O
cope O
with O
it O
. O

We O
collected O
the O
children B-TER
with O
the O
escort O
of O
the O
police B-TER
. O

Soon O
we O
had O
to O
provide O
their O
accommodation B-TER
. O

We O
established O
a O
gathering O
and O
selecting O
office O
in O
4 B-LOC
Perczel I-LOC
Mór I-LOC
Street I-LOC
where O
we O
took O
the O
children B-TER
escorted O
by O
the O

to O
distributed O
them O
among O
the O
different O
orphanages B-TER
that O
we O
set O
up O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

We O
were O
bringing O
and O
carrying O
children B-TER
with O
no O
end O
. O

Later O
, O
we O
received O
the O
building O
in O
16 B-LOC
Teleki I-LOC
Pál I-LOC

, O
where O
we O
gathered O
around O
1,000 O

. O

There O
were O
other O

in O
76 B-LOC

and O
at O

of O
the O

When O
the O

of O

were O
put O
into O
the O

our O

became O

more O

The O

was O
practically O
attacked O
by O

. O

Reports O
about O
abandoned O

got O
more O
frequent O
. O

As O
it O
is O
well O
known O
, O
they O
published O
a O
decree O
that O
all O
Jews O
– O
including O
the O
children B-TER
of O

– O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O

managed O
to O
get O
a O
six- O
day O

regarding O
the O

of O
the O

, O
and O
added O
to O
it O
another O
6 O

, O
finally O
further O
12 O

. O

Orphanages B-TER
functioned O
relatively O
well O

In O
the O

Also O
on O
a O

When O
we O
returned O
to O
the O

with O

Weyermann B-PER
we O
found O
a O
horrifying O
scene O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
one O
of O

two O

We O

We O
managed O
to O
save O

In O
another O
case O
, O
before O
this O

happened O
, O
the O
Arrow B-ORG

took O
children B-TER
away O
, O
claiming O
they O
were O
going O
to O
take O
them O

, O
but O
instead O
, O
they O
took O

When O
we O

we O

there O
and O

the O

We O

Children B-TER
in O
the O

lived O
in O
terrible O

. O

We O
tried O
to O
smuggle B-TER

as O
many O
as O
possible O
but O
also O
those O
who O
remained O

on O

between O

. O

January O
the O
first O
, O
we O
were O
sitting O
together O
in O
the O

of O

, O
when O
four O
men O
with O
signs B-ORG
of I-ORG

came O
to O
us O
and O
grabbed O
Ottó B-PER

giving O
their O
word O
of O
honour O
that O
it O
was O
only O
about O
an O

and O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
bring O
him O

in O

When O
the O

ghetto B-TER
was O
established O
the O
current O
ministerial O
secretary O
Dr B-PER
György I-PER
Gergely I-PER
initiated O

into O

the O

using O
forged O

. O

We O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
was O
also O
a O
diplomatic B-TER
institution O
, O
and O
as O
such O
we O
could O
protect B-TER
the O
inhabitants O
of O
these O
houses O
like O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
, O
the O
Swedish B-LOC
, O
the O
Portuguese B-LOC
, O
the O
Spanish B-LOC
, O
or O
the O

protected O

. O

There O
were O
around O
1,500 O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
put O
up O
in O
these O
houses O
, O
who O
we O
gave O

. O

These O
protected O
people O
were O
not O
touched O
nor O
molested O
by O

they O
had O

I O

in O

The O

an O

group O
entered O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
as O
they O
said O
to O
control O
Schutzpasses O
. O

Naturally O
, O
they O
did O
not O
find O
them O
acceptable O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
with O
the O
identity O
check O
. O

They O
gathered O
us O
in O
a O
room O
and O
selected O
and O
separated O
36 O
of O
us O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
older O
than O
70 O
in O
this O
selected O
group O
, O
while O
there O
were O
some O
severely O
sick B-TER
people O
among O
them O
, O
like O
someone O
with O
advanced O
cancer B-TER
. O

I O
asked O
for O
permission O
to O
go O
up O
to O
my O
room O
for O
my O
stuff O
, O
but O
they O
let O
me O
go O
only O
with O
an O
escort O
. O

As O
I O
later O
learnt O
, O
it O
was O
3 O
am O
when O
we O
departed O
among O
falling B-TER
bombs I-TER
and O
shells O
with O
the O
alleged O
reason O
to O
get O
our O

checked O

They O
took O
us O
to O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG

in O
Pozsonyi B-LOC

. O

First O
, O
they O
led O
us O
into O
a O
completely O
dark O
room O
, O
and O
later O
led O
us O
into O
another O
room O
, O
and O
on O
the O
pretext O
of O
checking O
our O
identity O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
committee O
seized B-TER
all O
our O
belongings O
. O

They O
took B-TER
my O
coat B-TER
, O
my O
gloves B-TER
, O
turned O
out O
my O
pockets O
, O
took O
off O
also O
the O
two O
blouses B-TER
I O
had O
on O
to O
search O
it O
and O
check O
whether O
I O
had O
not O
hidden O
anything O
or O
sewed O
something O
valuable O
in O
them O
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
they O
even O
seized B-TER
my O
handkerchief O
. O

Having O
searched B-TER
us O
they O
sent O
everyone O
into O
the O
lobby O
, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
all O
there O
, O
they O
rechecked B-TER
whether O
we O
did O
not O
leave O
anything O
behind O
, O
any O
food B-TER
in O
the O
searching O
room O
. O

Naturally O
, O
they O
collected O
what O
they O
still O
found O
there O
. O

Now O
, O
they O
led O
us O
back O
into O
the O
room O
where O
we O
were O
the O
first O
time O
. O

There O
were O
already O
some O
people B-TER
here O
when O
our O
group O
of O
36 O
people B-TER
arrived O
; O
at O
the O
end O
there O
might O
have O
been O
40 O
- O
42 O
of O
us O
altogether O
. O

Everyone O
tried O
to O
find O
some O
good O
posture O
. O

The O
guards O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
made O
sure O
we O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
if O
someone O
asked O
for O
water B-TER
, O
they O
conceded O
to O
give O
it O
. O

I O
have O
to O
note O
that O
we O
had O
lived O
so O
isolated O
from O
everything O
in O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
that O
we O
had O
not O
heard O
about O
the O
already O
frequent O
cases O
when O
they O
shot O
people O
into O
the O
Danube B-LOC
. O

I O
did O
not O
suspect O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
and O
believed O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be O
put O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
after O
they O
had O
robbed B-TER
us O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
someone O
asked O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
us O
, O
where O
they O
would O
bring O
us O
. O

They O
answered O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
Buda B-LOC
to O
do O
some O
work B-TER
. O

All O
day O
long O
we O
sat O
there O
gloomy O
and O
exhausted O
, O
while O
during O
the O
night O
we O
had O
to O
start O
off O
lined O
up O
in O
pairs O
. O

It O
was O
a O
light O
night O
with O
an O
open O
sky O
and O
we O
could O
clearly O
see O
the O
fights O
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
cold O
, O
as O
we O
were O
badly O
dressed B-TER
and O
had O
no O
coats B-TER
. O

We O
were O
walking O
along O
the O
Danube B-LOC
towards O
the O
Parliament B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
horrible O
what O
we O
saw O
: O
all O
the O
way O
along O
the O
bank O
of O
the O
Danube B-LOC
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
and O
horses O
were O
lying O
around O
. O

We O
arrived O
close O
to O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
where O
they O
wanted O
to O
lead O
us O
down O
the O
stairs O
next O
to O
the O
Parliament B-LOC
. O

My O
partner O
commented O
: O
Look O
, O
they O
want O
to O
do O
something O
evil O
. O

Since O
the O
stairs O
were O
already O
bombed B-TER
and O
we O
could O
not O
go O
down O
to O
the O
bank O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
leader O
told O
us O
we O
would O
go O
now O
to O
Buda B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
we O
did O
: O
We O
crossed O
the O
Danube B-LOC
on O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

On O
the O
other O
bank O
we O
started O
to O
head O
towards O
Margit B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
the O
lower O
quay O
. O

Women B-TER
went O
ahead O
, O
and O
men B-TER
– O
around O
eight O
of O
them O
– O
followed O
behind O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
the O
leader O
said O
that O
men B-TER
should O
stay O
behind O
and O
women B-TER
should O
proceed O
. O

Next O
, O
we O
heard O
more O
shots B-TER
from O
close O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
at O
my O
side O
commented O
again O
: O
Look O
, O
these O
have O
been O
shot O
! O
I O
still O
did O
not O
want O
to O
believe O
they O
could O
be O
so O
evil O
, O
and O
said O
it O
could O
not O
happen O
that O
so O
many O
people O
got O
shot B-TER
and O
you O
could O
not O
hear O
a O
voice O
. O

I O
still O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
meant O
if O
someone O
was O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O
from O
very O
close O
. O

The O
two O
leading O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
returned O
to O
us O
but O
without O
the O
men B-TER
and O
we O
still O
carried O
on O
a O
little O
while O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
they O
told O
us O
we O
should O
turn O
backwards O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
became O
convinced O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
could O
aim O
at O
was O
destroying B-TER
us I-TER
. O

If O
they O
had O
had O
another O
goal O
in O
mind O
we O
would O
have O
continued O
our O
walk O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
I O
was O
scared O
but O
rather O
I O
felt O
surprised O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
that O
everything O
would O
finish O
. O

The O
others O
were O
silent O
, O
too O
. O

They O
ordered O
us O
to O
stay O
one O
by O
one O
facing O
the O
Danube B-LOC
. O

It O
occurred O
only O
to O
a O
fifteen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
next O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
together O
with O
her O
mother B-TER
and O
aunt B-TER
, O
to O
start O
crying O
for O
help O
in O
her O
high O
childish O
voice O
. O

They O
started O
to O
shoot B-TER
them O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
; O
I O
instinctively O
threw O
myself O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
this O
idea O
came O
to O
my O
mind O
, O
now O
, O
I O
can O
not O
account O
for O
it O
; O
maybe O
I O
wanted O
to O
die B-TER
like O
this O
. O

The O
poor O
woman B-TER
next O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
hospital B-TER
after O
a O
suicide B-TER
attempt I-TER
and O
wanted O
to O
die B-TER
by O
force O
, O
started O
now O
crying O
after O
the O
first O
shot B-TER
that O
she O
was O
still O
alive O
. O

I O
heard O
the O
voice O
of O
one O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
as O
he O
asked O
who O
was O
shouting O
, O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
at O
her O
again O
. O

I O
decided O
not O
to O
move O
: O
either O
they O
would O
shoot B-TER
me O
and O
everything O
would O
be O
over O
in O
seconds O
or O
I O
would O
hold O
out O
. O

They O
checked O
whether O
I O
was O
still O
moving O
and O
I O
heard O
them O
to O
comment O
: O
This O
is O
dead O
already O
. O

They O
did O
not O
shoot B-TER
me O
not O
even O
in O
a O
second O
round O
, O
while O
they O
sent B-TER
another I-TER
bullet I-TER
in O
my O
neighbour O
. O

There O
was O
moonlight O
, O
and O
the O
water O
carried O
all O
sounds O
well O
, O
so O
I O
clearly O
heard O
and O
saw O
everything O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
now O
drop O
the O
corpses B-TER
into O
the O
Danube B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
simulate O
I O
was O
dead B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
with O
an O
eye O
that O
they O
began O
to O
drag O
the O
bodies B-TER
towards O
the O
water O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
when O
an O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
man O
grabbed O
my O
legs O
and O
pulled O
me O
away O
. O

I O
have O
to O
note O
that O
the O
bank O
of O
Danube B-LOC
is O
a O
steep O
and O
high O
wall O
here O
; O
there O
are O
no O
stairs O
at O
this O
part O
. O

I O
felt O
being O
pulled O
towards O
the O
wall O
and O
my O
upper O
body O
fell O
down O
and O
he O
let O
my O
legs O
fall O
, O
too O
. O

Once O
again O
I O
had O
luck O
, O
because O
the O
distance O
got O
shorter O
with O
the O
length O
of O
my O
body O
, O
so O
I O
fell O
less O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
I O
started O
falling O
and O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
man O
let O
my O
legs O
go O
but O
I O
did O
not O
fall O
into O
water O
but O
on O
a O
one O
and O
a O
half O
metres O
wide O
solid O
strip O
between O
the O
wall O
and O
water O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
cared O
about O
was O
to O
remain O
motionless O
. O

I O
fell O
on O
my O
face O
and O
did O
not O
even O
feel O
when O
I O
was O
hit O
, O
I O
saw O
only O
later O
that O
I O
fell O
on O
soft O
sand O
. O

I O
remained O
still O
in O
that O
position O
. O

Water O
was O
shallow O
here O
, O
and O
did O
not O
take O
away O
immediately O
the O
corpses B-TER
of O
my O
unfortunate O
companions O
. O

I O
heard O
as O
they O
said O
above O
me O
: O
Water O
will O
take O
them O
away O
. O

I O
heard O
this O
comment O
perfectly O
clearly O
, O
and O
studied O
everything O
precisely O
. O

Voices O
got O
further O
and O
further O
away O
; O
they O
left O
. O

I O
cautiously O
raised O
my O
head O
and O
looked O
up O
, O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
from O
behind O
: O
Do O
n’t O
move O
, O
because O
they O
are O
still O
here O
! O
My O
companion O
could O
see O
up O
on O
the O
wall O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
much O
I O
may O
have O
been O
waiting O
there O
: O
a O
half O
an O
hour O
or O
two O
hours O
. O

I O
calculated O
that O
they O
must O
have O
been O
already O
off O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
rise O
cautiously O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
me O
, O
whether O
I O
was O
alive O
and O
could O
stand O
up O
. O

I O
was O
uncertain O
about O
my O
situation O
and O
started O
to O
touch O
the O
parts O
of O
my O
body O
. O

I O
could O
stand O
up O
, O
nothing O
happened O
to O
me O
, O
only O
my O
nose O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
bleeding O
. O

It O
got O
injured O
when O
I O
fell O
on O
my O
face O
but O
it O
was O
only O
a O
minor O
graze O
. O

I O
looked O
around O
and O
tried O
to O
orient O
myself O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
dreaming O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
started O
to O
talk O
again O
: O
I O
am O
the O
sister O
of O
the O
caretaker O
and O
if O
you O
remain O
alive O
and O
can O
call O
for O
help O
, O
call O
the O
police O
or O
the O
ambulance O
. O

I O
knew O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
, O
as O
the O
ambulance B-TER
did O
not O
function O
in O
these O
times O
. O

I O
began O
screaming O
as O
loud O
as O
possible O
: O
Help O
, O
ambulance O
, O
police O
! O
I O
heard O
nothing O
but O
cries O
from O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
shot B-TER
men B-TER
and O
the O
noise O
of O
drifting O
ice O
. O

No O
one O
was O
around O
. O

I O
desperately O
realised O
that O
crying O
for O
help O
was O
pointless O
. O

In O
front O
of O
me O
there O
was O
the O
icy O
Danube B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
without O
a O
jacket B-TER
in O
the O
cold O
of O
January O
, O
behind O
, O
there O
was O
a O
steep O
wall O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
stairs O
, O
and O
corpses B-TER
lay O
all O
around O
. O

Russian B-ORG
shells O
were O
flying O
from O
Pest B-LOC
to I-LOC
Buda I-LOC
. O

I O
tried O
to O
help O
that O
poor O
agonising O
woman B-TER
, O
I O
pulled O
her O
a O
little O
bit O
towards O
the O
bank O
, O
she O
was O
awfully O
heavy O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
her O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
who O
the O
people O
were O
whom O
the O
bandits O
had O
shot O
. O

I O
found O
another O
breathing O
woman B-TER
and O
I O
pulled O
her O
out O
, O
too O
. O

I O
started O
thinking O
, O
and O
understood O
that O
I O
should O
not O
stay O
there O
but O
ought O
to O
get O
away O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

Far O
away O
I O
saw O
a O
military B-TER
landing O
stage O
with O
a O
bridge O
to O
the O
bank O
, O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
reach O
it O
at O
any O
price O
. O

I O
waded O
into O
water O
in O
the O
overshoes B-TER
I O
still O
had O
on O
and O
tried O
to O
reach O
the O
bridge O
. O

The O
water O
was O
deep O
and O
I O
failed O
. O

Now O
, O
however O
, O
the O
instinct O
for O
survival O
did O
start O
working O
in O
me O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
remain O
alive O
at O
any O
price O
. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
sandy O
strip O
, O
but O
not O
to O
the O
corpses B-TER
but O
a O
little O
bit O
further O
away O
. O

I O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
waited O
. O

Soon O
, O
around O
7 O
- O
8 O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
walked O
down O
the O
bridge O
and O
jumped O
into O
a O
wide O
military B-TER
boat O
and O
started O
to O
row O
exactly O
in O
my O
direction O
by O
chance O
. O

Their O
leader O
noticed O
me O
and O
said O
: O
Da O
ist O
jemand O
. O

Soon O
they O
reached O
the O
shore O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

They O
must O
have O
thought O
I O
had O
fallen O
off O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
their O
leader O
even O
asked O
: O
Hat O
Wehgetan O
? O
I O
promptly O
understood O
the O
situation O
and O
responded O
: O
Yes O
. O

They O
jumped O
out O
, O
and O
climbed O
on O
the O
wall O
, O
one O
standing O
on O
the O
other O
. O

I O
asked O
whether O
they O
could O
also O
help O
me O
up O
. O

The O
leader O
responded O
laughingly O
: O
Denken O
sie O
nicht O
, O
dass O
Sie O
sind O
einbischen O
schwach O
? O
I O
asked O
whether O
they O
could O
find O
an O
ambulance O
but O
he O
answered O
: O
Nein O
, O
da O
sind O
schon O
die O
Russen O
. O

However O
, O
he O
offered O
to O
put O
me O
in O
the O
boat O
and O
bring O
me O
to O
the O
bank O
, O
as O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
7 O
am O
soon O
when O
people B-TER
could O
stay O
in O
the O
street O
. O

I O
saw O
that O
he O
noticed O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
what O
he O
had O
said O
since O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
7 O
am O
was O
the O
time O
when O
already O
civilians O
could O
go O
in O
the O
street O
. O

They O
encouraged O
me O
that O
I O
would O
surely O
find O
a O
policeman B-TER
even O
if O
I O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
call O
the O
ambulance B-TER
. O

They O
lifted O
me O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
covered O
me O
with O
a O
blanket O
and O
landed O
at O
the O
military B-TER
bridge O
; O
their O
leader O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
bank O
and O
put O
a O
cover O
on O
me O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
bad O
but O
I O
tried O
to O
pretend O
I O
felt O
really O
bad O
. O

After O
a O
few O
steps O
, O
it O
came O
to O
my O
mind O
that O
I O
should O
thank O
them O
for O
their O
favour O
and O
also O
wanted O
to O
give O
back O
the O
blanket O
but O
their O
leader O
urged O
me O
to O
take O
it O
with O
me O
. O

I O
started O
off O
but O
now O
I O
had O
a O
great O
problem O
: O
I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
to O
go O
and O
what O
to O
do O
. O

First O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
go O
and O
see O
a O
Christian B-TER
friend O
of O
mine O
living O
in O
Buda B-LOC
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
her O
troubles O
and O
anyway O
my O
mother B-TER
remained O
in O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
whatever O
the O
cost O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
one O
could O
cross O
the O
bridge O
without O
getting O
his O
or O
her O
identity O
checked O
. O

I O
walked O
on O
the O
lower O
quay O
where O
I O
did O
not O
meet O
anyone O
. O

However O
, O
I O
needed O
to O
climb O
up O
when O
I O
reached O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

There O
were O
only O
soldiers B-TER
walking O
here O
, O
and O
no O
one O
cared O
about O
me O
, O
I O
was O
not O
at O
all O
a O
curious O
phenomenon O
, O
they O
must O
have O
thought O
I O
was O
rushing O
towards O
an O
air B-TER
raid I-TER
shelter O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
front O
of O
a O
guard B-TER
of O
three O
members O
on O
the O
bridge O
, O
and O
before O
they O
could O
have O
asked O
anything O
I O
asked O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
first O
aid O
station O
on O
the O
Pest B-LOC
bank O
of O
the O
river O
as O
I O
had O
been O
injured O
. O

By O
chance O
I O
was O
lucky O
again O
because O
a O
soldier B-TER
with O
a O
more O
sympathetic O
face O
responded O
that O
there O
were O
no O
first B-TER
- I-TER
aid I-TER
centres I-TER
on O
the O
Pest B-LOC
bank O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
think O
I O
had O
any O
problem O
with O
my O
face O
, O
it O
was O
at O
the O
most O
a O
little O
dirty O
. O

He O
suggested O
I O
should O
walk O
towards O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
first B-TER
- I-TER
aid I-TER
centre I-TER
also O
on O
the O
Buda B-LOC
bank O
. O

Naturally O
, O
I O
could O
do O
nothing O
else O
but O
go O
that O
way O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
a O
soldier B-TER
became O
suspicious O
of O
me O
and O
stood O
in O
my O
way O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
how O
I O
could O
cross O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
whether O
it O
was O
possible O
now O
to O
cross O
it O
, O
he O
asked O
why O
I O
wanted O
to O
cross O
the O
bridge O
and O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
there O
anyway O
. O

I O
said O
I O
had O
visited O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
but O
he O
kept O
on O
interrogating O
me O
and O
asked O
where O
this O
friend O
lived O
. O

I O
said O
in O
Lánchíd B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

Where O
is O
Lánchíd O
Street O
and O
where O
do O
you O
live O
? O
I O
said O
in O
Damjanich B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
I O
indicated O
my O
old O
flat O
and O
he O
continued O
to O
ask O
me O
how O
I O
would O
get O
from O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
to O
Damjanich B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

When O
I O
explained O
him O
the O
route O
his O
suspicion O
disappeared O
and O
told O
me O
that O
bridges O
were O
still O
not O
being O
bombed B-TER
, O
and O
one O
could O
cross O
them O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
did O
not O
ask O
anything O
from O
anyone O
but O
ran O
through O
the O
bridge O
trying O
to O
evade O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
guards O
. O

Kossuth B-LOC
Lajos I-LOC
Street I-LOC
looked O
very O
bad O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
got O
into O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
! O
The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
As O
a O
start O
, O
I O
have O
to O
comment O
that O
all O
actions O
, O
processes O
, O
and O
negotiations O
that O
regard O
either O
the O
times O
before O
Vadász O
Street O
or O
the O
emigration B-TER
, O
e.g. O
the O
letters B-TER
of I-TER
protection I-TER
, O
the O
protected B-TER
houses I-TER
, O
etc O
. O

were O
initiated O
and O
thought O
out O
by O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
office O
( O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
) O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Agency I-ORG
and O
by O
the O
Palestine B-LOC
Committee O
. O

The O
key O
and O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
success O
of O
these O
activities O
was O
the O
good O
rapport O
that O
existed O
between O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Consulate I-ORG
( O
e.g. O
the O
consul B-PER
) O
and O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
. O

It O
was O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Consulate I-ORG
, O
or O
more O
precisely O
, O
its O
special O
department O
called O
Delegation O
of O
Foreign O
Interests O
that O
represented O
the O
interests O
of O
both O
England B-ORG
and O
the O
US B-ORG
after O
they O
declared O
war B-TER
and O
also O
the O
case O
of O
emigration B-TER
to O
Palestine B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
people O
who O
wished O
to O
emigrate B-ORG
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
to O
add O
right O
away O
that O
as O
far O
as O
circumstances O
allowed O
the O
consulate B-ORG
, O
especially O
consul B-TER
Charles B-PER
Lutz I-PER
, O
did O
a O
great O
work O
representing O
these O
interests O
. O

The O
friendship O
that O
evolved O
through O
the O
permanent O
contact O
between O
consul B-TER
Lutz B-PER
and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
was O
of O
great O
use O
both O
concerning O
these O
initiations O
and O
their O
successful O
execution O
. O

This O
friendship O
let O
its O
beneficial O
influence O
felt O
in O
all O
activities O
of O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
establishing O
of O
the O
Vadász B-LOC
Street I-LOC
office O
was O
in O
particular O
the O
merit O
of O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
, O
which O
he O
– O
as O
a O
Zionist B-TER
and O
the O
representative O
of O
Szochnut B-ORG
in O
Hungary B-LOC
- O
wanted O
to O
use O
for O
saving O
Zionist B-TER
youth O
and O
cháluc B-TER
figures O
, O
that O
is O
, O
people O
who O
were O
so O
important O
for O
the O
Jewish O
population O
and O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Around O
the O
end O
of O
May O
, O
1944 O
, O
it O
became O
obvious O
to O
all O
of O
us O
that O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Kasztner B-PER
-group O
would O
not O
leave O
the O
country O
soon O
, O
or O
if O
it O
set O
off O
its O
way O
would O
not O
go O
through O
Romania B-LOC
and O
the O
destination O
would O
not O
be O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

We O
also O
understood O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
action O
would O
not O
lead O
to O
the O
rescue O
of O
great O
masses O
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
clutch O
of O
Germans B-TER
and O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

We O
had O
to O
find O
new O
ways O
for O
rescuing B-TER
Jewish O
people O
without O
delay O
. O

Deportations B-TER
in O
the O
country B-LOC
were O
already O
going O
on O
, O
and O
we O
already O
had O
testimonies O
regarding O
the O
dismay O
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
thanks O
to O
a O
few O
Polish B-TER
and O
Slovakian B-TER
chalucs B-TER
who O
had O
successfully O
escaped B-TER
. O

Therefore O
Krausz B-PER
’s I-PER
proposal O
regarding O
the O
awakening O
of O
the O
public O
opinion O
abroad O
as O
our O
most O
urgent O
duty O
was O
evident O
. O

He O
collected O
data O
concerning O
deportations B-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
with O
details O
of O
all O
the O
misery O
involved O
and O
attached O
to O
them O
to O
the O
testimonies B-ORG
regarding O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

He O
sent O
these O
documents O
to O
various O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassies I-ORG
and O
had O
them O
delivered O
to O
the O
US B-ORG
, O
to O
England B-ORG
and O
to O
the O
Pope B-PER
. O

He O
asked O
these O
governments B-TER
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
the O
Nazi B-TER
government B-TER
to O
stop O
this O
horror O
and O
to O
intervene O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
emigration B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
who O
remained O
still O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
carried O
to O
abroad O
- O
thanks O
to O
consul B-TER
Lutz B-PER
– O
by O
a O
Swiss B-LOC
courier O
, O
and O
the O
results O
followed O
surprisingly O
fast O
. O

These O
data O
and O
testimonies O
got O
to O
Roosevelt B-PER
, O
Churchill B-PER
, O
and O
the O
Pope B-PER
as O
we O
learnt O
from O
Swiss B-LOC
journals B-TER
sent O
to O
us O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
. O

( O
Some O
journals B-TER
published O
our O
material O
word O
by O
word O
, O
like O
the O
Neue B-TER
Züricher I-TER
Zeitung I-TER
on O
the O
deportation B-TER
from O
Nyíregyháza B-LOC
) O
. O

The O
three O
governments B-TER
commandingly O
intervened O
, O
and O
this O
reached O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
June O
the O
17th O
. O

When O
in O
the O
following O
few O
weeks O
negotiations O
between O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
and O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
still O
did O
not O
have O
any O
result O
this O
intervention O
was O
forcefully O
reasserted O
. O

( O
By O
the O
great O
bombings B-TER
of O
June O
and O
in O
particular O
of O
July O
. O

) O
The O
commanding O
ultimatum O
addressing O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
was O
mediated O
by O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
government I-ORG
. O

Consul B-TER
Lutz B-PER
received O
a O
long O
dispatch O
in O
which O
his O
government B-TER
certified O
to O
have O
received O
our O
material O
and O
instructed O
him O
to O
personally O
deliver O
the O
aforementioned O
forceful O
letter O
of O
intervention O
from O
the O
part O
of O
the O
great O
political O
powers O
. O

Several O
of O
us O
were O
present O
when O
he O
asked O
for O
an O
urgent O
audience O
from O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
Foreign I-TER
Affairs I-TER
on O
the O
phone O
. O

And O
when O
the O
deputy O
minister B-TER
asked O
something O
we O
could O
not O
hear O
he O
forcefully O
answered O
: O
No O
, O
Sir O
, O
exceptionally O
it O
regards O
not O
my O
government O
. O

I O
want O
to O
pass O
on O
information O
coming O
from O
the O
American O
government O
. O

Consul B-TER
Lutz B-PER
’s I-PER
intervention O
in O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
Foreign I-TER
Affairs I-TER
did O
not O
meet O
considerable O
resistance O
. O

There O
were O
some O
people O
also O
there O
who O
could O
observe O
the O
state O
of O
affairs O
objectively O
and O
took O
forthcoming O
events O
into O
consideration O
. O

However O
, O
they O
emphasised O
that O
this O
case O
did O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
but O
on O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

But O
it O
appeared O
that O
similar O
actions O
had O
their O
effects O
also O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
a O
new O
dispatch O
came O
from O
Switzerland B-LOC
in O
which O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
government I-ORG
instructed O
Lutz B-PER
to O
get O
prepared O
for O
the O
negotiations O
and O
start O
preparing O
the O
emigration B-TER
since O
German B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
in O
principle O
had O
given O
its O
consent O
. O

Already O
the O
day O
after O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
invited O
consul O
Lutz B-PER
for O
an O
audience O
. O

Early O
in O
the O
morning O
a O
meeting O
started O
in O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Interior I-TER
which O
lasted O
until O
late O
afternoon O
, O
where O
only O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
Miklós B-PER
Krausz I-PER
was O
invited O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Almost O
all O
ministries B-TER
together O
and O
also O
the O
National B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
for I-ORG
Controlling I-ORG
Foreigners I-ORG
were O
represented O
on O
this O
meeting O
, O
where O
the O
German B-PER
ambassador I-PER
’s I-PER
deputy O
appeared O
as O
well O
. O

The O
infamous O
gendarme O
Lieutenant B-PER
Colonel I-PER
Ferenczy I-PER
was O
also O
invited O
, O
probably O
as O
a O
known O
expert O
of O

The O
representative O
of O
the O
foreign B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
officially O
confirmed O
that O
the O
German B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
had O
approved O
the O
emigration B-ORG
of O
those O
who O
had O
a O
certificate B-TER
. O

Further O
, O
he O
announced O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
to O
halt O
deportations B-TER
and O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
conscriptions O
till O
the O
alia B-TER
was O
not O
concluded O
( O
till O
the O
31st O
of O
August O
) O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
number O
of O
emigrants B-TER
and O
details O
of O
their O
travel O
were O
discussed O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
protected O
houses O
- O
as O
places O
where O
the O
people O
who O
intended O
to O
alia B-TER
could O
be O
gathered O
- O
was O
first O
raised O
on O
this O
meeting O
. O

The O
story O
of O
Vadász O
- O
Street O
started O
here O
. O

We O
moved O
into O
the O
building O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
July O
. O

Collective O
passport O
and O
the O
Schutzpass O
that O
resulted O
from O
it O
were O
made O
here O
. O

Next O
to O
the O
60 O
- O
80,000 O
people B-TER
saved B-TER
by O
having O
a O
Schutzpass B-TER
, O
this O
place O
gave O
asylum O
to O
2,600 O
Jews O
, O
amongst O
them O
great O
masses O
of O
the O
Zionist B-TER
youth O
, O
who O
organised O
and O
led O
illegal O
and O
underground B-TER
actions O
. O

To O
be O
loyal O
to O
historical O
truth O
I O
also O
need O
to O
mention O
that O
among O
the O
protected O
people O
of O
Vadász O
Street O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
non O
- O
Jew O
leftists O
together O
with O
their O
numerous O
relatives B-TER
. O

An O
evening O
in O
December O
, O
I O
witnessed O
how O
three O
women B-TER
blue O
from O
the O
cold O
asked O
for O
asylum O
at O
least O
for O
a O
night O
at O
the O
gate O
claiming O
to O
have O
been O
relatives B-TER
of O
hunted O
leftists O
. O

As O
several O
people O
of O
the O
leftist O
fraction O
confirmed O
their O
identity O
they O
were O
let O
in O
and O
it O
was O
only O
natural O
that O
no O
one O
asked O
them O
later O
to O
leave O
. O

We O
should O
not O
be O
surprised O
therefore O
that O
the O
terrorist O
attempts O
on O
the O
banquet O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
in O
the O
city O
theatre O
were O
claimed O
to O
have O
originated O
from O
Vadász O
Street O
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
’ I-TER
raid O
the O
4th O
of O
December O
at O
daybreak O
, O
which O
commenced O
with O
a O
long O
series O
of O
shots O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
men O
with O
the O
sickle B-TER
- I-TER
feather I-TER
appeared O
on O
the O
roofs O
. O

Luckily O
, O
the O
main O
entrance O
to O
the O
street O
was O
well O
barred O
so O
they O
could O
not O
get O
in O
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
’ I-TER
squad O
started O
a O
long O
debate O
and O
negotiation O
with O
our O
leaders O
– O
in O
particular O
with O
Artúr B-PER
Weisz I-PER
. O

The O
commander B-TER
warned O
us O
that O
he O
would O
got O
the O
house O
searched O
by O
his O
own O
men O
unless O
we O
handed O
over O
the O
terrorists O
who O
attacked O
the O
City B-LOC
Theatre I-LOC
and O
all O
the O
available O
weapons O
. O

Although O
we O
did O
not O
know O
the O
men O
they O
wanted O
we O
did O
know O
about O
weapons O
. O

We O
started O
an O
endless O
number O
of O
telephone O
calls O
calling O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Interior I-TER
, O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of I-TER
Foreign I-TER
Affairs I-TER
, O
the O
city O
military B-TER
headquarters O
and O
other O
places O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
achieved O
that O
around O
noon O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
temporarily O
left O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
foresee O
when O
we O
would O
meet O
them O
again O
. O

Although O
gendarmes B-TER
did O
not O
return O
it O
became O
obvious O
that O
we O
would O
not O
be O
spared O
trouble O
. O

A O
sign O
of O
this O
was O
the O
visit O
of O
two O
detectives O
from O
the O
so O
- O
called O
National O
Committee O
of O
for O
Calling O
to O
Account O
one O
morning O
in O
Vadász O
Street O
. O

Their O
visit O
regarded O
again O
forged B-TER
Schutzpasses B-TER
but O
they O
were O
also O
deeply O
interested O
in O
the O
huge O
mass O
of O
people O
accommodated O
in O
the O
building O
. O

They O
did O
not O
hide O
their O
opinion O
that O
the O
whole O
building O
of O
the O
Embassy B-ORG
was O
just O
a O
great O
hiding B-TER
place O
, O
and O
told O
us O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
give O
their O
report O
directly O
to O
the O
leading O
brother O
of O
the O
nation O
and O
we O
could O
hope O
for O
great O
clearing O
actions O
against O
us O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
days O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
our O
agents O
frequently O
reported O
that O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
of O
the O
Garrison O
Albrecht O
was O
getting O
prepared O
for O
an O
action O
against O
Vadász O
Street O
. O

The O
first O
reports O
were O
quite O
fantastic O
. O

According O
to O
these O
the O
project O
was O
to O
lead O
us O
into O
the O
caves O
of O
Pálvölgy B-LOC
and O
then O
to O
kill B-TER
us O
with O
grenades O
. O

Later O
, O
we O
heard O
about O
only O
the O
killing O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
great O
surprise O
for O
our O
leaders O
when O
a O
squad O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
entered O
the O
building O
shooting O
around O
with O
their O
machineguns O
and O
throwing O
grenades O
the O
31st O
of O
December O
. O

This O
break B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
resulted O
in O
the O
death B-TER
of O
three O
and O
in O
17 O
injuries O
and O
it O
was O
a O
fortune O
that O
we O
could O
save O
the O
people O
drove O
out O
of O
the O
house O
to O
the O
street O
of O
being O
taken O
away O
using O
our O
rapports O
to O
the O
city O
military B-TER
headquarters O
and O
to O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters O
. O

This O
way O
we O
particularly O
upset O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
squad O
and O
this O
led O
to O
the O
capture O
of O
Artúr B-PER
Weisz I-PER
, O
a O
heroic O
figure O
and O
comrade O
, O
the O
day O
after O
. O

After O
this O
event O
, O
the O
bandits O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
broke B-TER
in I-TER
regularly O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
how O
we O
could O
have O
saved B-TER
the O
gathered O
mass O
if O
we O
had O
not O
been O
liberated B-TER

From O
July O
1942 O
to O
the O
end O
of O
September O
1944 O
I O
was O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

I O
went O
on O
the O
first O
of O
the O
labor B-TER
transports B-TER
to I-TER
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
spent O
5 O
days O
. O

On O
October O
5th O
, O
we O
were O
stuffed O
into O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
went O
through O
Olomouc B-LOC
, O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
and O
Salzburg B-LOC
to O
Kaufering B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
took O
3 O
days O
and O
we O
had O
a O
1½ O
kg O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
10 O
dkg O
of O
margarine B-TER
and O
10 O
dkg O
of O
salami B-TER
. O

But O
we O
were O
happy O
to O
be O
leaving O
terrible O
Auschwitz B-LOC
behind O
. O

At O
the O
Kaufering B-LOC
train O
station O
, O
our O
transport B-TER
( O
about O
1,500 O
men B-TER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
) O
was O
divided O
and O
I O
arrived O
together O
with O
about O
500 O
men B-TER
to O
3rd O
camp O
. O

The O
first O
2 O
- O
3 O
weeks O
it O
was O
bearable O
. O

There O
was O
n’t O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TER
, O
but O
we O
still O
had O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
bodily O
strength O
, O
and O
therefore O
we O
were O
n’t O
that O
starving B-TER
. O

But O
with O
the O
increasingly O
cold O
weather O
the O
food B-TER
rations O
got O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
and O
in O
November O
our O
first O
friend O
, O
Meir B-PER
Lindenbaum I-PER
, O
died B-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
chain O
of O
illnesses B-TER
, O
misery O
, O
and O
death B-TER
was O
never O
broken O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
contained O
about O
1,800 O
men B-TER
, O
mostly O
Hungarian B-TER
Jews O
, O
and O
you O
were O
basically O
lost O
if O
you O
could O
n’t O
speak O
Hungarian O
. O

We O
lived B-TER
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Erdbunker O
– O
long O
, O
underground O
buildings B-TER
with O
a O
single O
window O
, O
two O
rows O
of O
boards O
for O
sleeping O
, O
and O
a O
stove O
and O
a O
chimney O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

Every O
prisoner B-TER
had O
a O
blanket O
, O
a O
bowl O
, O
and O
a O
spoon O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Holzman O
commando B-TER
digging O
in O
the O
forest O
. O

After O
several O
weeks O
of O
work B-TER
, O
most O
of O
my O
friends O
had O
feet O
covered O
in O
sores O
and O
frostbite O
, O
and O
could O
barely O
drag O
themselves O
to O
their O
workplace B-TER
. O

This O
was O
the O
construction O
of O
an O
enormous O
munitions O
plant B-TER
, O
in O
fact O
of O
a O
whole O
town O
hidden O
in O
the O
woods O
. O

The O
forest O
was O
about O
2 O
km O
away O
from O
our O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
the O
first O
few O
months O
, O
one O
had O
to O
work B-TER
even O
if O
one O
had O
open O
, O
festering O
sores O
and O
a O
high O
fever B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
they O
would O
bring O
back O
from O
the O
commandos B-TER
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
friends O
who O
had O
died B-TER
while O
working B-TER
. O

Later O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
people I-TER
’s O
situation O
improved O
slightly O
, O
but O
the O
food B-TER
got O
worse O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
we O
were O
given O
about O
37 O
dkg O
of O
bread B-TER
per O
day O
, O
Zulags O
( O
2 O
dkg O
of O
margarine B-TER
, O
or O
a O
slice O
of O
salami B-TER
, O
a O
piece O
of O
cheese B-TER
, O
a O
pinch O
of O
butter B-TER
, O
a O
spoonful O
of O
marmalade B-TER
or O
synthetic O
honey B-TER
) O
, O
and O
a O
liter O
of O
watery O
soup B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Workers B-TER
were O
also O
given O
about O
20 O
dkg O
of O
bread B-TER
with O
margarine B-TER
and O
warm O
water O
( O
soup B-TER
) O
at O
noon O
at O
the O
place O
where O
we O
worked B-TER
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
extra O
food B-TER
for O
workers B-TER
was O
cut O
and O
the O
portion O
of O
bread B-TER
fluctuated O
between O
15 O
- O
25 O
dkg O
per O
day O
. O

The O
workday O
went O
like O
this O
: O
alarm O
at O
4:45 O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
at O
5:30 O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
7:00 O
leave O
for O
work B-TER
, O
at O
6:00 O
in O
the O
evening O
return O
from O
the O
commando B-TER
, O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
get O
in O
line O
in O
front O
of O
the O
kitchen O
. O

Lights O
were O
turned O
off O
in O
the O
bunkers O
at O
9:00 O
at O
night O
. O

This O
was O
the O
schedule O
and O
the O
food B-TER
was O
a O
regular O
häftling O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
’s O
block O
staff O
, O
medical B-TER
staff O
, O
and O
others O
had O
significant O
privileges O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
food B-TER
they O
were O
given O
, O
as O
well O
as O
at O
their O
work B-TER
, O
lodgings B-TER
, O
and O
the O
clothes B-TER
they O
received O
. O

The O
Lägerältester O
, O
his O
representative O
, O
and O
the O
leading O
capos B-TER
were O
aryans O
. O

They O
were O
housed B-TER
separately O
and O
the O
kitchens O
prepared O
food O
especially O
for O
them O
. O

Like O
everywhere O
else O
, O
people O
were O
afraid O
of O
infectious B-TER
diseases B-TER
, O
especially O
spotted O
typhus B-TER
. O

The O
gravely O
ill B-TER
were O
transported O
to O
the O
Krankenlager O
. O

All O
of O
us O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
very O
little O
hope O
of O
returning O
from O
there O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
were O
from O
the O
Moll O
commando B-TER
, O
where O
working B-TER
conditions O
were O
unbearable O
. O

After O
a O
commute O
of O
1½ O
hours O
, O
we O
worked B-TER
for O
12 O
hours O
with O
a O
half O
- O
hour O
break O
and O
then O
once O
again O
the O
1½ O
hour O
long O
commute O
back O
home O
. O

Work B-TER
was O
hard O
( O
carrying O
bags O
of O
cement O
, O
laying O
cement O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
and O
the O
only O
food B-TER
we O
received O
was O
a O
bowl O
of O
cold O
tea O
made O
from O
grass O
. O

The O
strongest O
of O
us O
did O
n’t O
last O
longer O
than O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Many O
of O
our O
best O
people B-TER
, O
mainly O
from O
the O
1st B-LOC
camp I-LOC
, O
lost O
their O
lives O
there O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
1,500 O
men B-TER
who O
came O
to O
the O
Kaufering B-LOC
camps B-TER
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
40 O
- O
50 O
returned O
. O

On O
March O
8th O
, O
a O
transport O
left O
from O
the O
3rd B-LOC
camp I-LOC
to O
Türkheim B-LOC
( O
5th B-LOC
camp I-LOC
) O
Kaufering O
- O
Lager O
V O
was O
Utting O
, O
Lager O
VI O
was O
Türkheim O
. O

I O
was O
also O
slated O
to O
be O
transported O
and O
I O
was O
happy O
because O
I O
told O
myself O
that O
nowhere O
could O
be O
worse O
than O
Kaufering B-LOC
. O

For O
the O
first O
few O
days O
I O
regretted O
it O
because O
we O
were O
so O
hungry B-TER
, O
but O
the O
conditions B-TER
soon O
improved O
and O
during O
the O
last O
weeks O
we O
received O
peeled O
potatoes B-TER
every O
day O
– O
the O
most O
ideal O
camp B-TER
food B-TER
, O
not O
only O
because O
it O
filled O
one O
up O
better O
than O
soup B-TER
, O
but O
it O
contained O
on O
the O
side O
potato B-TER
peels I-TER
, O
whole O
bowls O
of O
which O
, O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
luck O
and O
impertinence O
, O
could O
sometimes O
be O
collected O
from O
the O
capitalists O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
during O
the O
the O
first O
three O
weeks O
in O
Türkheim B-LOC
– O
unlike O
in O
other O
camps B-TER
, O
we O
were O
guarded O
only O
by O
Death O
’s O
Headers O
, O
and O
, O
when O
we O
were O
lucky O
, O
Czechs O
, O
of O
whom O
there O
were O
many O
. O

Then O
I O
became O
so O
weak O
and O
exhausted O
that O
the O
doctor B-TER
pronounced O
me O
a O
sick O
person O
and O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
krankenblock O
. O

An O
epidemic O
of O
spotted O
typhus B-TER
broke O
out O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
at O
the O
end O
of O
March O
. O

The O
number O
of O
those O
infected B-TER
rose O
every O
day O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
and O
in O
the O
end O
the O
doctors B-TER
stopped O
doing O
check O
- O
ups O
and O
marched O
whoever O
had O
a O
fever O
of O
over O
38 O
degrees O
straight O
to O
the O
typhus B-TER
ward O
. O

I O
was O
suffering O
from O
horrible O
diarrhea B-TER
, O
and O
since O
I O
also O
had O
a O
fever B-TER
, O
I O
, O
too O
, O
was O
placed O
among O
the O
typhus O
sufferers O
. O

Protests O
and O
screams O
did O
n’t O
help O
. O

I O
could O
n’t O
escape O
from O
typhus B-TER
in O
any O
case O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
one O
could O
do O
about O
the O
everpresent O
lice B-TER
. O

I O
lay O
for O
10 O
days O
with O
a O
high O
fever B-TER
and O
began O
to O
get O
better O
right O
when O
the O
order O
to O
evacuate B-TER
the O
camp B-TER
was O
issued O
. O

Whoever O
could O
walk O
went O
on O
foot O
; O
we O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
were O
driven O
by O
car O
to O
Landsberg B-LOC
( I-LOC
1st I-LOC
camp I-LOC
) I-LOC
. O

I O
spent O
two O
horrible O
days O
there O
in O
indescribable O
squalor O
and O
with O
barely O
any O
food B-TER
( O
at O
the O
time O
I O
weighed O
about O
45 O
kg O
, O
my O
height O
being O
187 O
cm O
) O
. O

Finally O
, O
this O
camp B-TER
, O
too O
, O
was O
evacuated B-TER
, O
and O
although O
I O
could O
barely O
stand O
, O
I O
walked O
, O
or O
rather O
crawled O
, O
to O
the O
train O
station O
near O
Holzmann O
, O
which O
was O
situated O
about O
3 O
kilometers O
away O
. O

There O
, O
they O
packed O
us O
onto O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
, O
and O
with O
the O
last O
of O
my O
strength O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
spot O
in O
a O
covered O
car O
because O
I O
was O
afraid O
of O
the O
rain O
of O
and O
air B-TER
strikes I-TER
. O

My O
fears O
were O
justified O
. O

We O
traveled O
a O
distance O
of O
30 O
km O
from O
Landsberg B-LOC
to O
Dachau B-LOC
for O
two O
days O
and O
two O
nights O
. O

On O
the O
last O
day O
and O
night O
it O
rained O
hard O
and O
constantly O
. O

We O
also O
experienced O
several O
serious O
air B-TER
strikes I-TER
– O
American B-TER
pilots O
probably O
thought O
we O
were O
a O
military O
transport O
. O

Many O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
; O
I O
was O
too O
weak O
and O
did O
n’t O
move O
from O
the O
car O
even O
when O
the O
shooting O
was O
at O
its O
peak O
. O

About O
3,000 O
of O
us O
left O
Landsberg B-LOC
and O
only O
about O
1,000 O
of O
us O
made O
it O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
alive O
. O

About O
200 O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
during O
the O
journey O
. O

These O
figures O
are O
not O
exact O
and O
are O
just O
my O
own O
estimate O
. O

In O
Dachau B-LOC
, O
we O
went O
through O
the O
disinfection O
process O
during O
the O
night O
of O
April O
28th O
, O
and O
then O
I O
slept O
like O
the O
dead O
for O
15 O
hours O
. O

I O
slept O
through O
the O
constant O
shelling O
of O
the O
town O
all O
through O
the O
night O
and O
even O
when O
the O
fight O
reached O
the O
camp B-TER
the O
following O
morning O
. O

Prisoners B-TER
participated O
in O
the O
fighting O
, O
and O
by O
the O
afternoon O
the O
U.S. B-LOC
flag O
flew O
over O
the O
main O
guard O
tower O
. O

Our O
liberators B-TER
arrived O
not O
a O
moment O
too O
soon O
, O
for O
we O
later O
learned O
that O
Himmler B-PER
had O
issued O
a O
special O
order O
to O
shoot B-TER
all O
of O
the O
Dachau B-LOC
prisoners B-TER

with O

We O
spent O
8½ O
months O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
where O
things O
had O
been O
so O
- O
so O
for O
us O
. O

We O
left B-TER
Theresienstadt B-LOC
on O
September O

, O
1943 O
, O
and O
, O
after O
a O
miserable O
two O
- O
day O
journey O
, O
we O
finally O
arrived O
at O
the O
Neu O

Berun O
train O
station O
. O

From O
there O
, O
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
quarantine B-TER
. O

After O
the O
usual O
procedures O
, O
such O
as O
a O
bath O
and O
a O
getting O
a O
tattoo O
( O
we O
were O
given O
the O
numbers O
147742 O
and O
147743 O
) O
, O
we O
were O
clothed O
in O
old O
rags B-TER
( O
children B-TER
in O
adult B-TER
clothing B-TER
) O
and O
housed B-TER
in O
camp B-TER
B I-TER
II I-TER
b I-TER
, O
where O
we O
spent O
6 O
whole O
months O
. O

We O
experienced O
so O
much O
in O
this O
place O
. O

Through O
the O
efforts O
of O
Fredy B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
, O
a O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
was O
established O
. O

We O
children B-TER
were O
better O
off O
than O
the O
adults B-TER
because O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
work B-TER
, O
our O
food B-TER
was O
a O
little O
bit O
better O
, O
and O
, O
later O
, O
our O
clothes B-TER
were O
better O
as O
well O
. O

Such O
was O
our O
life O
in O
the O
Birkenau B-LOC
children B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
under O
extremely O
harsh O
conditions B-TER
. O

A O
doctor B-TER
arrived O
in O
December O
( O
each O
camp B-TER
had O
a O
building B-TER
for O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
a O
single O
German O
doctor B-TER
, O
who O
generally O
did O
n’t O
know O
how O
to O
do O
much O
else O
besides O
sending O
as O
many O
people O
as O
possible O
to O
their O
graves O
, O
served O
several O
of O
these O
buildings B-TER
) O
. O

With O
a O
wave O
of O
his O
fingers O
, O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
decided O
who O
lived O
and O
who O
died O
, O
just O
like O
Nero O
did O
in O
ancient O
times O
. O

This O
renowned O
doctor B-TER
was O
very O
interested O
in O
us O
twins B-TER
, O
which O
was O
actually O
what O
saved O
us O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
came O
down O
with O
so O
many O
illnesses B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
took O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
us O
, O
but O
then O
he O
contracted B-TER
spotted O
typhus B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
him O
, O
we O
were O
tortured O
by O
the O
SSman B-TER
Buntrock B-PER
, O
who O
had O
a O
preference O
for O
beating O
children B-TER
. O

Another O
SSman B-TER
, O
probably O
a O
Russian B-TER
spy O
, O
who O
helped O
one O
of O
our O
people O
escape B-TER
, O
was O
shot B-TER
by O
other O
SS B-TER
officers I-TER
after O
he O
returned O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
fateful O
month O
of O
March O
began O
. O

This O
month O
took O
away O
our O
parents B-TER
and O
all O
of O
our O
closest O
friends O
— O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
we O
still O
had O
in O
our O
lives O
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
month O
, O
it O
was O
rumored O
that O
the O
entire O
transport B-TER
that O
had O
arrived O
in O
September O
1943 O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Heidebreck B-LOC
. O

And O
that O
’s O
exactly O
what O
happened O
. O

On O
March O
5th O
, O
postcards B-TER
on O
which O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
write O
to O
our O
relatives O
that O
we O
were O
healthy O
and O
doing O
fine O
were O
handed O
out O
. O

These O
cards B-TER
were O
sent O
dated O
March O
25 O
th- O
27 O
th O
. O

We O
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
write O
about O
our O
departure O
. O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
March O
6th O
, O
as O
usual O
: O
Blockälteste O
antreten O
— O
an O
order O
for O
the O
entire O
transport B-TER
to O
go O
to O
the O
lower O
section O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
immediately O
. O

From O
there O
they O
took O
us O
to O
camp B-TER
B B-LOC
II I-LOC
a I-LOC
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
rumors O
going O
about O
, O
for O
example O
that O
it O
was O
n’t O
a O
labor B-TER
transport I-TER
, O
but O
a O
chimney B-TER
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
believe O
it O
because O
we O
thought O
it O
was O
impossible O
. O

We O
waited O
all O
day O
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
transport B-TER
could O
n’t O
depart O
because O
100 O
persons B-TER
were O
to O
be O
reclaimed B-TER
. O

This O
news O
greatly O
disturbed O
us O
. O

A O
terrible O
sleepless O
night O
wreaked O
havoc O
with O
our O
nerves O
. O

The O
people B-TER
, O
who O
were O
now O
extremely O
distraught O
, O
did O
n’t O
pay O
attention O
to O
anything O
; O
everyone O
just O
wished O
for O
this O
uncertainty O
to O
end O
. O

Midday O
, O
on O
March O
7th O
, O
a O
call O
: O
Ordnung O

Block O
, O
Raportführer O
Buntrok O

. O

And O
he O
really O
came O
, O
read O
the O
names O
of O
several O
doctors B-TER
, O
and O
then O
we O
heard O
our O
names O
. O

We O
became O
very O
frightened O
, O
because O
father B-PER
's I-PER
name O
was O
n’t O
read O
, O
and O
mother B-PER
was O
n’t O
present O
on O
the O
block O
. O

Buntrok B-PER
assured O
father B-PER
that O
we O
would O
see O
one O
another O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
Krankenbau B-TER
of O
camp B-TER
B B-TER
II I-TER
b I-TER
. O

There O
, O
we O
found O
out O
what O
it O
was O
really O
all O
about O
. O

There O
were O
32 O
of O
us O
in O
total O
, O
twins B-TER
and O
doctors B-TER
combined O
. O

Mengele B-PER
reclaimed B-TER
us O
twins B-TER
because O
he O
was O
interested O
in O
us O
, O
as O
we O
’ve O
already O
mentioned O
. O

He O
came O
to O
see O
us O
the O
next O
day O
. O

When O
we O
told O
him O
that O
our O
parents B-TER
had O
left O
on O
the O
transport B-TER
, O
he O
said O
: O
Schade O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
found O
out O
that O
the O
cars O
had O
driven O
off O
during O
the O
night O
¨ O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
empty O
; O
flames O
shot O
up O
from O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

We O
will O
never O
forget O
this O
scene O
. O

But O
we O
did O
n’t O
believe O
that O
our O
parents B-TER
were O
dead B-TER
. O

However O
, O
we O
soon O
found O
out O
the O
truth O
from O
a O
doctor B-TER
who O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Sonderkommando B-TER
, O
who O
was O
forced O
to O
do O
this O
work B-TER
. O

Mengele B-PER
arrived O
the O
following O
day O
, O
and O
took O
us O
by O
car O
to O
the O
Roma B-LOC
camp I-LOC
, O
which O
was O
where O
his O
station O
was O
. O

There O
, O
he O
precisely O
measured O
and O
weighed O
us O
, O
measured O
the O
length O
and O
width O
of O
our O
fingers O
and O
nails O
, O
the O
length O
and O
width O
of O
our O
noses O
, O
and O
anything O
else O
that O
could O
be O
measured O
and O
weighed O
. O

He O
also O
took O
down O
the O
color O
of O
our O
hair O
and O
skin O
. O

He O
carefully O
inspected O
us O
. O

He O
took O
fingerprints O
of O
our O
hands O
and O
feet O
. O

He O
worked O
alone O
; O
he O
never O
entrusted O
anyone O
else O
with O
the O
tasks O
he O
was O
performing O
. O

Then O
they O
brought O
us O
to O
the O
Krankenbau B-TER
and O
life O
went O
on O
. O

We O
received O
2 O
liters O
of O
soup B-TER
per O
day O
, O
otherwise O
the O
food B-TER
was O
the O
same O
as O
before O
. O

We O
were O
also O
photographed O
and O
x O
- O
rayed O
. O

Jewish O
doctors B-TER
, O
who O
guaranteed O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
examinations O
with O
their O
lives O
, O
had O
to O
examine O
our O
nerves O
, O
eyes O
, O
teeth O

and O
ears O

. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
another O
transport B-TER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
with O
7½ O
thousand O
people B-TER
arrived O
in O
May O
. O

This O
brought O
the O
number O
of O
people B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
to O
12,500 O
, O
3,000 O
of O
whom O
left O
to O
work B-TER
. O

The O
rest O
were O
incinerated B-TER
within O
2 O
nights O
. O

We O
were O
taken O
to O
B B-LOC
II I-LOC
f I-LOC
. O

In O
this O
new O
camp B-LOC
, O
they O
drew B-TER
our I-TER
blood I-TER
, O
which O
made O
our O
weakened O
bodies O
feel O
even O
worse O
. O

There O
is O
one O
horrible O
experience O
that O
we O
will O
never O
forget O
: O
one O
of O
our O
torturers O
, O
the O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
Thilo B-PER
, O
was O
making O
a O
selection B-TER
, O
i.e. O
choosing O
the O
people B-TER
who O
would O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
and O
he O
took O
our O
names O
down O
. O

What O
we O
felt O
when O
he O
did O
this O
can O
not O
be O
described O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
Mengele B-PER
heard O
this O
and O
saved O
us O
because O
he O
still O
needed O
us O
. O

The O
front O
was O
approaching O
and O
the O
mood O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
lifted O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
I O
became O
a O
Pipel O
in O
the O
Krankenbau B-TER
, O
i.e. O
a O
runner O
, O
and O
so O
I O
was O
slightly O
better O
off O
. O

But O
then O
came O
winter O
and O
a O
new O
year O
, O
which O
was O
happier O
because O
we O
could O
hear O
the O
thunder O
of O
cannons O
. O

A O
rumor O
went O
around O
that O
the O
camp B-LOC
was O
going O
to O
be O
liquidated O
, O
but O
nothing O
happened O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
January O
16th O
, O
they O
led O
the O
first O
transport B-TER
on I-TER
foot I-TER
out O
of O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

The O
following O
days O
were O
extremely O
vexing O
, O
because O
one O
transport B-TER
after O
another O
departed O
. O

Everyone O
left O
voluntarily O
and O
we O
children B-TER
were O
the O
last O
to O
leave O
, O
partly O
because O
we O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
go O
. O

People O
had O
to O
walk B-TER
60 O
km O
in O
the O
cold O
and O
frost O
, O
poorly O
clothed B-TER
and O
hungry B-TER
. O

We O
expected O
to O
be O
told O
that O
trains B-TER
would O
come O
pick O
us O
up O
. O

We O
finally O
got O
what O
we O
wanted O
on O
January O
20th O
, O
the O
day O
the O
last O
SSman B-TER
left O
the O
camp B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
a O
wonderful O
time O
for O
us O
. O

We O
went O
wherever O
we O
wanted O
, O
ate B-TER
whatever O
we O
wanted O
, O
did O
whatever O
we O
felt O
like O
doing O
. O

We O
roamed O
around O
the O
SS B-TER
camp O
. O

In O
short O
, O
we O
were O
having O
a O
great O
time O
. O

We O
went O
without O
supervision O
for O
5 O
days O
. O

Then O
, O
a O
group O
of O
SDmen O
arrived O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
do B-TER
us I-TER
in I-TER
, O
but O
did O
n’t O
get O
the O
chance O
. O

They O
, O
too O
, O
fled O
, O
and O
so O
we O
stayed O
until O
January O
27th O
, O
when O
the O
victorious O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
took B-TER
over I-TER
. O

On O
March O
27th O
, O
the O
Czech B-TER
Svoboda B-TER
’s I-TER
Army I-TER
took O
charge O
of O
us O
and O
brought O
us O
to O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Out O
of O
our O
family B-TER
of O
18 O
, O
only O
3 O
of O
us O
survived O
. O

My O
Dears O
, O
We O
are O
overjoyed O
that O
we O
are O
finally O
in O
written B-TER
touch I-TER
with O
you O
and O
that O
we O
can O
write O
to O
you O
in O
our O
mother O
tongue O
. O

We O
have O
so O
much O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
n’t O
enough O
paper O
in O
the O
world O
that O
could O
contain O
it O
all O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
’s O
mostly O
all O
bad O
news O
. O

So O
little O
of O
it O
is O
good O
. O

As O
you O
have O
perhaps O
already O
learned O
from O
Maruška O
, O
out O
of O
our O
whole O
family O
only O
Hanka B-PER
and O
I O
returned O
, O
but O
we O
are O
happy O
that O
at O
least O
the O
two O
of O
us O
were O
reunited O
. O

I O
must O
tell O
you O
all O
about O
our O
departure O
from O
Prague B-LOC
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
Kurt B-PER
and O
I O
were O
transported O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
in O
July O
1943 O
to O
be O
with O
our O
parents O
and O
Hanka B-PER
. O

We O
were O
together O
there O
for O
1 O
¼ O
years O
. O

We O
were O
doing O
rather O
well O
, O
all O
told O
. O

Kurt B-PER
and O
my O
parents O
worked O
in O
the O
office O
, O
Hanka B-PER
in O
the O
bakery O
, O
and O
I O
mostly O
did O
nothing O
because O
I O
was O
sick B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1944 O
, O
we O
were O
gradually O
transported B-TER
— O
father B-PER
left O
separately O
, O
mother B-PER
with O
Hanka B-PER
, O
and O
I O
with O
Kurt B-PER
. O

All O
of O
the O
transports B-TER
went O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

You O
can O
not O
imagine O
what O
we O
suffered O
through O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
describe O
our O
experiences O
and O
so O
it O
’s O
perhaps O
a O
little O
cruel O
of O
me O
to O
write O
and O
tell O
you O
so O
directly O
that O
our O
dear O
mother B-PER
died B-TER
there O
. O

Father B-PER
, O
who O
successfully O
made O
it O
past O
the O
selection B-TER
process O
, O
was O
shot B-TER
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
border O
on O
May O
3rd O
, O
1945 O
, O
just O
5 O
days O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
during O
the O
evacuation B-TER
of O
the O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
where O
he O
was O
sent O
. O

Kurt B-PER
was O
separated O
from O
me O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
near O
the O
train O
and O
it O
was O
only O
when O
I O
returned O
to O
Prague B-LOC
that O
I O
learned O
that O
he O
was O
held O
for O
about O
3 O
weeks O
in O
the O
Small B-LOC
Fortress I-LOC
and O
was O
supposedly O
shot B-TER
there O
. O

We O
are O
positive O
regarding O
father B-PER
since O
he O
was O
with O
Hanka B-PER
’s O
young O
man B-TER
, O
who O
returned O
. O

Jirka O
also O
returned O
and O
we O
’re O
living B-TER
together O
with O
him O
now O
. O

I O
ran O
into O
Hanka B-PER
by O
happy O
chance O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

She O
had O
come O
back O
one O
month O
earlier O
than O
I O
and O
she O
no O
longer O
believed O
that O
I O
would O
return O
. O

I O
’m O
sure O
you O
can O
imagine O
what O
our O
life B-TER
is O
like O
now O
. O

Our O
financial O
situation O
is O
miserable O
; O
we O
do O
n’t O
have O
enough O
clothes B-TER
to O
wear O
. O

I O
’ll O
likely O
find O
an O
office O
job O
. O

Hanka B-PER
is O
graduating O
in O
September O
and O
then O
she O
’ll O
probably O
make O
her O
living O
as O
an O
illustrator O
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
is O
all O
that O
we O
wanted O
to O
tell O
you O
about O
what O
we O
went O
through O
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
the O
future O
holds O
. O

We O
are O
in O
touch O
with O
Maruška O
. O

Her O
little O
Jana O
is O
so O
adorable O
. O

We O
have O
visited O
them O
several O
times O
. O

Please O
write O
us O
soon O
and O
let O
us O
know O
if O
you O
are O
coming O
. O

We O
would O
love O
to O
see O
you O
, O
we O
have O
so O
much O
to O
tell O
. O

You O
ca O
n’t O
imagine O
how O
we O
are O
faring O
. O

But O
at O
least O
we O
are O
happy O
that O
you O
will O
come O
and O
see O
us O
. O

On O
20.10.1944 O
a O
labor B-TER
transport B-TER
was O
put O
together O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
in O
camp O
E. O
During O
the O
medical O
check O
- O
up O
, O
the O
examining O
SS B-TER
doctor B-TER
removed O
the O
following O
people O
due O
to O
physical O
weakness O
: O
Zeev B-PER
Scheck I-PER
, O
Egon B-PER
Haas I-PER
, O
and O
Bertl B-PER
Simonsohn I-PER
, O
because O
they O
looked O
very O
thin O
. O

They O
were O
assured O
that O
they O
would O
be O
sent O
as O
Stubendienst O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
for O
a O
short O
time O
so O
that O
they O
could O
get O
better O
and O
then O
be O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
. O

But O
they O
knew O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
Zeev B-PER
especially O
tried O
to O
get O
onto O
the O
transport B-TER
by O
showing O
his O
muscles O
and O
vowing O
that O
he O
was O
used O
to O
hard O
work O
, O
that O
he O
only O
appeared O
thin O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
completely O
healthy O
. O

Egon B-PER
Haas I-PER
and O
Bertl B-PER
Simonsohn I-PER
joined O
him O
. O

They O
were O
n’t O
successful O
, O
but O
were O
added O
to O
the O
transport B-TER
in O
the O
end O
only O
because O
some O
people O
were O
missing O
. O

It O
’s O
interesting O
that O
only O
4 O
people O
survived O
this O
transport B-TER
, O
and O
Zeev B-PER
and O
Bertl B-PER
are O
among O
them O

Report O
on O
the O
tragic O
fate O
of O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
’s I-PER
family O
. O

On O
December O
20th O
, O
1943 O
, O
roughly O
5,000 O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
and O
children B-TER
, O
most O
of O
them O
Czech B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
from O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

They O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
special O

called O
Czech O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
in I-TER
Birkenau I-TER
, O
section O

B I-TER
. O

Amongst O
them O
was O
the O
family O
of O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC

However O
, O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
, O
together O
with O
three O
companions O
, O
was O
called O
away O
from O
the O

the O
Auschwitz B-LOC
train O
station O
and O
brought O
by O
car O
to O
the O
main O

Here O
, O
they O
were O
imprisoned B-TER
in O
block O
no O
. O

11 O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Bunker O
, O
which O
was O
used O
as O
an O
investigation O
prison B-TER
by O
the O
camp O
Gestapo B-TER
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Politische O
Abteilung O
. O

Few O
made O
it O
out O
alive O
from O
there O
. O

It O
contained O
all O
kinds O
of O
instruments O
of O
torture O
, O
which O
were O
used O
to O
force O
either O
true O
or O
false O
confessions O
from O
the O
accused O
. O

Executions B-TER
took O
place O
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
this O
block O
. O

Edelstein B-PER
was O
interrogated B-TER
several O
times O
and O
accused O
of O
enabling O
the O
escape B-TER
of O
several O
people O
from O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
his O
family O
was O
in O
camp O
B B-TER
- I-TER
II I-TER
- I-TER
b I-TER
. O

His O
wife B-PER
worked O
at O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
, O
which O
was O
overseen O
by O
Fredy B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
. O

She O
, O
along O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
child B-PER
was O
faring O
quite O
well O
. O

Through O
Jakub B-PER
, O
who O
was O
a O
guard B-TER
in O
block O
no O
. O

11 O
, O
we O
managed O
to O
put O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
in O
contact O
with O
his O
family O
in O
Birkenau B-TER
. O

Two O
letters B-TER
were O
exchanged O
in O
secret O
. O

Sometime O
in O
February O
1944 O
, O
high O
- O
ranking O
SS B-TER
officer O
Eichmann B-PER
of O
the O
RSHA B-ORG
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-TER
- I-TER
Birkenau I-TER
. O

He O
spoke O
with O
Fredy B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
and O
Janowitz B-PER
, O
was O
briefed O
on O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
asked O
to O
see O
Edelstein B-PER
’s I-PER
wife B-PER
. O

He O
asked O
her O
how O
she O
was O
doing O
and O
whether O
she O
had O
a O
request O
. O

He O
also O
asked O
her O
whether O
she O
knew O
about O
her O
husband B-PER
. O

She O
requested O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
see O
her O
husband B-PER
. O

He O
promised O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
at O
a O
later O
date O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
write O
a O
letter B-TER
to O
her O
husband B-PER
, O
which O
he O
promised O
to O
deliver O
. O

Edelstein B-PER
was O
supposedly O
somewhere O
in O
the O
Reich B-TER
. O

About O
one O
month O
after O
his O
departure O
, O
the O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
Czech O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
took O
place O
. O

On O
March O
8th O
, O
3,860 O
men O
, O
women B-TER
, O
and O
children B-TER
from O
the O
transports B-TER
of O
September O
7th O
and O
9th O
, O
1943 O
, O
were O
annihilated B-TER
in O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
of O
Crematorium B-TER
I O
and O
II O
. O

We O
found O
out O
that O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of O
the O
Czech O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
were O
ordered O
Sonderbehandlung O
( O
SB O
) O
after O
being O
in O
quarantine B-TER
for O
half O
a O
year O
. O

According O
to O
this O
, O
the O
second O
liquidation B-TER
was O
then O
expected O
on O
June O
20th O
, O
1944 O
. O

The O
second O
liquidation B-TER
took O
place O
a O
short O
time O
later O
, O
but O
it O
it O
began O
exactly O
on O
June O
20th O
with O
the O
annihilation B-TER
of O
the O
Edelstein B-PER
family O
, O
which O
happened O
like O
this O
: O
On O
June O
20th O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
a O
prison B-TER
transport O
vehicle O
( O
paddy O
wagon O
) O
arrived O
in O
front O
of O
block O
no O
. O

11 O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
. O

The O
escorting O
SS B-TER
man O
from O
Politische O
Abteilung O
requested O
that O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
and O
his O
companions O
be O
brought O
to O
him O
. O

He O
told O
the O
guard B-TER
that O
they O
would O
be O
released O
to O
the O
Czech O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
and O
took O
their O
personal O
files O
with O
them O
. O

They O
told O
Edelstein B-PER
that O
he O
would O
go O
to O
his O
family O
. O

They O
were O
taken O
away O
by O
car O
, O
but O
not O
to O
the O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
they O
were O
brought O
to O
Crematorium B-TER
III O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

The O
same O
car O
then O
drove O
to O
the O
Family B-TER
Camp I-TER
, O
from O
where O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
Edelstein B-PER
’s I-PER
wife B-PER
and O
his O
family O
. O

That O
same O
day O
, O
E B-PER
. O

’s O
wife B-PER
, O
gravely O
ill B-TER
, O
lay O
in O
block O
no O
. O

32 O

The O
doctor B-TER
refused O
to O
release O
her O
with O
the O
explanation O
that O
she O
was O
unable O
to O
be O
transported O
. O

The O
car O
left O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
the O
car O
returned O
with O
a O
strict O
order O
by O
Schwarzhuber B-PER
, O
the O
commander B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O

her O

They O
were O
also O
brought O

Dear O
Glasers B-PER
, O
I O
have O
just O
received O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
Napoleon O
and O
I O
am O
as O
happy O
as O
a O
child O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
are O
healthy O
and O
home O
once O
again O
. O

In O
October O
last O
year O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
you O
were O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
that O
you O
were O
doing O
well O
, O
that O
little O
Hugo B-PER
was O
working O
in O
a O
bakery O
, O
and O
that O
after O
9 O
years O
– O
instead O
of O
after O
9 O
months O
– O
you O
had O
a O
boy B-TER
. O

Where O
, O
pray O
, O
is O
this O
child B-TER
? O
My O
mother O
was O
gassed B-TER
. O

I O
have O
some O
sad O
news O
for O
you O
, O
but O
you O
have O
seen O
so O
much O
that O
we O
need O
not O
hesitate O
, O
especially O
when O
it O
concerns O
our O
dearest O
loved O
ones O
. O

This O
is O
what O
happened O
: O
on O
December O
18th O
, O
1943 O
, O
when O
we O
were O
in O
the O
Fürstengrube B-LOC
camp B-TER
near O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
around O
midnight O
, O
the O
afternoon O
shift O
returned O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
was O
in O
KB B-TER
at O
the O
time O
. O

After O
being O
injured O
in O
the O
mine O
, O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
hemorrhage O
in O
my O
ankle O
and O
whatnot O
. O

Max B-PER
was O
a O
Vorarbeiter O
on O
the O
afternoon O
shift O
. O

Two O
days O
earlier O
, O
zugangi O
arrived O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
– O
Galicians B-LOC
– O
Jews O
from O
Galicia B-LOC
. O

Some O
lived O
nearby O
, O
on O
the O
border O
of O
Upper O
Silesia B-LOC
and O
Galicia B-LOC
. O

One O
of O
them O
escaped B-TER
at O
the O
start O
of O
his O
shift O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
was O
celebrating O
Julfest O
that O
day O
. O

When O
the O
shift O
returned O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
Lagerführer B-TER
- O
Hauptscharführer B-TER
Moll B-PER
( O
I O
remember O
his O
name O
, O
he O
’s O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
murderers O
in O
all O
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
Birkenau B-LOC
and O
their O
surroundings O
) O
was O
drunk O
when O
he O
let O
them O
in O
. O

He O
interrogated B-TER
the O
capo B-TER
and O
then O
Vorarbeiter O
Häftling B-TER
to O
find O
out O
who O
had O
escaped B-TER
, O
and O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
that O
Vorarbeiter O
was O
Max B-PER
. O

Max B-PER
thought O
that O
he O
could O
explain O
everything O
to O
the O
Lagerführer B-TER
and O
calm O
him O
down O
, O
but O
he O
miscalculated O
. O

The O
Lagerführer B-TER
shot B-TER
him O
and O
5 O
or O
6 O
other O
Häftlings B-TER
. O

He O
would O
have O
shot O
more O
if O
Max B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
, O
his O
deputy O
at O
the O
time O
, O
had O
n’t O
stopped O
him O
. O

Later O
, O
Max B-PER
Schmidt I-PER
became O
our O
Lagerführer B-TER
. O

I O
became O
a O
Rapportschreiber O
in O
December O
1944 O
, O
and O
I O
discovered O
a O
statement O
with O
the O
following O
contents O
: O
On O
8 O
. O

12 O
. O

1944 O
the O
afternoon O
shift O
returned O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
at O
the O
usual O
hour O
during O
an O
air O
raid O
siren O
. O

Häftling B-TER
Max B-PER
Glaser I-PER
, O
a O
Czech B-TER
Jew O
, O
suddenly O
attacked O
an O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
, O
using O
the O
cover O
of O
a O
total O
blackout B-TER
, O
and O
tried O
to O
grab O
his O
service O
pistol O
. O

But O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
managed O
to O
defend O
himself O
, O
discharged O
his O
weapon O
, O
and O
killed B-TER
him O
. O

Several O
häftlings B-TER
used O
the O
confusion O
to O
attempt O
a O
mass O
escape B-TER
– O
Massenausbruch B-TER
. O

The O
guards O
immediately O
opened O
fire O
on O
them O
, O
and O
shot B-TER
another O
5 O
or O
6 O
; O
one O
escaped B-TER
. O

This O
was O
followed O
by O
signatures O
. O

Maybe O
you O
have O
heard O
about O
this O
already O
. O

These O
are O
the O
facts O
I O

Thanks O
to O
Gonda B-PER
Redlich I-PER
and O
Fredy B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
, O
who O
, O
faithful O
to O
the O
tradition O
of O
the O
youth B-TER
movement O
that O
they O
were O
part O
of O
when O
they O
were O
young O
, O
immediately O
brought O
these O
children B-TER
under O
their O
wing O
and O
procured O
better O
conditions O
for O
them O
in O
this O
worst O
of O
places O
, O
the O
first O
special O
rooms O
for O
children B-TER
were O
soon O
created O
and O
, O
later O
, O
in O
February O
1942 O
, O
the O
first O
Home B-TER
for I-TER
Children I-TER
. O

Several O
people O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
administration O
understood O
the O
responsibility O
we O
had O
towards O
the O
children B-TER
and O
we O
tried O
to O
find O
all O
kinds O
of O
ways O
to O
make O
their O
life O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
easier O
. O

It O
was O
once O
again O
our O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
who O
, O
in O
the O
difficult O
and O
important O
discussion O
at O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
over O
whose O
slice B-TER
of I-TER
bread I-TER
would O
be O
shortened O
or O
whose O
portion O
increased O
, O
swayed O
the O
decision O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
children B-TER
with O
his O
courageous O
and O
lucid O
analysis O
. O

This O
perhaps O
unusually O
and O
cruelly O
disadvantaged O
the O
old B-TER
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
; O
it O
guaranteed O
a O
better O
future O
for O
the O
Jewish O
nation O
. O

This O
decision O
by O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
trickled O
down O
to O
all O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
kitchens O
, O
and O
streets O
. O

Everywhere O
, O
children B-TER
came O
under O
special O
care O
, O
they O
were O
given O
advantages O
, O
and O
if O
there O
was O
a O
happy O
sight O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
it O
was O
surely O
the O
happily O
playing O
children B-TER
, O
who O
seemed O
so O
carefree O
. O

But O
those O
who O
worked O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
with O
the O
children B-TER
knew O
how O
sometimes O
a O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
eyes O
would O
glisten O
, O
knew O
the O
look O
that O
asked O
why O
? O
to O
which O
no O
caretaker O
knew O
an O
appropriate O
because O
, O
knew O
that O
when O
the O
children B-TER
woke O
up O
at O
night O
they O
opened O
their O
eyes O
and O
saw O
an O
empty O
darkness O
, O
sometimes O
heard O
their O
silent O
crying O
that O
no O
medicine O
could O
cure O
, O
knew O
the O
complications O
and O
tragedy O
of O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
and O
its O
soul O
. O

No O
textbook O
of O
psychology O
exists O
yet O
that O
can O
teach O
us O
how O
to O
soothe O
them O
. O

For O
the O
children B-TER
, O
life O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
was O
led O
separately O
from O
the O
rest O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
principles O
of O
collective O
education B-TER
, O
the O
individual O
rooms O
constituted O
closed O
homes B-TER
, O
which O
set O
and O
managed O
their O
daily O
schedule O
. O

Besides O
their O
lessons O
, O
the O
children B-TER
had O
to O
do O
domestic O
work O
and O
organized O
frequent O
evening O
programs O
. O

The O
caretakers O
lived B-TER
with O
the O
children B-TER
and O
thus O
they O
could O
significantly O
influence O
their O
whole O
lives O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
were O
very O
few O
qualified O
people O
, O
and O
the O
caretaker O
's O
incompetence O
sometimes O
led O
to O
a O
difficult O
crisis O
in O
the O
home B-TER
. O

When O
the O
number O
of O
children B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
reached O
its O
peak O
, O
i.e. O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1943 O
, O
there O
were O
2,300 O
children B-TER
aged O
4 O
- O
18 O
receiving O
child O
care O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

Health B-TER
services I-TER
took O
care O
of O
children B-TER
younger O
than O
age O
4 O
, O
placing O
them O
either O
in O
the O
home B-TER
for O
infants B-TER
or O
in O
the O
home O
for O
toddlers B-TER
together O
with O
their O
mothers O
and O
the O
staff O
. O

Children B-TER
were O
not O
forced O
to O
move B-TER
into O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

The O
open O
youth B-TER
care O
looked O
after O
children B-TER
who O
were O
outside O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

The O
institution O
of O
open O
care O
consisted O
of O
the O
home B-TER
for O
mothers O
and O
children B-TER
( O
without O
a O
staff O
) O
, O
and O
Czech O
, O
German O
, O
and O
Hebrew O
kindergartens O
, O
attended O
by O
more O
than O
500 O
children B-TER
. O

Social O
nurses O
were O
also O
part O
of O
the O
open O
youth O
care O
. O

Children B-TER
regularly O
visited O
them O
, O
and O
the O
nurses O
performed O
health O
check O

ups O
and O
arranged O
all O
that O
was O
necessary O
for O
them O
, O
within O
the O
realm O
of O
possibilities O
. O

Children B-TER
up O
to O
age O
14 O
who O
lived O
with O
their O

went O
to O
the O
shelters O
every O
day O
, O
where O
they O
attended O
lessons O
in O
the O
most O
difficult O
circumstances O
thanks O
to O
the O
courage O
and O
devotion O
of O
the O

in O
the O

of O
the O

Young B-TER
people I-TER
over O

who O
lived O
either O
with O
their O

or O
in O

were O
forced B-TER
to I-TER

To O

this O
, O
a O
special O
section O
for O
the O
integration O
of O

people I-TER
into O

process O
was O
created O
in O
close O
cooperation O
with O
the O
youth B-TER
section O
and O
labor B-ORG
office I-ORG
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1943 O
, O
a O
total O
of O
1,673 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
in O
this O
section O
. O

Young B-TER
people I-TER
were O
assigned O
the O
type O
of O
work O
that O
would O
allow O
them O
to O
learn O
something O
, O
for O
example O
in O
agriculture B-TER
and O
gardening O
, O
crafts O
and O
production O
, O
healthcare B-TER
and O
education B-TER
. O

These O
young B-TER
people I-TER
were O
also O
taken O
care O
of O
by O
a O
special O
apprenticeship O
commission O
that O
also O
administered O
exams O
once O
their O
training O
was O
completed O
. O

To O

with O
all O
of O
these O

, O
a O

and O
a O
young B-TER

established O
. O

Besides O
the O
caretakers B-TER
’ O
ethical O
and O
practical O
goals O
, O
the O
youth B-ORG
section I-ORG
tried O
to O
expand O
the O
children B-TER
’s O
minds O
and O
thus O
stop O
the O

in O
the O

to O
the O
Jewish O
nation O
’s O
illustrious O
past O
and O
the O
life O
and O
work O
of O
the O
future O
, O
the O
caretakers B-TER
tried O
to O
neutralize O
the O
dismalness O
and O
hopelessness O
of O
their O
situation O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
these O
efforts O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

Transports B-TER
continued O
to O
arrive O
and O
depart O
; O
orders O
and O
bullying O
gave O
the O
children B-TER
no O
peace O
. O

Around O
15,000 O
children B-TER
passed O
through O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

A O
transport B-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
east I-TER
meant O
a O
death B-TER
sentence O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
protect O
children B-TER
younger O
than O
12 O
. O

But O
this O
age O
limit O
was O
gradually O
lowered O
, O
and O
in O
October O
1944 O
even O
babies B-TER
were O
transported O
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1944 O
- O
1945 O
, O
1,068 O
children B-TER
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC

and O
after O
the O

no O
more O
than O
100 O
children B-TER
older O

14 O
returned O
from O
the O

Unless O

the O
fortunate O
who O
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC

no O

All O

all O

They O

1941 O
as O
an O
N- O
transport B-TER

we O
had O
no O

that O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
sing B-TER
or O
put O
on O
a O
theater B-TER

during O
our O
imprisonment O

We O
were O
simply O
ready O
for O
a O
life O
of O
working B-TER
in O
factories O
etc O
. O

, O
as O
we O
had O
been O
told O
. O

However O
, O
it O
’s O
well O
known O
that O
things O
looked O
and O
ended O
up O
differently O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
in O
the O
beginning O
all O
we O
had O
was O
our O
fear O
of O
more O
transports B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC

We O
peeled O
potatoes O
a O
little O
and O
were O
terrified O
of O
the O
executions B-TER
that O
were O
taking O
place O
at O
the O
time O

But O
in O
two O

and O
when O

, O
one O

with O
the O
task O
of O
creating O
something O
that O
was O
given O
the O
name O
Freizeitgestaltung O
in O
the O
Dienstelle O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
was O
to O
put O
together O
fun O
and O
educational O
programs B-TER
, O
and O
organize O
language O
courses B-TER
and O
lectures B-TER
. O

If O
possible O
, O
also O
a O
library O
out O
of O
the O
books O
that O
individuals O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Thus O
my O
work O
began O
. O

I O
procured O
a O
room O
, O
a O
hall O
that O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
inhabited O
, O
I O
had O
benches O
brought O
in O
and O
carried O
some O
in O
myself O
, O
I O
looked O
for O
a O
musical B-TER
instrument O
, O
at O
least O
a O
harmonica B-TER
, O
which O
could O
only O
be O
played O
in O
secret O
, O
however O
, O
because O
it O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
have O
musical B-TER
instruments O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
held O
a O
so O
- O
called O
audition O
of O
everyone O
who O
had O
engaged O
in O
recitation B-TER
, O
singing B-TER
and O
dancing B-TER
, O
and O
I O
put O
together O
the O
first O
vibrant O
program B-TER
. O

On O
March O
21st O
, O
1942 O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
staff O
and O
Judenältester B-TER
Edelstein B-PER
came O
into O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
barracks B-TER
, O
which O
was O
a O
small O
miracle O
since O
men B-TER
were O
n’t O
allowed O
in O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
barracks B-TER
and O
vice O
versa O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
first O
cultural B-TER
evening O
took O
place O
, O
but O
it O
started O
at O
3 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

I O
made O
sure O
that O
the O
program B-TER
was O
stylish O
as O
well O
as O
educational O
. O

I O
sang B-TER
, O
a O
group O
of O
6 O
young O
girls B-TER
danced O
the O
Czech O
polka O
, O
and O
the O
Adler B-PER
sisters O
, O
the O
daughters O
of O
Friedrich B-PER
Adler I-PER
, O
recited O
and O
sang B-TER
several O
short O
operetta B-TER
soubrettes O
from O
days O
of O
yore O
. O

I O
welcomed O
the O
audience O
myself O
and O
performed B-TER
, O
and O
the O
whole O
event O
was O
so O
successful O
that O
not O
only O
did O
we O
repeat O
the O
same O
program B-TER
several O
times O
to O
allow O
as O
many O
women B-TER
as O
possible O
to O
be O
able O
to O
attend O
it O
, O
but O
we O
received O
permission O
for O
the O
whole O
group O
to O
visit O
other O
barracks B-TER
( O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
) O
, O
where O
we O
performed O
this O
show B-TER
. O

This O
is O
how O
we O
began O
to O
share O
our O
art O
with O
the O
poor O
souls O
so O
that O
they O
could O
forget O
about O
the O
dire O
poverty O
in O
which O
they O
were O
living O
if O
only O
for O
a O
moment O
. O

We O
also O
went O
to O
hospitals B-TER
and O
sang B-TER
and O
recited B-TER
between O
the O
beds O
, O
generally O
with O
no O
musical B-TER
accompaniment O
, O
which O
was O
very O
difficult O
for O
the O
male O
singer B-TER
or O
female O
singer B-TER
, O
who O
was O
used O
to O
standing O
on O
a O
stage O
and O
singing B-TER
accompanied O
by O
an O
orchestra O
. O

But O
we O
were O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
, O
because O
we O
brought O
the O
poor O
souls O
a O
little O
something O
from O
a O
better O
world O
. O

This O
was O
how O
it O
all O
began O
. O

In O
time O
, O
more O
and O
more O
former O
singers B-TER
, O
musicians B-TER
, O
and O
composers B-TER
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
administration O
came O
to O
see O
the O
theater O
in O
a O
different O
light O
. O

It O
gave O
us O
a O
space O
and O
got O
the O
kommandantur B-TER
to O
approve O
musical O
instruments O
, O
and O
so O
it O
happened O
that O
in O
the O
concentration O
camp O
, O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
deceased B-TER
bandleader B-TER
Rafael B-PER
Schächter I-PER
, O
we O
rehearsed O
and O
performed O
an O
entire O
opera B-TER
: O
The O
Bartered O
Bride O
by O
Bedřich B-PER
Smetana I-PER
. O

At O
night O
, O
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
where O
he O
lived B-TER
, O
Schächter B-PER
began O
to O
study O
Jewish O
choir B-TER
pieces O
with O
the O
help O
of O
a O
single O
tuning O
fork O
that O
I O
had O
lent O
him O
. O

He O
got O
the O
idea O
to O
study O
the O
choruses B-TER
from O
The O
Bartered O
Bride O
and O
I O
put O
together O
a O
group O
of O
girls B-TER
from O
our O
barracks B-TER
. O

He O
practiced O
with O
the O
men B-TER
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
and O
gradually O
, O
when O
the O
right O
soloists O
were O
found O
, O
we O
got O
the O
idea O
to O
do O
the O
whole O
opera B-TER
as O
a O
concert O
. O

Somewhere O
in O
the O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium I-LOC
was O
an O
old O
, O
battered O
piano O
without O
legs O
and O
he O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
half O
- O
broken O
harmonium O
, O
and O
, O
somewhere O
in O
the O
cellar O
, O
a O
tiny O
room O
where O
he O
could O
regularly O
practice O
with O
his O
group O
. O

During O
the O
coldest O
part O
of O
the O
winter O
, O
bundled O
up O
to O
our O
ears O
, O
we O
rehearsed O
The O
Bartered O
Bride O
. O

We O
were O
finally O
ready O
and O
now O
needed O
to O
move O
the O
piano O
at O
night O
in O
secret O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium I-LOC
could O
no O
longer O
be O
used O
. O

They O
let O
us O
use O
a O
gym O
in O
a O
boys B-TER
home I-TER
and O
we O
finally O
performed O
The O
Bartered O
Bride O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
on O
November O
28th O
, O
1942 O
. O

It O
was O
an O
unforgettable O
experience O
. O

When O
the O
first O
measures O
of O
Proč O
bychom O
se O
netěšili O
sounded O
there O
was O
n’t O
a O
dry O
eye O
in O
the O
house O
. O

We O
performed O
The O
Bartered O
Bride O
around O
35 O
times O
. O

Then O
we O
started O
rehearsing O
something O
new O
, O
this O
time O
The B-TER
Marriage I-TER
of I-TER
Figaro I-TER
, O
and O
in O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
we O
spent O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
we O
gradually O
performed O
the O
operas B-TER
The B-TER
Bartered I-TER
Bride I-TER
, O
The B-TER
Kiss I-TER
, O
The B-TER
Marriage I-TER
of I-TER
Figaro I-TER
, O
The B-TER
Magic I-TER
Flute I-TER
, O
Rigoletto B-TER
, O
Tosca B-TER
, O
Carmen B-TER
, O
Bastien B-TER
and I-TER
Bastienne I-TER
, O
La B-TER
Serva I-TER
Padrona I-TER
, O
Verdi B-PER
’s O
Requiem B-TER
, O
Tvorstvo B-TER
, O
Elias B-TER
, O
and O
many O
choir O
concerts B-TER
, O
many O
German O
and O
Czech O
plays B-TER
, O
countless O
cabarets B-TER
, O
even O
a O
circus O
performance B-TER
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
the O
Hamburg B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
and O
the O
Bauhof B-LOC
, O
a O
hundred O
individual O
piano O
, O
instrumental O
, O
and O
vocal B-TER
concerts B-TER
, O
in O
time O
even O
orchestral O
concerts O
conducted O
by O
the O
bandleader B-TER
Ančerle B-PER
, O
several O
operettas B-TER
, O
among O
them O
Die O
Fledermaus O
. O

In O
the O
year O
1943 O
- O
1944 O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
’s O
cultural B-TER
and O
theatrical B-TER
life O
was O
so O
full O
that O
a O
mid O
- O
sized O
city O
in O
peacetime O
had O
n’t O
put O
on O
as O
many O
events O
as O
we O
had O
in O
our O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

The O
theater B-TER
halls O
were O
small O
and O
limited O
; O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Raumwirtschaft O
needed O
everything O
when O
the O
transports B-TER
arrived O
. O

And O
so O
we O
had O
to O
establish O
small O
stages O
in O
the O
attics O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
and O
larger O
residential O
houses O
, O
where O
the O
acoustics O
were O
terrible O
, O
the O
heat O
in O
summer O
and O
the O
cold O
in O
winter O
was O
unbearable O
, O
that O
was O
for O
sure O
. O

But O
the O
audience O
’s O
enthusiasm O
and O
the O
performers O
’ O
joy O
made O
us O
forget O
these O
things O
. O

The O
performances O
were O
sold O
out O
even O
under O
these O
conditions O
. O

It O
seems O
strange O
that O
the O
SS B-TER
allowed O
Jews O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
cultivate O
music B-TER
, O
art B-TER
, O
lectures B-TER
etc O
. O

in O
such O
a O
way O
, O
but O
the O
gentlemen O
knew O
very O
well O
what O
they O
were O
doing O
. O

They O
wanted O
these O
things O
to O
help O
make O
Therezsienstadt B-LOC
a O
model O
to O
present O
to O
foreign O
countries O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Musterghetto O
. O

They O
awaited O
the O
arrival O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
commission B-ORG
, O
and O
so O
they O
even O
let O
us O
use O
the O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium I-LOC
and O
ordered O
the O
operas B-TER
to O
be O
performed O
perfectly O
, O
in O
costume O
and O
with O
wigs O
, O
basically O
a O
real O
theater B-TER
performance O
. O

And O
so O
real O
theater B-TER
, O
beautifully O
theatrically B-TER
staged O
, O
was O
played O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
May O
1944 O
, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Verschönerung B-TER
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Architects O
Zelenka B-PER
, O
Prof. O
Lederer O
and O
other O
famous O
artists B-TER
worked O
non O
- O
stop O
to O
prepare O
the O
various O
stages O
. O

All O
of O
the O
lighting O
equipment O
and O
light O
bulbs O
necessary O
for O
the O
theater B-TER
had O
to O
be O
brought O
into O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

A O
pavilion O
was O
erected O
in O
the O
square O
, O
where O
the O
town O
’s O
band O
, O
wonderful O
musicians B-TER
all O
of O
them O
and O
each O
individually O
a O
virtuoso O
, O
performed O
every O
day O
. O

The O
Trio O
played O
in O
the O
cafe O
and O
cabarets B-TER
( O
Hans B-PER
Hofer I-PER
) O
were O
held O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
performances O
took O
place O
outside O
in O
the O
courtyards O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
seemed O
like O
an O
El O
Dorado O
in O
Europe O
, O
a O
place O
where O
there O
are O
no O
air B-TER
strikes I-TER
, O
no O
fronts O
, O
in O
short O
, O
no O
dangers O
threatened O
it O
. O

The O
famous O
commission B-ORG
arrived O
and O
apparently O
went O
around O
. O

An O
utter O
farce O
was O
performed O
, O
children B-TER
had O
to O
run O
behind O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
komandant I-TER
, O
tug O
at O
his O
coat O
and O
cry O
: O
Uncle O
, O
come O
play O
with O
us O
, O
to O
which O
he O
replied O
: O
Today O
I O
can O
not O
, O
but O
tomorrow O
I O
shall O
. O

The O
famous O
film O
director O
Kurt B-PER
Geron I-PER
had O
to O
make O
a O
film B-TER
. O

Actors O
waited O
in O
the O
theaters B-TER
, O
ready O
to O
start O
playing O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
the O
commission B-ORG
set O
foot O
inside O
, O
as O
if O
the O
opera B-TER
or O
play B-TER
was O
already O
under O
way O
. O

After O
5 O
minutes O
, O
the O
commission B-ORG
moved O
on O
and O
the O
play B-TER
stopped O
. O

Everyone O
went O
home O
. O

The O
composers B-TER
Haas B-PER
, O
Krása B-PER
, O
Ullmann B-PER
, O
and O
Gideon B-PER
Klein I-PER
were O
also O
urged O
to O
compose O
operas B-TER
or O
songs B-TER
that O
then O
had O
to O
be O
played O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
itself O
ordered O
this O
. O

Two O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
operas B-TER
were O
also O
performed O
: O
Brundibár B-TER
, O
composed O
by O
Hans B-PER
Krása I-PER
, O
and O
Broučci B-TER
, O
a O
collection O
of O
Czech O
folk O
songs B-TER
, O
directed O
by O
Váva B-PER
Schönová I-PER
, O
the O
bandleader B-TER
Brok B-PER
, O
and O
the O
director O
Thein B-PER
. O

Children B-TER
up O
to O
age O
14 O
played O
and O
sang B-TER
. O

It O
seemed O
unimaginable O
that O
things O
could O
continue O
thus O
. O

And O
the O
ax O
did O
indeed O
come O
down O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
commission B-ORG
left O
, O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
began O
to O
be O
liquidated O
. O

In O
just O
4 O
weeks O
, O
18,600 O
Jews O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

In O
reality O
, O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
large O
part O
went O
directly O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
and O
only O
a O
small O
number O
, O
when O
it O
passed O
through O
the O
selection B-TER
process I-TER
, O
was O
sent O
on O
to O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

Almost O
all O
of O
the O
men B-TER
– O
artists B-TER
, O
actors B-TER
, O
composers B-TER
, O
singers B-TER
, O
bandleaders B-TER
, O
instrumentalists B-TER
– O
lost B-TER
their I-TER
lives I-TER
. O

Only O
seven O
women B-TER
out O
of O
the O
entire O
group O
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

They O
were O
forgotten O
about O
and O
so O
they O
did O
n’t O
go O
to O
the O
same O
place O
as O
the O
other O
18,600 O
. O

When O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
left O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
October O
28th O
1944 O
, O
Judenältester B-TER
Murmelstein B-PER
had O
to O
hand O
over O
to O
Lagerhalter O
Rahm B-PER
the O
remaining O
people O
who O
were O
not O
parading O
before O
him O
, O
and O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
7 O
women B-TER
– O
a O
singer B-TER
, O
a O
piano B-TER
player I-TER
, O
i.e. O
a O
piano B-TER
player I-TER
and O
actress B-TER
– O
were O
forgotten O
. O

When O
Murmelstein B-PER
asked O
whether O
they O
should O
be O
put O
on O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
, O
Rahm B-PER
, O
smiling O
condescendingly O
, O
said O
in O
his O
Viennese B-LOC
dialect O
: O
Aber O
was O
, O
lassenses O
da O
. O

Sollens O
dann O
wieder O
spielen O
und O
singen O
. O

This O
saved O
our O
lives O
. O

We O
immediately O
had O
to O
join O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Glimmerspalterei B-TER
, O
where O
we O
split O
mica B-TER
from O
5:30 O
in O
the O
morning O
until O
2:00 O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
but O
about O
3 O
days O
after O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
departed O
, O
I O
received O
an O
order O
to O
put O
together O
a O
new O
concert B-TER
program O
. O

And O
so O
we O
had O
to O
create O
an O
evening O
program O
to O
be O
held O
in O
the O
unheated O
space O
of O
the O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium I-LOC
and O
quickly O
rehearse O
the O
pieces O
, O
and O
once O
again O
sing B-TER
for O
those O
who O
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Four O
months O
went O
by O
, O
until O
March O
7th O
, O
1945 O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Rahm B-PER
took O
us O
off O
mica B-TER
duty O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
quickly O
rehearse O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
opera B-TER
Broučci B-TER
and O
the O
opera B-TER
The O
Tales O
of O
Hoffmann O
, O
because O
another O
commission O
was O
soon O
to O
arrive O
. O

Our O
days O
and O
nights O
were O
spent O
writing O
out O
the O
music O
, O
making O
sure O
the O
orchestra O
had O
the O
material O
it O
needed O
, O
rehearsing O
with O
the O
musicians B-TER
who O
had O
arrived B-TER
because O
they O
were O
married O
to O
an O
Aryan O
. O

And O
so O
we O
played O
again O
in O
the O
Sokol B-LOC
gymnasium I-LOC
in O
costume O
on O
a O
beautifully O
decorated O
stage O
. O

The O
commission O
arrived O
and O
everything O
went O
well O
, O
and O
life O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
seemed O
to O
be O
as O
it O
had O
been O
before O
the O
thousands O
had O
departed B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
around O
April O
20th O
, O
the O
1st O
transport B-TER
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
pajama O
wearers O
from O
Buchenwald B-LOC
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
our O
eyes O
were O
opened O
. O

We O
discovered O
the O
true O
reality O
and O
that O
day O
all O
of O
the O
singing B-TER
, O
playing B-TER
, O
and O
distracting O
ourselves O
stopped O
. O

We O
were O
in O
no O
mood O
to O
sing B-TER
. O

We O
were O
liberated B-TER
soon O
afterwards O
and O
our O
musical B-TER
artistic B-TER
career O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
came O
to O
an O
end O
. O

I O
sang B-TER
almost O
every O
day O
, O
played O
in O
all O
of O
the O
operas B-TER
, O
and O
I O
can O
probably O
say O
that O
singing B-TER
and O
my O
art O
was O
the O
one O
thing O
that O
saved O
my O
life O
and O
spared O
me O
from O
the O
suffering O
that O
thousands O
of O
my O
brothers O
and O
sister O
must O
have O
experienced O
. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
the O
longest O
and O
worst O
- O
paid O
engagement O
in O
my O
entire O
musical B-TER
and O
theatrical B-TER
career O
. O

all O

So O
few O
of O

It O

We O
get O
off O

As O
if O
our O
lethargy O

left O
us O

all O
at O
once O
a O
thousand O

How O

Did O
we O

What O

? O
That O
would O
be O
wonderful O
, O
the O
girls B-TER
speculate O
, O
and O
we O
slowly O
become O
interested O
in O
our O
fate O
. O

We O
’ve O
arrived O

Stunning O
, O
vast O
moorlands O
in O
full O
bloom O
, O
dark O
purple O
, O
with O
beautifully O
green O
thin O
pines O
greet O
us O
with O
their O
rustling O

A O
smiling O
sun O
in O
its O
full O
beauty O
in O
a O
clear O
winter O
sky O
– O
it O
ca O
n’t O
be O
possible O
that O
we O
are O
going O
to O
our O
deaths B-TER
. O

Not O
possible O
? O
Haha O
. O

What O
is O
it O
? O
Several O
large O
circus O
tents B-TER
. O

They O
’re O
quarters O
for O
about O
12,000 O
women O
. O

On O
the O
ground O
, O
one O
on O
top O
of O
another O
. O

The O
stronger O
one O
has O
seized O
some O
hay O
to O
sleep O
on O
, O
the O
weak O
one O
has O
nothing O
but O
a O
blanket O
. O

There O
are O
no O
socks O
… O
only O
the O
lucky O
ones O
have O
pants O
… O
and O
it O
grows O
more O
freezing O
by O
the O
day O
– O
it O
’s O
November O

Maybe O
something O
or O
someone O
exists O
in O
heaven O
who O
can O
no O
longer O
look O
at O
the O
thousands O
of O
wretched O
, O
emaciated O
women B-TER
undress O
and O
wash O
themselves O
outside O
, O
and O
there O
’s O
so O
little O
water O
and O
no O
rags O
to O
dry O
yourself O
with O
, O
and O
while O
you O
’re O
washing O
yourself O
someone O
steals O
your O
last O
piece O
of O
rag O
in O
their O
wooden O
clog O

The O
sky O
turned O
a O
menacing O
color O
, O
the O
wind O
foreshadows O
a O
catastrophe O

It O
’s O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
book O
The O
Rains O
Came O
comes O
to O
me O
unbidden O
and O
I O
feel O
that O
something O
big O
is O
coming O
. O

Only O
lightning O
illuminates O
the O
terrifyingly O
dark O
landscape O
, O
you O
ca O
n’t O
hear O
your O
neighbor O
speak O
over O
the O
wailing O
wind O
– O
the O
canvases O
are O
billowing O
out O
more O
and O
more O
and O
the O
cries O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
our O
calls O
for O
help O
vanish O
in O
the O
canvases O
’ O
struggle O
with O
the O
wooden O
pillars O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
each O
of O
us O
is O
living O
for O
herself O
alone O
. O

Who O
is O
n’t O
thinking O
about O
their O
loved O
ones O
? O
Our O
time O
has O
come O
. O

The O
main O
pole O
of O
the O
tent O
has O
become O
loose O
, O
the O
canvases O
and O
the O
wood O
slide O
between O
our O
bodies O
– O
panic O
, O
screaming O
, O
wailing O
, O
… O
Eva O
, O
Nita O
, O
Anča O
, O
Valina O
– O
are O
you O
alive O
? O
What O
, O
Helga O
? O

. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
who O
did O
n’t O
make O
it O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
twelve O
tents B-TER
, O
only O
one O
, O
badly O
damaged O
, O
remained O
standing O
. O

This O
terrible O
night O
, O
during O
which O
the O
hair O
of O
many O
of O
us O
went O
white O
with O
fear O
, O
was O
followed O
by O
36 O
hours O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
before O
we O
set O
ourselves O
up O
in O
as O
yet O
unsettled O
barracks B-TER
, O
where O
we O
slept O
in O
three O
- O
tier O
bunks O
, O
2 O
in O
each O
bed O
, O
and O
each O
with O
only O
one O
blanket O
, O
beneath O
us O
a O
thin O
straw O
mattress O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
lived O
through O
December O
with O
no O
clothes O
, O
spoon O
, O
or O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
like O
children O
we O
looked O
forward O
to O
Christmas O
when O
we O
could O
perhaps O
receive O
an O
extra O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Around O
December O
12th O
, O
a O
story O
started O
to O
go O
around O
that O
the O
camp B-TER
would O
be O
liquidated O
. O

Almost O
every O
day O
, O
larger O
and O
smaller O
groups O
would O
be O
selected O
and O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
Czechs B-TER
always O
boarded O
in O
an O
orderly O
manner O
, O
while O
female O
prisoners B-TER
of O
other O
nationalities O
were O
constantly O
eluding O
, O
dodging O
, O
etc O
. O

We O
were O
n’t O
selected O
until O
December O
20th O
– O
nobody O
wanted O
us O
, O
we O
were O
too O
weak O
. O

We O
’ll O
be O
left O
in O
peace O
over O
the O
holidays O
, O
I O
speculated O
, O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
. O

On O
December O
24th O
, O
when O
we O
were O
so O
disappointed O
because O
we O
did O
n’t O
get O
even O
an O
extra O
crumb O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
they O
selected O
us O
and O
we O
heard O
that O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
on O
January O
20th O
. O

Czech B-TER
women I-TER
had O
a O
reputation O
of O
being O
good O
workers O
. O

January O
in O
this O
camp B-TER
was O
horrible O
. O

Transports B-TER
arrived O
constantly O
and O
not O
a O
single O
morning O
went O
by O
when O
there O
was O
n’t O
a O
heap O
of O
dead B-TER
naked O
bodies O
( O
the O
most O
valuable O
thing O
about O
them O
was O
their O
clothes O
) O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

A O
wagon O
came O
by O
regularly O
to O
collect O
them O
. O

Sick B-TER
women O
were O
constantly O
returning O
from O
work B-TER
in O
such O
a O
state O
that O
they O
were O
just O
dragging O
their O
bones O
back O
to O
bed O
. O

This O
is O
how O
our O
friend O
Dr. O
Wolfová B-PER
returned O
. O

Fourteen O
days O
ago O
she O
was O
on O
her O
feet O
and O
now O
she O
could O
n’t O
even O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
– O
she O
was O
covered O
in O
wounds O
… O
We O
were O
increasingly O
beset O
by O
lice O
, O
and O
, O
along O
with O
them O
, O
typhus B-TER
. O

Blocks O
for O
the O
sick B-TER
were O
the O
seals O
of O
the O
numbered O
days O
of O
your O
life O
. O

Yesterday O
was O
January O
20th O
and O
we O
still O
have O
n’t O
left O
. O

What O
? O
Are O
we O
sentenced O
to O
die B-TER
here O
? O
Do O
n’t O
we O
have O
to O
drag O
our O
bones O
to O
another O
region O
? O
At O
least O
to O
properly O
eat B-TER
and O
wash O
ourselves O
– O
and O
then O
let O
God O
’s O
will O
be O
done O
. O

A O
miracle O
occurred O

On O
February O
10th O
, O
while O
the O
last O
turnip O
soup B-TER
was O
being O
doled O
out O
inside O
the O
horrible O
transport O

, O
where O
getting O

meant O
winning O

an O

anything O

there O
’s O
no O

that O

she O

The O
number O

it O
can O
be O
assumed O
that O
no O
more O
than O
25 O

Since O
all O

– O
like O
all O
the O

sometimes O
the O
mothers B-TER
were O
advised O
to O
give O
their O
children B-TER
to O
older O

. O

There O
were O
even O
cases O
of O
children B-TER
being O
violently O
torn O
away O
from O
their O

Only O
rarely O
did O
a O
mother B-TER
know O
what O
awaited O
her O
and O
still O
handed O
over O
her O
child B-TER
. O

There O
were O
some O
cases O
of O
children B-TER
who O
were O
more O
mature O
and O
understood O
the O
situation O
, O
who O
stated O
that O
they O
were O
orphans B-TER

thus O
saved O
their O

If O
a O
smaller O
transport B-TER
– O
under O
50 O

– O
arrived O
, O
its O

were O

but O
were O
killed B-TER

a O

This O
was O
done O
with O

then O
the O

burned O

This O
was O
also O
done O

These O

a O
certain O

The O
corpses B-TER
were O
then O
dragged O
away O

and O
so O
the O
next O
people B-TER
in O
line O
did O
n’t O
know O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
although O
blood O
could O
be O
seen O

After O
the O
transports B-TER
from I-TER
Theresienstadt I-TER
came O
the O
transports B-TER
from I-TER
Slovakia I-TER
, O
roughly O
10,000 O

They O
were O

On O
December O

1944 O
, O
Crematoria B-TER

The O
whole O

mobilized O
and O
made O
to O
perform O
this O
work B-TER
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
several O
SS B-TER
men I-TER

After O
this O
date O
, O
only O
very O
small O
transports B-TER
arrived O
. O

Gassing B-TER
stopped O
altogether O

The O
crematoria B-TER

were O
blown O
up O
on O
January O

1945 O
, O
several O
hours O
before O
the O

During O
this O
whole O
time O

and O
a O

Later O
, O
they O
were O

with O
a O

During O
Passover B-TER

2 O
Rabbis B-TER

They O
were O
allowed O
to O
keep O
their O

, O
their O
hair O
and O

were O

cut O
, O
they O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
work B-TER
, O
they O
were O
often O
photographed O
, O
and O
had O
to O
write O
a O
letter B-TER
stating O
that O
they O
were O
treated O
well O
and O
that O
they O
were O
performing O
their O
religious O
functions O

This O
comedy O
did O

They O
were O
sent O

the O

In O
the O

of O
1944 O
, O
twins O
, O
midgets O
, O
and O
people B-TER
with O
other O
physical B-TER

were O
selected B-TER
from O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC

Theresienstadt B-TER

Slovak B-TER

sent O

From O
1942 O
to O
1944 O
, O
the O
Lagerführers B-TER
in O

: O
Obersturmführer B-TER
Schwarzhuber B-PER

we O

the O
Polish B-TER

Stenia B-PER

The O
underground B-TER
movement I-TER
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
began O
in O
May O
1943 O
in O
the O
sauna O
in O
the O

One O
Polish B-TER
Jew I-TER

Fuchs B-PER

and O
2 O
Jews B-TER
from O
France B-LOC
( O
Stein B-PER
and O
Handelsmann B-PER
) O
first O
agreed O
to O
mutually O
help O
illegal B-TER
workers O
. O

Those O
who O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
better O
commandos O
agreed O
to O
help O
their O
comrades O
. O

The O
movement B-TER
did O
not O
have O
a O
clear O
ideology O
. O

It O
was O
an O
underground B-TER
liberation I-TER
movement I-TER
. O

The O
organization B-TER
could O
exist O
because O
at O
the O
time O
people B-TER
could O
move O
around O
the O
camp B-LOC
with O
greater O
freedom O
than O
before O
( O
prisoners B-TER
could O
meet O
after O
work B-TER
, O
the O
death B-TER
penalty O
was O
banned O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
Their O
membership B-TER
was O
small O
because O
they O
only O
accepted O
people B-TER
who O
were O
known O
to O
have O
performed O
illegal B-TER
work I-TER
before O
arriving O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
. O

Later O
, O
the O
organization B-TER
also O
contained O
women B-TER
, O
mainly O
French B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
. O

In O
terms O
of O
nationality O
, O
its O
members O
were O
mainly O
Polish B-TER
and O
French B-LOC
Jews B-TER
, O
there O
were O
also O
several O
Czech B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
several O
Jewish O
women B-TER
, O
and O
one O
German B-TER
who O
was O
not O
a O
Jew O
. O

When O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
transports B-TER
began O
to O
arrive O
, O
gassing B-TER
was O
supposed O
to O
cease O
and O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
procure O
explosives O
and O
weapons O
. O

The O
women B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
Union O
commando O
, O
Auschwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
( O
a O
munitions O
factory O
) O
, O
acquired O
dynamite O
in O
small O
doses O
. O

The O
dynamite O
was O
used O
to O
make O
small O
handmade O
grenades O
in O
Crematorium B-TER
I. O
With O
the O
help O
of O
Russian B-TER
prisoners B-TER
, O
we O
managed O
to O
acquire O
4 O
revolvers O
. O

One O
Belgian B-LOC
Jew B-TER
got O
a O
machine O
gun O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Russians B-TER

The O
committee O
that O
orchestrated O
the O
uprising B-TER
was O
composed O
of O
Alexandre B-PER
Lazar I-PER
( O
France B-LOC

and O
two O
Polish B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
David O
and O
Minko O
, O
who O
fought O
in O
the O
Spanish B-LOC
Civil O
War B-TER
. O

To O
establish O
contact O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
the O
Pole B-TER
Kostek B-PER
was O
sent O
to O
the O
join O
the O
partisans B-TER
in O
the O
area O
. O

We O
soon O
received O
an O
order O
from O
the O
outside O
that O
we O
should O
n’t O
start O
anything O
without O
outside O
help O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
continued O
organizing B-TER
and O
creating O
cells B-TER
. O

The O
movement B-TER
was O
rather O
strong O
at O
the O
time O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
Effektenlager O
110 O
people B-TER
were O
part O
of O
the O
movement B-TER
. O

We O
were O
never O
betrayed O
. O

We O
got O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
Russians B-TER
and O
began O
planning O
an O
uprising B-TER
. O

But O
the O
Russians B-TER
were O
also O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
we O
should O
n’t O
prepare O
anything O
more O
without O
help O
from O
the O
outside O

300 O
men B-TER

They O
attacked O
Crematorium B-TER

threw O
dynamite O

into O
the O

and O
crematorium B-TER

The O

, O
headed O
by O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Hahn B-PER
, O
who O
was O
personally O
armed O
with O
a O
rifle O
, O
arrived O
at O
the O
scene O

They O
killed B-TER
378 O

Half O
an O
hour O
later O
, O
the O
Sonderkommando B-TER
of O
Crematorium B-TER
I O
killed B-TER
the O
head O
capo B-TER
and O
threw O
him O
into O
the O
fire O

Then O
, O
they O
cut O
the O
wires O

shouted O
: O
The O
Russians O

here O

and O
ran O

The O
SS B-TER
surrounded O

all O

All O
in O
all O

455 O

that O
day O

The O
whole O

a O

but O
the O
illegal B-TER

did O

participate O
in O
it O
because O
it O
did O

get O
an O

On O

of O

The O
deportation B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
former O
Protectorate B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
began O
in O
1941 O
; O
5,000 O
individuals O
from O
Prague B-LOC
and O
1,000 O
from O
Brno B-LOC
were B-TER
brought I-TER
to O
Polish B-LOC
ghettos B-TER
. O

The O
leadership O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
religious I-ORG
community I-ORG
at O
the O
time O
wrote O
and O
spoke O
out O
to O
prevent O
further O
transports B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
reassured O
it O
that O
after O
these O
6,000 O
there O
would O
be O
no O
other O
transports B-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
Protectorate I-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Edelstein B-PER
continued O
to O
work O
on O
his O
concept O
: O
He O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
our O
only O
hope O
in O
the O
war O
was O
the O
Jewish O
workforce B-TER
. O

He O
tried O
to O
convince O
the O
Germans O
that O
in O
wartime B-TER
, O
when O
a O
workforce B-TER
is O
vitally O
needed O
, O
it O
’s O
far O
better O
to O
put O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
within O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
. O

And O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
it O
seemed O
( O
after O
the O
Ostrava B-LOC
transport B-TER
to O
Nisko B-LOC
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1939 O
) O
that O
he O
had O
succeeded O
. O

While O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
in I-TER
Germany I-TER
and O
Austria B-TER
that O
was O
able O
to O
work B-TER
was O
deported B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-TER
, O
the O
transports B-TER
did O
n’t O
begin O
until O
October O
1941 O
. O

A O
special O
Jewish O
office O
within O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
religious I-ORG
community I-ORG
in I-ORG
Prague I-ORG
was O
established O
to O
allocate O
and O
guarantee O
Jews O
for O
labor B-TER
. O

When O
our O
efforts O
were O
thwarted O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
’ I-TER
desire O
to O
isolate O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
and O
to O
concentrate O
them O
, O
Edelstein B-PER
tried O
to O
at O
least O
ensure O
that O
this O
concentration O
would O
remain O
within O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
. O

This O
effort O
was O
seemingly O
effective O
. O

When O
a O
small O
group O
led O
by O
Edelstein B-PER
and O
Ing O
. O

Zuckr B-PER
went O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
on O
December O
1st O
, O
1941 O
, O
all O
were O
convinced O
that O
they O
would O
truly O
be O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
Protectorate I-TER
into O
Poland B-LOC
if O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
were O
to O
be O
established O
, O
as O
we O
thought O
at O
the O
time O
, O
as O
a O
Jewish O
town O
. O

Feverish O
preparations O
were O
already O
underway O
; O
plans O
were O
developed O
down O
to O
the O
smallest O
details O
and O
approved O
by O
the O
Office B-ORG
of I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Resettlement I-ORG
. O

But O
then O
everything O
turned O
out O
completely O
differently O
than O
we O
expected O
. O

We O
built O
a O
Jewish O
town O
– O
what O
an O
illusion O
! O
When O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
barracks O
closed O
behind O
us O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
we O
immediately O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
prison B-TER
than O
a O
Jewish O
town O
. O

It O
is O
n’t O
necessary O
to O
dwell O
more O
closely O
on O
the O
conditions O
at O
the O
time O
. O

When O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Günther B-PER
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
during O
the O
first O
few O
days O
and O
Edelstein B-PER
reproached O
him O
for O
deceiving O
us O
with O
false O
facts O
, O
he O
answered O
: O
Jetzt O
wenn O
Ihr O
i O
m O
Dreck O
sitzt O
Juden O
, O
zeigt O
was O
Ihr O
könnt O
! O
And O
we O
were O
determined O
to O
show O
what O
we O
are O
capable O
of O
. O

Our O
most O
important O
task O
was O
to O
use O
all O
of O
our O
strength O
to O
wake O
people O
up O
from O
their O
lethargy O
, O
maintain O
cleanliness O
to O
prevent O
diseases B-TER
, O
establish O
kitchens O
to O
ensure O
food B-TER
, O
acquire O
mattresses B-TER
and O
straw B-TER
mattresses I-TER
especially O
for O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
the O
children B-TER
, O
and O
work O
our O
way O
out O
of O
this O
mess O
in O
the O
literal O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
– O
without O
the O
means O
, O
but O
firmly O
believing O
that O
we O
could O
do O
it O
. O

And O
after O
the O
first O
terrible O
days O
of O
shock O
, O
mutual O
hatred O
, O
and O
bitterness O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
we O
had O
indeed O
succeeded O
. O

Somehow O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
carefree O
life O
set O
in O
. O

Every O
one O
of O
us O
had O
a O
place O
to O
sleep B-TER
and O
for O
his O
or O
her O
things O
, O
more O
or O
less O
had O
a O
job O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
: O
there O
was O
a O
peaceful O
atmosphere O
. O

This O
was O
one O
of O
Edelstein B-PER
’s I-PER
greatest O
achievements O
. O

He O
was O
truly O
able O
to O
gain O
the O
population B-TER
’s O
trust O
. O

The O
initial O
hatred O
of O
him O
and O
of O
his O
colleagues O
abated O
, O
and O
people O
started O
to O
like O
him O
. O

He O
gradually O
won O
over O
everyone O
’s O
heart O
. O

All O
of O
us O
trusted O
him O
, O
believed O
that O
he O
told O
the O
truth O
, O
that O
our O
affairs O
were O
his O
affairs O
as O
well O
and O
that O
he O
represented O
our O
interests O
before O
the O
Germans B-TER
as O
nobody O
else O
could O
. O

Everyone O
knew O
that O
they O
could O
come O
to O
Edelstein B-PER
with O
any O
worry O
or O
complaint O
, O
day O
or O
night O
. O

And O
the O
Germans B-TER
rightly O
knew O
that O
Edelstein B-PER
presented O
a O
danger O
to O
them O
and O
they O
feared O
him O
as O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
people O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
hard O
they O
tried O
, O
they O
never O
managed O
to O
create O
an O
insurmountable O
barrier O
between O
him O
and O
the O
people O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
’ I-TER
method O
was O
extremely O
transparent O
. O

Edelstein B-PER
often O
said O
: O
They O
want O
to O
give O
us O
all O
kinds O
of O
possible O
and O
impossible O
advantages O
to O
make O
us O
forget O
that O
I O
am O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
to O
make O
us O
feel O
an O
affiliation O
to O
them O
, O
and O
most O
of O
all O
they O
want O
to O
cultivate O
hatred O
for O
me O
in O
the O
people O
. O

A O
small O
example O
to O
illustrate O
this O
. O

Food B-TER
was O
cooked O
in O
a O
communal O
kitchen O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
demanded O
a O
separate O
kitchen O
for O
the O
leading O
coworkers O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Self B-TER
- I-TER
government I-TER
with O
the O
justification O
that O
even O
during O
military O
service O
officers O
take O
their O
meals O
separately O
from O
simple O
privates O
. O

Edelstein B-PER
refused O
and O
the O
answer O
was O
: O
Communist O
methods O
! O
Then O
January O
1942 O
arrived O
: O
the O
execution B-TER
of O
several O
inhabitants B-TER
of O
the O
camp O
for O
the O
barest O
of O
violations O
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
's I-LOC
rules O
. O

The B-TER
Council I-TER
of I-TER
Elders I-TER
, O
the O
Jewish O
commanders O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
members O
of O
the O
maintenance O
service O
, O
and O
police B-TER
officers I-TER
had O
to O
be O
present O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
Edelstein B-PER
was O
n’t O
present O
during O
the O
second O
wave O
of O
executions B-TER
. O

He O
announced O
that O
he O
would O
n’t O
look O
at O
them O
and O
demanded O
to O
be O
released O
from O
his O
position O
because O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
continue O
to O
be O
a O
Jewish B-TER
elder I-TER
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O

It O
was O
an O
exceptional O
act O
of O
personal O
bravery O
. O

His O
resignation O
was O
n’t O
accepted O
, O
but O
his O
status O
with O
the O
Germans B-TER
unsurprisingly O
did O
n’t O
improve O
. O

January O
also O
brought O
another O
terrible O
thing O
: O
the O
first O
transports B-TER
from I-TER
Theresienstadt I-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

All O
was O
in O
vain O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
’ I-TER
intention O
was O
solely O
to O
transport B-TER
Jews B-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
Protectorate I-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
through O
the O
transit B-TER
camp I-TER
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Why O
did O
we O
voluntarily O
go O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
? O
There O
was O
no O
time O
for O
such O
thoughts O
, O
we O
had O
to O
help O
in O
any O
way O
we O
could O
. O

And O
so O
we O
lost O
another O
illusion O
. O

How O
would O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
prevent O
the O
transports B-TER
? O
Edelstein B-PER
continued O
in O
his O
theory O
of O
the O
Jews O
as O
a O
workforce B-TER
. O

We O
must O
prove O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
Jews O
’ O
suitability B-TER
as I-TER
a I-TER
workforce I-TER
for O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
combat O
the O
intended O
concentration O
of O
Jews O
, O
we O
must O
send O
workers B-TER
to O
locations O
outside O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
receive O
commissions O
from O
Aryan B-TER
companies O
. O

We O
must O
establish O
workshops O
and O
factories O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

Hopefully O
, O
that O
would O
help O
us O
. O

It O
was O
an O
uneven O
battle O
against O
an O
opponent O
that O
outnumbered O
us O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
send O
a O
group O
of O
workers B-TER
to O
the O
mines O
in O
Kladno B-LOC
and O
Oslavany B-LOC
, O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
crew O
that O
constructed O
the O
road O
near O
České B-LOC
Budějovice I-LOC
, O
and O
to O
do O
forest O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Křivoklát B-LOC
region O
. O

Workshops O
and O
factories O
were O
created O
and O
we O
hoped O
that O
we O
were O
one O
step O
ahead O
. O

But O
not O
for O
long O
. O

The O
transports B-TER
continued O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
statistics B-TER
, O
diagrams O
, O
and O
written O
reports O
were O
composed O
and O
we O
continuously O
provided O
proof O
that O
there O
was O
such O
a O
shortage O
of O
workers B-TER
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
treat O
the O
sick B-TER
if O
other O
workers B-TER
were O
deported B-TER
to O
the O
east O
, O
and O
so O
contagions B-TER
that O
would O
threaten O
the O
entire O
surrounding O
area O
could O
emerge O
, O
etc O
. O

So O
many O
sleepless O
nights O
, O
so O
many O
reams O
of O
paper O
filled O
with O
writing O
, O
sophisticated O
statistical B-TER
calculations O
and O
yet O
no O
success O
, O
or O
only O
minimal O
success O
, O
as O
once O
Edelstein B-PER
was O
able O
to O
prevent O
a O
transport B-TER
and O
here O
and O
there O
gain O
a O
short O
delay O
. O

The O
spectre O
of O
the O
transports B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
hung O
over O
the O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
the O
elderly B-TER
ghetto B-LOC
, O
the O
settlement O
of O
prominent B-TER
persons I-TER
, O
and O
the O
other O
names O
of O
the O
phases O
of O
the O
development O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
and O
our O
work O
consisted O
in O
preventing O
the O
transports B-TER
or O
to O
at O
least O
gain O
some O
time O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
there O
was O
a O
new O
hope O
: O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1943 O
, O
shops O
and O
a O
cafe B-TER
were O
to O
be O
opened O
. O

What O
did O
this O
mean O
? O
Edelstein B-PER
knew O
the O
answer O
: O
We O
were O
to O
be O
items O
on O
display O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
they O
were O
n’t O
treating O
the O
Jews O
that O
poorly O
and O
present O
to O
the O
world O
the O
illusion O
of O
a O
Jewish O
town O
. O

We O
had O
to O
capitalize O
on O
this O
situation O
very O
carefully O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
already O
expecting O
the O
visit O
of O
an O
international B-ORG
committee I-ORG
. O

There O
was O
talk O
of O
having O
radio O
, O
making O
a O
film O
, O
and O
putting O
on O
a O
comedy O
for O
the O
foreign O
visit O
. O

But O
Edelstein B-PER
would O
never O
participate O
in O
this O
comedy O
. O

On O
November O
9th O
, O
1943 O
, O
Edelstein B-PER
was O
arrested B-TER
and O
accused O
of O
helping O
Jews O
escape B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
the O
enemy O
. O

The O
evidence O
: O
the O
census O
report O
did O
n’t O
match O
; O
there O
was O
an O
unexplained O
difference O
of O
about O
50 O
individuals O
. O

This O
was O
a O
hard O
time O
for O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

The O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
of O
the O
entire O
population B-TER
, O
including O
children B-TER
and O
the O
elderly B-TER
, O
in O
the O
Bohušovice B-LOC
basin I-LOC
lasted O
16 O
hours O
. O

There O
was O
an O
oppressive O
premonition O
of O
impending O
doom O
. O

The O
ghetto B-LOC
had O
no O
leadership B-TER
; O
there O
was O
no O
contact O
between O
the O
population B-TER
and O
the O
new O
leadership B-TER
; O
the O
inhabitants B-TER
did O
n’t O
trust O
their O
representatives O
. O

Edelstein B-PER
himself O
had O
no O
illusions O
about O
his O
fate O
. O

In O
December O
1943 O
, O
he O
was O
slated O
to O
be O
transported B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
with O
his O
family O
. O

His O
closest O
friends O
and O
colleagues O
once O
again O
volunteered O
to O
go O
with O
him O
. O

The O
Jewish O
warden O
who O
passed O
messages O
on O
to O
Edelstein B-PER
in O
prison B-TER
said O
that O
Edelstein B-PER
wept O
at O
hearing O
this O
proof O
of O
friendship O
, O
but O
resolutely O
forbade O
anyone O
to O
join O
him O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
learned O
confidentially O
that O
Edelstein B-PER
was O
sentenced O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
never O
learned O
more O
information O
other O
than O
that O
. O

After O
December O
, O
1943 O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
even O
more O
gray O
and O
dreary O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
of O
trust O
disappeared O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
along O
with O
Edelstein B-PER
. O

Many O
of O
his O
colleagues O
from O
the O
section O
he O
led O
left O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
he O
did O
; O
they O
were O
put O
on O
the O
list O
of O
persons O
to O
be O
transported B-TER
. O

Ever O
since O
that O
day O
we O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
there O
was O
no O
concept O
to O
anything O
anymore O
, O
that O
orders O
were O
simply O
dealt O
and O
fulfilled O
. O

Spring O
1944 O

Stadtverschönerung O
. O

We O
all O
still O
remember O
the O
craziness O
that O
was O
summer O
1944 O
. O

We O
founded O
orchards O
and O
green O
spaces O
, O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
homes I-TER
will O
all O
kinds O
of O
toys O
, O
a O

children B-TER
with O
a O

, O
a B-TER
home I-TER
for I-TER
the I-TER
elderly I-TER
, O
model O

rooms O
, O
a O
musical B-TER
pavilion O
, O

rooms I-TER
, O
and O

halls O
. O

All O
for O
the O
International B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

We O
ca O
n’t O
deny O
that O
we O
made O
use O
of O
these O
amenities O
ourselves O
and O
thereby O
a O
temporary O
period O
of O
relief O
set O
in O
. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
dance O
on O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
volcano O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
we O
learned O
that O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
Rahm B-PER
had O
sent O
a O
report O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
in O
which O
he O
alerted O
to O
the O
growing O
danger O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
because O
officers O
of O
various O
nationalities O
, O
especially O
Czech B-LOC
officers O
, O
were O
allegedly O
meeting O
in O
groups O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
that O
this O
accusation O
presented O
a O
great O
danger O
. O

Shortly O
thereafter O
, O
the O
officers O
were O
registered O
and O
then O
the O
so O
- O
called O
workers O
’ O
transports B-TER
began O
…… O
. O

On O
October O
28th O
, O
1944 O
, O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
looked O
like O
a O
graveyard O
. O

Everything O
was O
gray O
…… O
. O

A O
town O
without O
men B-TER
. O

The O
contrast O
with O
the O
hot O
summer O
was O
too O
stark O
; O
winter O
was O
upon O
us O
, O
and O
still O
there O
was O
no O
end O
to O
the O
war B-TER
in O
sight O
. O

What O
would O
happen O
to O
our O
men B-TER
, O
children B-TER
, O
and O
siblings O
? O
Would O
we O
ever O
see O
them O
again O
? O
And O
then O
there O
was O
the O
necessity O
to O
do O
all O
of O
the O
work B-TER
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in O
place O
of O
all O
of O
those O
who O
have O
gone O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
quarters B-TER
were O
uninhabitable O
for O
the O
number O
of O
suitcases O
left O
behind O
, O
useless O
things O
, O
and O
furniture O
that O
was O
no O
longer O
needed O
. O

It O
was O
necessary O
to O
clear O
out O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
living O
quarters B-TER
; O
the O
furniture O
had O
to O
be O
hauled O
away O
; O
loaded O
railway O
cars O
stood O
at O
the O
train O
station O
; O
we O
received O
an O
order O
to O
build O
buildings B-TER
; O
the O
sick B-TER
had O
to O
be O
transferred O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
etc O
. O

And O
only O
apathetic O
and O
desperate O
women B-TER
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
endure O
in O
order O
to O
see O
our O
family O
members O
again O
, O
and O
so O
women B-TER
started O
to O
perform O
the O
most O
difficult O
men B-TER
’s O
work B-TER
. O

Would O
our O
men B-TER
return O
, O
do O
you O
believe O
that O
? O
That O
was O
a O
question O
we O
asked O
ourselves O
a O
thousand O
times O
. O

They O
have O
to O
return O
. O

An O
illusion O
? O
In O
April O
, O
a O
rumor O
suddenly O
spread O
during O
the O
night O
that O
the O
the O
SS B-TER
have O
withdrawn O
and O
that O
we O
were O
now O
being O
handled O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

We O
sang O
throughout O
the O
night O
and O
praised O
the O
glory O
of O
the O
new O
Czechoslovak O
Republic O
. O

Until O
… O
…… O
armed O
SSmen B-TER
appeared O
. O

Was O
liberation B-TER
also O
just O
an O
illusion O
? O
Beginning O
on O
April O
20th O
, O
1945 O
, O
in O
just O
two O
days O
15,000 O
starving B-TER
, O
sick B-TER
, O
dying B-TER
wretched O
prisoners B-TER
from O
various O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
after O
a O
torturous O
hunger B-TER
and I-TER
death I-TER
march I-TER
. O

Everyone O
was O
out O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
searching O
among O
the O
terrifying O
figures O
for O
a O
familiar O
face O
in O
hope O
and O
fear O
. O

Terrible O
hours O
and O
even O
more O
terrible O
certainty O
. O

The O
last O
hope O
for O
the O
return O
of O
our O
men B-TER
, O
children B-TER
, O
and O
relatives O
disappeared O
…… O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
end O
of O
an O
illusion O
. O

A O
deep O
depression O
took O
hold O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
were O
thousands O
of O
people O
dying B-TER
and O
sick B-TER
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
pull O
ourselves O
together O
and O
help O
in O
order O
to O
save O
at O
least O
the O
remainder O
of O
those O
who O
had O
survived O
, O
using O
all O
of O
the O
strength O
we O
had O
left O
. O

On O
May O
8th O
, O
we O
were O
liberated B-TER
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

There O
was O
no O
real O
joy O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
no O
real O
jubilation O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
feeling O
– O
late O
, O
everything O
came O
too O
late O
. O

Only O
in O
books O
does O
liberation B-TER
arrive O
at O
the O
right O
time O
. O

Edelstein B-PER

concept O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
be O
an O
illusion O

if O
the O

half O
a O
year O

, O
most O
of O
the O

We O
marched O
past O
SS B-TER
Grupenführer O
Fidler O
, O
who O
took O
away O
all O
of O
our O
musical B-TER
instruments O
and O
any O
luggage O
that O
looked O
fancy O
. O

At O
6 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
we O
boarded O
a O
passenger O
train O
that O
departed O
from O
the O
Bubeneč B-LOC
train O
station O
at O
1 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

It O
traveled O
along O
a O
strange O
route O
through O
Dresden B-LOC
, O
Görlitz B-LOC
, O
Liegnitz B-LOC
, O
Vratislav B-LOC
, O
Lodz B-LOC
. O

Schupo B-ORG
accompanied O
us O
on O
this O
journey O
. O

The O
train O
ride O
lasted O
32 O
hours O
, O
and O
we O
were O
given O
water O
only O
once O
. O

We O
got O
out O
on O
some O
sort O
of O
provisional O
platform O
. O

We O
later O
learned O
that O
this O
was O
Lodz B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish O
police O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
on O
the O
ramp O
, O
and O
it O
split O
us O
into O
groups O
and O
took O
us O
to O
an O
empty O
school O
building B-TER
. O

There O
, O
136 O
people B-TER
were O
stuffed O
into O
a O
room B-TER
measuring O
6x6 O
meters O
. O

Our O
living B-TER
conditions O
improved O
, O
and O
thereafter O
78 O
people O
would O
stay O
in O
this O
room O
. O

We O
slept O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
soon O
became O
sick B-TER
with O
angina B-TER
. O

Right O
after O
I O
got O
better O
, O
my O
mother B-PER
came B-TER
down I-TER
with I-TER
pneumonia B-TER
. O

Because O
the O
hospitals B-TER
were O
too O
full O
, O
she O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
floor O
while O
she O
was O
sick B-TER
. O

The O
rainy O
autumn O
weather O
, O
the O
abnormal O
accommodations B-TER
, O
and O
the O
overcrowded O
living B-TER
conditions O
produced O
a O
lot O
filth O
and O
made O
many O
people O
sick B-TER
. O

After O
three O
weeks O
, O
we O
were O
all O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
and O
there O
was O
practically O
nothing O
we O
could O
do O
to O
prevent O
it O
. O

We O
ate B-TER
the O
last O
of O
the O
food B-TER
we O
brought O
with O
us O
and O
then O
went O
hungry O
. O

We O
received O
20 O
decagrams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
one O
soup B-TER
per O
day O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
Jews I-TER
did O
n’t O
help O
us O
, O
not O
a O
bit O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
get O
the O
fuel O
for O
heating O
that O
we O
were O
allotted O
and O
received O
less O
and O
worse O
kinds O
of O
potatoes B-TER
and O
vegetables B-TER
than O
they O
did O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
at O
night O
during O
the O
winter O
, O
and O
as O
a O
consequence O
my O
father B-PER
became O
ill B-TER
with O
phlegmon B-TER
and O
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
on O
5 O

1942 O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
as O
a O
blacksmith O
and O
my O
brother B-PER
as O
a O
leatherworker O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1942 O
, O
there O
were O
mass O
deportations O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
which O
emptied O
many O
apartments B-TER
, O
and O
the O
collectives O
were O
gradually O
shut O
down O
. O

In O
June O
1942 O
, O
we O
were O
given O
an O
apartment B-TER
. O

I O
contracted B-TER
a O
bad O
case O
of O
hepatitis B-TER
and O
I O
became O
severely O
weak O
. O

When O
I O
got O
better O
, O
I O
was O
assigned O
easier O
work B-TER
in O
a O
factory O
that O
manufactured O
wooden O
products O
. O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
25,000 O
Jews O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
were O
sent O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

My O
mother B-PER
was O
also O
supposed O
to O
be O
transported B-TER
, O
but O
I O
bribed O
the O
Jewish O
police O
, O
and O
so O
I O
managed O
to O
free O
my O
mother B-PER
. O

But O
her O
mental O
and O
physical O
condition O
was O
very O
poor O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
she O
died B-TER
on O
12 O
. O

10 O
. O

1942 O
. O

My O
brother B-PER
, O
who O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
tied O
to O
a O
bed O
with O
serious O
tuberculosis B-TER
, O
died B-TER
after O
having O
suffered O
greatly O
on O
19 O
. O

11 O
. O

1942 O
. O

I O
buried B-TER
the O
3 O
closest O
and O
dearest O
people O
to O
me O
according O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
funeral I-TER
custom I-TER
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
time O
for O
me O
. O

After O
an O
11 O
hour O
work B-TER
shift O
, O
I O
had O
to O
wash O
my O
own O
laundry O
, O
cook O
my O
own O
meals O
, O
and O
, O
worse O
, O
do O
my O
own O
shopping O
. O

I O
sold O
everything O
that O
I O
had O
, O
I O
earned O
my O
living O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
I O
supported O
myself O
. O

In O
the O
autumn O
of O
1943 O
we O
were O
given O
permission O
to O
send O
parcels B-TER
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

I O
received O
a O
parcel B-TER
from O
my O
friend O
Heinz B-PER
Prossnitz I-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC
every O
week O
, O
which O
elevated O
my O
spirits O
as O
well O
as O
made O
me O
feel O
good O
physically O
. O

The O
liquidation O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
began O
in O
May O
1944 O
, O
since O
the O
front O
was O
advancing O
. O

But O
we O
did O
n’t O
know O
that O
the O
line O
of O
attack O
stopped O
at O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

Because O
we O
believed O
that O
the O
Red B-TER
Army I-TER
would O
arrive O
soon O
, O
we O
ignored O
the O
order O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
hid B-TER
. O

Neither O
machine O
guns O
, O
nor O
any O
other O
harsh O
measures O
against O
us O
could O
n’t O
force O
us O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
hungry O
and O
this O
forced O
us O
to O
report O
ourselves O
for O
transport B-TER
. O

On O
June O
22nd O
, O
1944 O
, O
we O
left O
Lodz B-LOC
in O
a O
cattle O
car O
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
a O
place O
where O
the O
first O
thing O
we O
saw O
were O
giant O
chimneys B-TER
with O
tall O
flames O
shooting O
up O
from O
them O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
by O
prisoners B-TER
in O
prison B-TER
garb O
and O
when O
I O
asked O
them O
what O
is O
being O
produced O
in O
the O
factories O
, O
they O
replied O
with O
ironic O
smiles O
: O
chocolate O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
believe O
that O
, O
but O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
our O
fathers O
, O
mothers O
, O
and O
children O
were O
being O
burnt B-TER
in O
them O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
near I-LOC
Auschwitz I-LOC
. O

After O
the O
selection B-TER
process O
, O
we O
were O
sent O
to O
work O
as O
expert O
mechanics O
and O
dismantled O
airplanes O
that O
had O
been O
shot O
down O
. O

Camp B-TER
life O
, O
as O
has O
often O
been O
described O
, O
set O
in O
. O

I O
witnessed O
terrible O
things O
. O

Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Slovak B-TER
, O
and O
Theresienstadt B-TER
transports I-TER
arrived O
. O

This O
lasted O
until O
January O
1945 O
. O

The O
Russians B-TER
once O
again O
attacked O
near O
Krakow B-LOC
and O
threatened O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
evacuated B-TER
on O
January O
18th O
. O

The O
train O
connection O
did O
n’t O
exist O
any O
longer O
and O
so O
we O
set O
out O
in O
wooden O
shoes O
with O
blankets O
and O
one O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
. O

We O
walked B-TER
all O
night O
and O
day O
and O
our O
strength O
disappeared O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
left O
was O
our O
will O
and O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
liberated B-TER
soon O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies O
of O
those O
who O
marched B-TER
before O
us O
and O
had O
already O
died B-TER
lay O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
fourth O
day O
, O
we O
boarded O
a O
train O
somewhere O
near O
Katowice B-LOC
. O

They O
squeezed O
120 O
of O
us O
into O
one O
open O
car O
and O
, O
without O
giving O
us O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
we O
rode O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
4 O
nights O
. O

We O
were O
numb O
, O
like O
animals O
. O

In O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
and O
Přerov B-LOC
, O
the O
inhabitants O
gave O
us O
some O
food B-TER
. O

The O
SS B-TER
shot O
at O
them O
, O
but O
this O
did O
n’t O
stop O
them O
and O
they O
helped O
us O
however O
they O
could O
. O

On O
27 O
. O

1 O
. O

1945 O
, O
our O
death B-TER
transport O
ended O
in O
Mauthausen B-LOC
near O
Linz B-LOC
. O

Without O
getting O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
they O
sent O
us O
off O
to O
the O
hot O
showers O
and O
then O
they O
made O
us O
run O
naked O
and O
wet O
into O
an O
ice O
storm O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
hours O
until O
they O
let O
us O
into O
the O
block B-TER
. O

There O
were O
1,200 O
people B-TER
in O
the O
building B-TER
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
sleep O
for O
4 O
weeks O
. O

The O
Czechs O
there O
stuck O
together O
and O
helped O
us O
get O
food B-TER
whenever O
possible O
. O

In O
February O
1945 O
, O
I O
was O
transported B-TER
to O
Gusen B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
ever O
suffered O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
underground O
Messerschmitt O
airplane O
factory O
under O
terrible O
conditions B-TER
: O
not O
enough O
food B-TER
, O
little O
sleep O
, O
dirt O
, O
back O
- O
breaking O
and O
long O
labor B-TER
, O
bad O
air O
, O
beatings O
, O
and O
cold O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
go O
into O
the O
details O
, O
just O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
3 O
months O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
take O
up O
a O
whole O
new O
workforce B-TER
because O
the O
previous O
one O
died B-TER
a O
natural O
death B-TER
is O
enough O
. O

This O
means O
that O
in O
each O
block O
, O
which O
had O
800 O
people B-TER
, O
an O
average O
of O
10 O
prisoners B-TER
died B-TER
every O
day O
. O

When O
I O
was O
at O
my O
worst O
, O
when O
my O
strength O
was O
starting O
to O
leave O
me O
, O
we O
were O
liberated B-TER
: O
on O
May O
5th O
the O
Americans B-TER
disarmed O
our O
guards O
and O
all O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
left O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
found O
shelter O
in O
the O
Czech O
civilian O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Linz B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
quickly O
recovered O
. O

On O
May O
18th O
, O
1945 O
, O
I O
returned O
to O
Prague B-LOC

None O

almost O
all O

move O
into O
very O
nice O
buildings B-TER
. O

After O
their O
work B-TER
in O
Schleuse B-TER
is O
done O
, O
the O
women B-TER
go O
to O
the O
forest O
to O
chop B-TER
down O
trees O
and O
tear B-TER
down I-TER
old O
buildings O
. O

The O
work B-TER
is O
very O
hard O
. O

In O
August O
1943 O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
women B-TER
leave O
for O
Tallinn B-LOC
; O
the O
camp B-TER
is O
liquidated O
. O

Before O
we O
leave O
, O
most O
of O
our O
things O
are O
taken O
away O
from O
us O
. O

In O
Tallinn B-LOC
, O
we O
live B-TER
in O
the O
central O
prison B-TER
, O
where O
we O
meet O
up O
with O
the O
first O
transport B-TER
, O
and O
work B-TER
together O
doing O
cleaning O
work B-TER
in O
the O
port O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
the O
OT B-ORG

Here O
, O
we O
see O
the O
men B-TER
from O
our O
transport B-TER
who O
also O
return O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
after O
their O
work B-TER
is O
done O
. O

The O
food B-TER
in O
prison B-TER
is O
terrible O
, O
but O
we O
can O
sometimes O
procure O
something O
for O
ourselves O
. O

In O
December O
1943 O
, O
all O
of O
the O
women B-TER
leave O
Tallinn B-LOC
and O
go O
to O
EREDA B-LOC
( O
about O
30 O
km O
from O
Narva B-LOC
) O
. O

The O
men B-TER
remain O
in O
Tallinn B-LOC
, O
and O
this O
is O
where O
we O
last O
hear O
from O
them O
in O
March O
1944 O
. O

Ereda B-LOC
is O
a O
small O
camp B-TER
. O

It O
already O
houses O
about O
1,000 O
Jews O
from O
Lithuania B-LOC
( O
Vilnius B-LOC

Kovno B-LOC
) O
and O
Latvia B-LOC

They O
are O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
and O
without O
their O

In O
the O
surrounding O
area O
, O
there O
are O
several O
other O
similar O
camps B-TER

There O
are O
also O
several O
Czechs B-TER
there O
, O
arriving O
from O
Riga B-LOC

The O
SS B-TER
has O
already O
taken O
leadership O
of O
it O
; O
guards O
are O
Est B-LOC

and O
O.T. B-ORG
The O
food B-TER
is O
bad O
, O
but O
we O
have O
the O
option O
to O
obtain O
things O
for O
ourselves O
, O
but O
only O
the O
fearless O
among O
us O
attempt O
this O
. O

We O
work B-TER
in O
the O
forest O
and O
on O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
new O
camp B-TER
a O
few O
km O
away O
. O

There O
is O
typhus B-TER
; O
there O
are O
sick B-TER
people I-TER
; O
the B-TER
elderly I-TER
and O
children B-TER
are O
constantly O
sent O
away O
( O
most O
likely O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC

. O

When O
the O
Russians B-ORG
approach O
( O
in O
July O
1944 O
) O
, O
we O
depart O
for O
Tallinn B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
boat O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
waiting O
for O
us O
. O

It O
’s O
not O
there O
, O
and O
so O
we O
go O
to O
a O
suburb O
of O
Tallinn B-LOC
to O
a O
large O
meadow O
, O
where O
we O
stay O
for O
three O
weeks O
with O
no O
shelter B-TER
. O

We O
dig B-TER
trenches I-TER
. O

There O
is O
famine B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER

In O
August O
, O
we O
finally O
sail O
to O
Germany B-LOC

We O
sail O
for O
five O
days O
without O
food B-TER

We O
arrive O
in O
Danzig B-LOC
and O
sail O
down O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
to O
Stutthof B-LOC

There O
, O
we O
are O
sent O
to O
the O

, O
our O
belongings O
are O
taken O
away O
, O
and O
we O
are O
given O
new O

Our O
hair O
was O
already O
cut O
before O
we O
left O
Estonia B-LOC

Women B-TER

Hamburg B-LOC
after O
three O
weeks O

for O

the O
final O
moments O
of O
your O
true O
hero O
in O
life O

This O
roughly O
31 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
athlete O
in O
body O
and O
spirit O
, O
whose O
politically O
active O
brother B-TER
was O
killed O
by O
the O
occupiers O
, O
was O
originally O
a O
builder O
, O
but O
spent O
long O
months O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
Ghetto I-LOC
working O
as O
a O
cook B-TER
and O
, O
later O
, O
due O
to O
his O
skillfulness O
, O
as O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
work B-TER
group O
. O

Beloved O
by O
all O
of O
his O
fellow B-TER
prisoners I-TER
for O
his O
honesty O
, O
skill O
as O
a O
worker O
, O
and O
, O
last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
for O
his O
great O
sense O
of O
fairness O
, O
he O
is O
departing O
on O
a O
transport B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
now O
. O

Once O
there O
, O
he O
is O
selected B-TER
from O
the O
thousands O
of O
the O
strongest O
to O
leave O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
leaving O
his O
mother O
to O
an O
uncertain O
fate O
along O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
11,000 O
prisoners B-TER
, O
10,500 O
of O
whom O
will O
be O
executed B-TER
in I-TER
the I-TER
gas I-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

In O
the O
Schwarzheide B-LOC
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
near O
Oranienburg B-LOC
, O
firmly O
believing O
in O
the O
victory O
of O
the O
allies B-TER
, O
he O
works B-TER
for O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
except O
for O
the O
hours O
spent O
in O
attendance O
at O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
and O
on O
the O
way O
to O
work B-TER
. O

His O
strong O
athlete O
’s O
body O
holds O
out O
against O
unbearable O
suffering O
, O
back O
- O
breaking O
work B-TER
, O
and O
hunger B-TER
, O
and O
he O
outlives O
many O
of O
his O
friends O
who O
are O
dying B-TER
from O
starvation B-TER
and O
torture O
. O

He O
rejoices O
over O
, O
and O
suffers O
as O
a O
result O
of O
, O
the O
countless O
airstrikes B-TER
that O
we O
experience O
in O
the O
synthetic O
gasoline O
factory B-TER
. O

Although O
we O
have O
built O
many O
multi O
- O
storeyed O
shelters O
with O
3 O
meter O
reinforced O
concrete O
ceilings O
, O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
out O
the O
bombings B-TER
close O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
inside O
wooden O
buildings O
that O
are O
subjected O
to O
frequent O
hits O
. O

The O
bombs B-TER
that O
strike O
here O
injure O
comrade O
Honza B-PER
so O
slightly O
that O
he O
recovers O
in O
several O
months O
and O
is O
once O
more O
sent O
off O
to O
become O
part O
of O
a O
work B-TER
group O
whose O
sole O
purpose O
is O
to O
completely O
exhaust O
the O
workers O
. O

He O
solemnly O
swears O
revenge O
upon O
those O
who O
ignored O
his O
injuries O
and O
sent O
him O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

More O
air B-TER
strikes I-TER
land O
and O
we O
are O
the O
victims O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
’ O
brutality O
. O

During O
the O
last O
airstrike B-TER
, O
comrade O
Honza B-PER
leaves O
the O
room O
in O
which O
we O
eat B-TER
and O
goes O
to O
the O
room O
where O
we O
sleep O
. O

He O
wants O
to O
escape O
the O
thought O
that O
he O
could O
be O
hit O
again O
. O

The O
bomb B-TER
falls O
several O
meters O
from O
our O
wooden O
building O
, O
and O
many O
shards O
bounce O
off O
the O
concrete O
slabs O
of O
the O
washroom O
that O
has O
been O
reduced O
to O
dust O
and O
strike O
dozens O
of O
prisoners B-TER
who O
are O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
house O
. O

Our O
Honza B-PER
is O
among O
the O
unfortunate O
ones O
. O

Shrapnel O
has O
sliced O
his O
leg O
open O
close O
to O
the O
groin O
. O

Everyone O
is O
heavily O
wounded O
. O

A O
punctured O
stomach O
, O
a O
ripped O
up O
back O
, O
a O
sliced O
off O
hand O
, O
and O
much O
worse O
. O

We O
rush O
to O
Honza B-PER
’s O
side O
. O

We O
want O
to O
wrap O
him O
in O
a O
blanket O
and O
carry O
him O
off O
to O
the O
sickroom B-TER
. O

Honza B-PER
refuses O
, O
and O
tells O
us O
to O
take O
those O
with O
lighter O
injuries O
who O
can O
still O
be O
helped O
. O

He O
points O
our O
attention O
to O
his O
significant O
blood O
loss O
, O
hopeless O
condition O
, O
his O
maimed O
body O
. O

This O
shows O
what O
a O
great O
man O
he O
truly O
was O
. O

His O
selflessness O
is O
a O
quality O
one O
would O
be O
hard O
- O
pressed O
to O
find O
here O
above O
this O
tomb B-TER
of O
thousands O
and O
millions O
of O
people O
. O

It O
made O
us O
shiver O
to O
hear O
his O
words O
of O
eternal O
, O
incomprehensibly O
great O
friendship O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
I O
exaggerate O
when O
I O
state O
that O
such O
brotherhood O
is O
described O
only O
in O
the O
Bible O
. O

Our O
friend O
passed B-TER
away I-TER
3 O
days O
later O
and O
left O
us O
with O
an O
everlasting O
memory O
– O
a O
symbol O
of O
humanity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
vigilance O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
those O
who O
caused O
these O
atrocities O
do O
not O
go O
unpunished O
. O

Although O
he O
helped O
build O
the O
medical O
shelters O
that O
were O
5 O
minutes O
away O
from O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
leaving O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
himself O
there O
every O
day O
, O
our O
Honza B-PER
is O
taken O
to O
a O
wholly O
unfit O
wooden O
hut O
. O

Here O
, O
a O
medical B-TER
attendant I-TER
, O
a O
German O
surgeon B-TER
, O
operates O
on O
him O
. O

Prisoners B-TER
are O
only O
allowed O
to O
assist O
and O
stitch O
up O
heavy O
wounds O
using O
a O
plain O
needle O
used O
to O
sew O
bags O
. O

The O
medical B-TER
attendant I-TER
operates O
with O
a O
regular O
wood O
saw O
from O
the O
camp B-TER
’s O
joinery O
workshop O
, O
and O
dozens O
of O
our O
friends O

victims O
of O
the O

die B-TER
after O
going O
through O
indescribable O
agony O
alongside O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
others O
worked O
and O

May O
they O
rest O

In O

at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

the O

allowed O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
gradual O
occupation O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
by O
the O
German B-TER

I O
escaped B-TER

the O

I O

When O
the O

approached O
Banská B-LOC
Bystrica I-LOC
, O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
mountains O

After O
wandering O
aimlessly O
for O
three O
whole O
days O

1944 O
. O

German B-TER
SSmen B-TER
gathered O
all O
of O
us O
together O
in O
a O
meadow O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
were O
Jews O
. O

Those O
who O
could O
provide O
papers O
proving O
they O
were O
Aryan B-TER
were O
released O

The O
Jews O
were O
told O
to O
immediately O
hand O
over O
their O
watches O
, O
money O
, O
and O
all O
of O
the O
valuables O
that O
they O
had O
on O
them O

The O
SSmen B-TER
told O
us O
that O
we O
would O
no O
longer O
need O
them O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
leader O
ordered O
us O
to O
be O
transported O
and O
notified O
us O
that O
a O
patrol O
of O
2 O
soldiers B-TER
would O
accompany O
us O
, O
promising O
that O
nothing O
would O
happen O
to O
us O

On O
our O
way O
down O
from O
the O
mountains O
, O
we O
were O
joined O
by O
4 O
more O
SSmen B-TER
, O
so O
there O
was O
a O
total O
of O
6 O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
a O
meadow O
where O
the O
SSmen B-TER
hung O
back O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
walk O
toward O
Banská B-LOC
Bystrica I-LOC
and O
to O
stay O
together O
. O

After O
we O
had O
gone O
forward O
for O
about O
10 O
steps O

they O
began O
to O
shoot O
us O
in O
the O
back O
. O

They O
fired O
until O
everyone O
( O
42 O
people O
) O
lay O
dead B-TER
or O
half O

dead O

They O
then O
examined O
each O
body O

took O
whatever O
they O
liked O
, O
and O
murdered B-TER
anyone O
who O
was O

dead B-TER

with O
a O

the O

in O
the O

Auschwitz B-LOC

Gleiwitz B-LOC
and O

concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

On O
28.09.1944 O
we O
were O
loaded O
( O
1st O
transport B-TER
) O
in O
Terezín B-LOC
and O
went O
with O
the O
strong O
opinion O
, O
that O
we O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
Germany B-TER
to O
work B-TER
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Bautzen B-LOC
we O
became O
much O
more O
unsure O
about O
the O
destination O
. O

In O
Görlitz B-LOC
already O
we O
were O
all O
agreed O
, O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
more O
or O
less O
famous O
Birkenau B-LOC
Ghetto O
. O

The O
only O
other O
was O
out O
, O
was O
that O
we O
would O
end O
up O
in O
the O
Glatzer O
coal O
mines O
. O

The O
hope O
became O
weaker O
and O
weaker O
, O
and O
as O
we O
finally O
arrived O
in O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
was O
completely O
gone O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
a O
large O
, O
open O
train O
station O
tracks O
when O
suddenly O
the O
doors O
burst O
violently O
open O
and O
we O
heard O
only O
these O
words O
: O
Everybody O
out O
, O
luggage O
stays O
in O
the O
carriage O
. O

The O
first O
things O
that O
we O
saw O
was O
electrified O
barbed O
wire O
on O
both O
sides O
with O
electric O
lamps O
every O
5 O
meters O
. O

Further O
away O
, O
we O
saw O
a O
chimney O
, O
that O
had O
a O
giant O
red O
flam O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
. O

It O
was O
– O
we O
would O
later O
discover O
– O
one O
of O
the O
five O
furnaces B-TER
, O
that O
worked B-TER
night O
and O
day O
. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
annihilation B-TER
and O
concentration B-TER
camp O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
line O
up O
in O
fives O
alongside O
the O
train O
and O
were O
shown O
to O
a O
big O
, O
strong O
SS B-TER
-Hauptsturmführer O
who O
sorted O
us O
. O

( O
Dr. O
Schwarz B-PER
) O
The O
weak O
, O
ill B-TER
, O
elderly O
and O
those O
younger O
than O
14 O
- O
16 O
years O
were O
led O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
the O
left O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
were O
left O
( O
from O
the O
transport B-TER
of O
2500 O
, O
1100 O
were O
left O
) O
went O
to O
camp B-TER
on O
the O
right O
. O

Now O
that O
we O
had O
arrived O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
SS B-TER
told O
us O
that O
this O
camp B-TER
is O
the O
Auschwitz B-LOC
camp O
, O
that O
people B-TER
who O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
work B-TER
are O
gassed B-TER
here O
, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
us O
is O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
work B-TER
, O
and O
that O
we O
would O
get O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

We O
were O
led O
into O
the O
sauna O
, O
undressed O
completely O
, O
shaved O
, O
bathed O
and O
got O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

The O
clothes B-TER
were O
the O
German B-TER
prison B-TER
uniform O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
led O
into O
the O
actual O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
was O
divided O
into O
two O
barracks B-TER
and O
the O
camp B-TER
senior O
– O
a O
German B-TER
felon O
– O
explained O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
to O
us O
. O

When O
this O
was O
finished O
, O
we O
were O
chased O
out O
of O
the O
block O
in O
order O
to O
spend O
the O
long O
, O
beautiful O
day O
outside O
. O

At O
1PM O
we O
got O
our O
first O
meal B-TER
. O

It O
was O
¾ O
of O
a O
litre O
of O
pumpkin B-TER
soup I-TER
that O
was O
inedible O
for O
a O
cultivated O
person O
. O

But O
we O
were O
starving B-TER
and O
when O
a O
person O
is O
hungry B-TER
, O
he O
will O
eat B-TER
everything O
. O

This O
amazing O
lunch B-TER
was O
given O
to O
us O
in O
dirty O
bowls O
, O
or O
if O
you O
were O
especially O
lucky O
, O
in O
washing O
bowls O
. O

Altogether O
, O
there O
was O
about O
30 O
bowls O
available O
for O
1000 O
people B-TER
. O

The O
meal B-TER
had O
to O
be O
finished O
with O
30 O
minutes O
. O

Spoons O
, O
or O
other O
such O
items O
used O
by O
people B-TER
daily O
, O
were O
a O
rarity O
for O
us O
and O
none O
of O
us O
thought O
about O
them O
anymore O
. O

And O
so O
, O
we O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
outside O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
until O
at O
about O
7PM O
when O
there O
was O
dinner B-TER
. O

This O
consisted O
of O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
a O
spoonful O
of O
marmalade B-TER
and O
a O
slice O
of O
sausage B-TER
that O
could O
only O
be O
seen O
through O
a O
magnifying O
glass O
. O

After O
this O
extensive O
evening O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
were O
chases O
into O
the O
barracks B-TER
in O
order O
to O
sleep O
. O

However O
, O
what O
one O
usually O
understands O
as O
sleep O
and O
lying O
down O
of O
course O
did O
n’t O
apply O
here O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
sat O
on O
a O
freezing O
cold O
, O
concrete O
floor O
and O
fought O
over O
space O
until O
one O
or O
another O
fell O
asleep O
more O
or O
less O
tired O
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
forced O
out O
of O
these O
wonderful O
four O
- O
poster O
beds O
and O
the O
terrible O
, O
new O
and O
oh O
so O
long O
day O
would O
begin O
. O

Three O
times O
a O
day O
we O
had O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
so O
that O
nobody O
could O
escape B-TER
and O
tell O
the O
world O
how O
nice O
, O
wonderful O
and O
cultivated O
life O
was O
under O
the O
liberators O
of O
Europe O
. O

It O
went O
on O
like O
this O
for O
six O
days O
, O
until O
we O
were O
finally O
allocated O
to O
a O
work B-TER
transport I-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
nobody O
knew O
where O
it O
was O
going O
, O
the O
main O
thing O
was O
getting O
out O
of O
this O
inferno O
of O
death O
and O
the O
Devil O
. O

After O
we O
got O
new O
clothes B-TER
and O
were O
bathed O
clean O
, O
we O
were O
brought O
to O
a O
train O
station O
– O
envied O
by O
those O
who O
had O
to O
stay O
behind O
– O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
our O
new O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
travelled O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
until O
we O
arrived O
at O
our O
destination O
at O
about O
11PM O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
in O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
a O
camp B-TER
, O
given O
our O
first O
good O
soup O
and O
sent O
to O
bed O
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
awoken O
and O
presented O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

We O
heard O
now O
officially O
that O
we O
were O
in O
the O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
Gleiwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
, O
which O
belonged O
to O
the O
RAW B-ORG
( I-ORG
Reich I-ORG
Railway I-ORG
Improvement I-ORG
Works I-ORG
) I-ORG
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
work B-TER
that O
factory O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
Camp B-TER
Commandant O
Moll B-PER
explained O
to O
us O
that O
we O
would O
have O
it O
good O
– O
good O
food B-TER
, O
work B-TER
, O
treatment O
– O
as O
long O
as O
we O
were O
prepared O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
should O
n’t O
be O
bothered O
by O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
electric O
fence O
. O

The O
very O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory O
. O

The O
food B-TER
really O
was O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
got O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
20 O
g O
of O
margarine B-TER
; O
midday O
we O
got O
¼ O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
from O
beets B-TER
and O
water O
, O
apart O
from O
Sundays O
when O
we O
had O
potato B-TER
soup I-TER
; O
and O
evenings O
again O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
50 O
g O
of O
salami B-TER
. O

But O
the O
work B-TER
was O
for O
many O
people B-TER
strenuous O
. O

It O
was O
also O
very O
dirty O
work B-TER
, O
and O
on O
top O
of O
all O
that O
there O
was O
the O
harassment O
from O
the O
master O
( O
German B-TER
) O
, O
for O
whom O
we O
were O
just O
cattle O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
the O
very O
little O
sleep O
that O
we O
got O
at O
night O
and O
the O
long O
hours O
we O
worked B-TER
with O
only O
half O
an O
hour O
lunch O
break O
. O

A O
normal O
person O
who O
does O
n’t O
have O
the O
strength O
of O
horse O
ca O
n’t O
endure O
it O
. O

After O
we O
got O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
from O
work B-TER
, O
we O
were O
tormented O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
Capos B-TER
and O
block B-TER
seniors I-TER
until O
9PM O
. O

And O
so O
we O
lived O
from O
one O
day O
to O
the O
next O
, O
every O
second O
Sunday O
should O
be O
free O
from O
2PM O
. O

For O
us O
it O
looked O
like O
we O
had O
to O
carry O
stones O
from O
the O
outside O
the O
whole O
morning O
long O
. O

Even O
the O
people O
running O
the O
camp B-TER
did O
n’t O
know O
why O
. O

It O
was O
just O
harassment O
. O

Thank O
God O
that O
time O
passed O
and O
it O
was O
soon O
Christmas O
. O

Eight O
days O
before O
we O
were O
told O
that O
if O
we O
behave O
ourselves O
and O
there O
were O
no O
complaints O
from O
the O
factory O
about O
laziness O
amongst O
the O
prisoners B-TER
, O
then O
at O
Christmas O
we O
would O
get O
two O
full O
days O
off O
. O

We O
would O
also O
get O
better O
food B-TER
. O

Christmas O
came O
and O
we O
really O
did O
get O
the O
first O
day O
off O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
thick O
potato B-TER
soup I-TER
and O
cooked O
potatoes B-TER
. O

The O
second O
day O
did O
n’t O
go O
quite O
so O
peacefully O
. O

We O
were O
lying O
in O
bed O
as O
the O
camp B-TER
senior I-TER
came O
in O
and O
all O
hell O
broke O
loose O
. O

The O
place O
looked O
like O
a O
pigsty O
. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
was O
announced O
and O
as O
punishment O
, O
carrying O
stones O
was O
ordered O
. O

We O
carried O
stones O
until O
3PM O
and O
then O
we O
stood O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
until O
5PM O
, O
during O
which O
the O
dirtiest O
were O
sought O
out O
and O
punished O
with O
a O
beating O
. O

At O
5.30PM O
, O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
lunch B-TER
and O
then O
immediately O
afterwards O
our O
evening B-TER
meal I-TER
and O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
completely O
exhausted O
and O
battered O
. O

That O
’s O
what O
the O
two O
free O
days O
at O
Christmas O
looked O
like O
for O
us O
. O

But O
, O
we O
were O
already O
used O
to O
such O
things O
. O

What O
can O
you O
expect O
of O
such O
beastly O
creatures O
as O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
? O
It O
was O
almost O
New O
Year O
. O

The O
German B-TER
camp B-TER
management O
wanted O
again O
to O
appear O
human O
and O
let O
us O
have O
the O
day O
off O
. O

I O
think O
it O
probably O
better O
to O
say O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
the O
day O
off O
and O
to O
do O
that O
of O
course O
they O
had O
to O
give O
us O
the O
day O
off O
. O

The O
new O
year O
began O
. O

What O
troubles O
would O
it O
bring O
for O
us O
? O
Nobody O
knew O
. O

But O
look O
, O
it O
began O
well O
. O

Our O
camp B-TER
commandant O
Moll B-PER
, O
formerly O
the O
head O
of O
the O
annihilation B-TER
chambers I-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
was O
transferred O
to O
Buna B-LOC
- I-LOC
Monowitz I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
got O
a O
new O
one O
. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
promising O
. O

He O
held O
a O
speech O
in O
which O
– O
amongst O
other O
things O
– O
he O
pronounced O
that O
under O
him O
, O
there O
was O
no O
work B-TER
on O
Sundays O
, O
that O
the O
food B-TER
would O
be O
improved O
and O
that O
better O
care O
would O
be O
provided O
for O
the O
many O
people B-TER
who O
were O
ill B-TER
. O

We O
breathed O
a O
little O
easier O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
he O
was O
not O
like O
Moll B-PER
, O
and O
pretended O
at O
least O
that O
he O
had O
good O
intentions O
. O

How O
well O
he O
would O
deliver O
them O
, O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

And O
the O
next O
Sunday O
we O
really O
did O
get O
off O
. O

And O
once O
there O
was O
milk B-TER
. O

But O
none O
of O
it O
lasted O
very O
long O
. O

On O
the O
18th O
of O
January O
, O
the O
shift O
coming O
back O
from O
the O
factory O
told O
those O
of O
us O
who O
were O
ill B-TER
in O
bed O
, O
that O
the O
factory O
was O
being O
dismantled O
because O
of O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

This O
hit O
us O
like O
a O
bomb O
. O

And O
the O
question O
quickly O
arose O
of O
what O
would O
be O
done O
with O
us O
. O

There O
were O
three O
possibilities O
: O
1 O
shoot B-TER
us I-TER
, O
2 O
leave O
us O
to O
the O
Russians B-ORG
, O
3 O
evacuation B-TER
to O
the O
not O
yet O
occupied O
Germany B-TER
. O

There O
was O
much O
commotion O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Nobody O
new O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
next O
hours O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
at O
4PM O
, O
we O
were O
given O
our O
evening B-TER
meal I-TER
and O
sent O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
were O
expecting O
an O
unexpectedly O
quick O
decampment B-TER
. O

And O
then O
, O
at O
midnight O
we O
were O
woken O
up O
and O
told O
to O
get O
ready O
and O
at O
6AM O
we O
started O
out O
. O

Even O
the O
SS B-TER
guards I-TER
did O
n’t O
know O
where O
we O
were O
going O
. O

We O
had O
about O
1.5 O
kg O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
1/2 O
kg O
of O
margarine B-TER
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
our O
food B-TER
for O
three O
days O
. O

We O
started O
marching B-TER
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
have O
the O
slightest O
ideas O
how O
long O
we O
would O
be O
marching B-TER
for O
. O

After O
we O
had O
walked O
six O
hours O
through O
snow O
and O
ice O
without O
rest O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
we O
still O
had O
37 O
km O
to O
go O
until O
we O
would O
get O
our O
first O
break O
. O

We O
were O
all O
Muselmänner O
[ O
walking O
skeletons O
] O
and O
knew O
that O
even O
if O
any O
of O
us O
were O
even O
capable O
of O
doing O
it O
, O
we O
would O
have O
to O
march B-TER
into O
the O
night O
. O

Every O
so O
often O
, O
someone O
would O
collapse O
and O
then O
the O
SS B-TER
would O
shoot B-TER
them O
. O

And O
so O
we O
went O
, O
on O
and O
on O
to O
Germany B-TER
. O

And O
then O
suddenly O
, O
at O
about O
1AM O
, O
there O
appeared O
a O
camp O
before O
us O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
more O
than O
1000 O
men B-TER
were O
thrust O
into O
not O
very O
large O
barracks B-TER
. O

It O
was O
n’t O
possible O
to O
properly O
lie O
down O
, O
and O
barely O
possible O
to O
stand O
. O

People O
were O
sitting O
on O
each O
other O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
. O

In O
one O
camp B-TER
, O
( O
Jakobswalde B-LOC
) O
, O
we O
stayed O
until O
11AM O
the O
next O
day O
only O
to O
begin O
marching B-TER
again O
. O

We O
started O
marching B-TER
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

But O
we O
noticed O
that O
something O
was O
n’t O
right O
. O

Things O
were O
going O
badly O
behind O
the O
front O
. O

We O
marched B-TER
at O
a O
brisk O
pace O
and O
without O
a O
break O
for O
twelve O
hours O
and O
arrived O
at O
Blechhammer B-LOC
at O
11PM O
. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
Jewish O
Capos B-TER
and O
block B-TER
seniors I-TER
.They O
were O
very O
friendly O
to O
us O
and O
said O
that O
we O
would O
continue O
tomorrow O
. O

We O
slept O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
four O
days O
in O
beds B-TER
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
drummed O
out O
of O
bed O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
and O
departure B-TER
. O

We O
however O
– O
a O
few O
hundred O
who O
were O
in O
one O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
at O
the O
back O
– O
had O
decided O
, O
that O
we O
would O
n’t O
go O
until O
the O
SS B-TER
came O
and O
collected O
us O
themselves O
. O

And O
we O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

700 O
men B-TER
had O
followed O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
were O
now O
leaving O
with O
them O
. O

Because O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
in O
a O
rush O
and O
you O
could O
already O
here O
the O
drone O
of O
the O
front O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
satisfied O
with O
the O
700 O
volunteers O
and O
left O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
to O
our O
punishment O
from O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

It O
was O
n’t O
a O
long O
period O
of O
peace O
. O

The O
next O
night O
, O
an O
SS B-TER
detachment I-TER
came O
and O
took O
a O
further O
400 O
men B-TER
who O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
gate O
out O
of O
curiosity O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
starving B-TER
which O
led O
to O
the O
savage O
killings B-TER
amongst O
themselves O
. O

The O
bread B-TER
and O
provision O
stores O
were O
attacked O
and O
anybody O
who O
left O
carrying O
bread O
was O
beaten O
and O
bludgeoned O
until O
unconscious O
or O
half O
dead O
by O
those O
standing O
outside O
. O

Death O
came O
when O
those O
who O
emerged O
afterwards O
stood O
on O
the O
those O
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
and O
defended O
what O
they O
had O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
an O
SS B-TER
annihilation I-TER
troop I-TER
had O
shown O
up O
and O
divided O
themselves O
amongst O
the O
watchtowers O
, O
using O
the O
people B-TER
running O
around O
blow O
as O
target O
practice O
. O

When O
they O
were O
finished O
and O
they O
were O
afraid O
as O
the O
front O
got O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
, O
they O
attempted O
to O
set O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
fire O
, O
which O
for O
all O
but O
two O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
they O
failed O
to O
do O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
made O
themselves O
scarce O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
a O
terrible O
sight O
. O

Every O
couple O
of O
meters O
there O
was O
a O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
, O
half O
burnt O
or O
bled O
- O
out O
and O
congealed O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

The O
bodies B-TER
caused O
a O
terrible O
smell O
of O
plague O
. O

We O
lived B-TER
like O
that O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
in O
the O
most O
awful O
fear O
that O
we O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
last O
minute O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Even O
when O
there O
was O
no O
more O
SS B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
we O
were O
still O
in O
the O
German B-TER
area O
of O
the O
front O
, O
and O
Russians B-ORG
were O
n’t O
coming O
as O
quickly O
as O
we O
hoped O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
, O
a O
brave O
man O
who O
had O
ventured O
outside O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
met O
a O
Russian B-ORG
tank O
. O

The O
rejoicing O
was O
immense O
, O
because O
none O
of O
us O
had O
thought O
that O
we O
would O
ever O
get O
out O
of O
the O
clutches O
of O
the O
German B-TER
beasts O
. O

the O

Berner B-PER
Isaak I-PER
, O
born O
: O
18.6.1909 O
in O
Riga B-LOC
On O
July O
1st O
, O
1941 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

On O
July O
2nd O
, O
an O
auxiliary O
Latvian B-LOC
SS B-TER
troop O
was O
formed O
. O

They O
wore O
green O
armbands O
on O
their O
sleeves O
with O
a O
skull O
on O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
this O
auxiliary O
troop O
did O
was O
to O
stop O
Jews O
in O
the O
street O
, O
to O
humiliate O
them O
, O
to O
throw O
Jewish O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
out O
of O
their O
apartments B-TER
and O
to O
force O
them O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Work B-TER
was O
done O
clearing O
up O
, O
where O
the O
aim O
was O
not O
so O
much O
that O
work B-TER
was O
done O
, O
but O
much O
more O
to O
tyrannise O
the O
Jews O
. O

Beards B-TER
were I-TER
pulled I-TER
out I-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
had O
their O
hair O
cut O
off O
, O
beaten B-TER
and O
kicked O
, O
the O
people O
stayed O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

On O
July O
3rd O
, O
the O
apartments B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
began O
to O
be O
ransacked B-TER
. O

On O
July O
6th O
, O
all O
the O
synagogues B-TER
in O
Riga B-LOC
were B-TER
set I-TER
on I-TER
fire I-TER
. O

I O
can O
testify O
under O
oath O
that O
many O
rabbis B-TER
, O
cantors O
, O
temple O
assistants O
and O
families O
that O
lived O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
the O
synagogues B-TER
were O
forced O
into O
the O
burning B-TER
synagogues I-TER
and O
suffocated O
and O
burnt B-TER
alive O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
the O
mass O
arrests O
began O
amongst O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

Over O
a O
short O
period O
, O
3000 O
- O
4000 O
Jews O
disappeared O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
these O
people O
. O

All O
of O
the O
Jews O
that O
were O
still O
free O
had O
to O
register O
daily O
at O
the O
prefecture O
and O
were O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
– O
of O
course O
– O
tormented O
in O
the O
worst O
ways O
possible O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
, O
Prefect O
Stieglitz B-PER
– O
a O
repatriated O
German B-TER
who O
had O
come O
back O
to O
Latvia B-LOC
– O
gathered O
all O
the O
leading O
Jewish O
men B-TER
and O
told O
them O
to O
form O
a O
Jewish O
committee O
. O

The O
members O
were O
the O
lawyer O
Dr. O
Eljachow B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Minz B-PER
Uncertain O
, O
whether O
he O
means O
Vladimir O
Mincs O
. O

, O
Kaugert B-PER
, O
Winzker B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Blumfeld B-PER
. O

Their O
task O
was O
: O
arranging O
for O
the O
relocation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Riga B-LOC
to O
the O
working O
- O
class O
suburb O
of O
Letgaler B-LOC
, O
an O
area O
where O
originally O
3000 O
- O
4000 O
had O
lived O
. O

In O
this O
cramped O
area O
, O
in O
the O
small O
, O
low O
rooms B-TER
, O
30 O
- O
40,000 O
people O
had O
to O
find O
accommodation B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
give O
our O
apartments B-TER
to O
the O
people O
moving O
out O
of O
the O
working O
- O
class O
area O
without O
any O
compensation O
, O
and O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
take O
essentials O
with O
us O
that O
we O
could O
carry O
; O
special O
permission O
was O
needed O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
take O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
cupboard O
with O
you O
. O

If O
it O
was O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
furniture O
, O
then O
the O
permission O
was O
n’t O
granted O
. O

The O
relocation B-TER
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
October O
15th O
, O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
then O
fenced O
in O
, O
surrounded O
by O
Latvian B-TER
SS B-TER
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
segregated O
and O
the O
tragedy O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
began O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
first O
days O
, O
many O
Jews O
who O
only O
got O
too O
close O
to O
the O
fence O
were O
shot O
attempting O
to O
escape O
. O

Shots O
were O
fired O
into O
windows O
that O
were O
supposedly O
the O
black O
- O
out O
was O
not O
good O
enough O
, O
many O
people O
died B-TER
as O
a O
result O
. O

Work B-TER
commandos I-TER
left O
daily O
. O

Anyone O
who O
was O
halfway O
able O
to O
tried O
to O
avoid O
it O
, O
as O
returning O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
could O
be O
deadly O
. O

You O
were O
checked O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
searches O
were O
undertaken O
and O
most O
were O
beaten O
; O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
not O
spared O
. O

Groceries B-TER
and O
essentials O
were O
supplied O
by O
14 O
shops O
, O
but O
the O
allocation O
got O
less O
and O
less O
every O
week O
. O

Security O
was O
provided O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Police I-TER
. O

On O
November O
18th O
, O
it O
was O
arranged O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
would O
be O
evacuated B-TER
and O
everyone O
would O
be O
transferred B-TER
to O
a O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

When O
Dr O
Eljachow B-PER
asked O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
old O
and O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
an O
SA O
man O
named O
Schulze B-PER
answered O
bluntly O
that O
anyone O
who O
was O
unable O
to O
march O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
20 O
kg O
of O
luggage O
with O
us O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
were O
really O
going O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

On O
November O
20th O
, O
Latvian B-LOC
workers O
came O
and O
isolated O
a O
small O
section O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
know O
why O
they O
had O
done O
it O
, O
but O
on O
November O
23rd O
, O
all O
of O
the O
strong O
men B-TER
were O
forced O
into O
this O
isolated O
section O
. O

On O
November O
30th O
, O
the O
grosse O
Aktion O
( O
big O
action O
) O
began O
. O

At O
6 O
pm O
, O
children B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
old O
people O
– O
with O
or O
without O
luggage O
– O
were O
driven B-TER
out I-TER
of O
their O
apartments B-TER
. O

Blows B-TER
, O
kicks B-TER
, O
shooting B-TER
, O
murder B-TER
were O
the O
tactics O
used O
to O
prompt O
the O
terrified O
people O
. O

People O
stayed O
on O
the O
streets O
for O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
until O
6 O
am O
, O
in O
the O
frost O
, O
hungry B-TER
and O
many O
poorly O
dressed O
. O

A O
group O
of O
1000 O
people O
were O
marched O
on O
foot O
along O
the O
Moskauer B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
( O
Moscow B-LOC
Street I-LOC
) O
under O
the O
strict O
supervision O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Nobody O
was O
allowed O
to O
watch O
, O
even O
Aryans B-TER
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
look O
out O
of O
the O
window O
as O
shots O
were O
immediately O
fired O
. O

This O
evacuation B-TER
lasted O
until O
December O
9th O
, O
1941 O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
those O
of O
us O
in O
the O
isolated O
part O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
heard O
that O
Russian O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
were O
digging O
pits B-TER
outside O
of O
town O
by O
Quadrat O
in O
Salasplis B-LOC
and O
in O
the O
Bickernjaken O
woods O
. O

We O
could O
n’t O
find O
out O
initially O
what O
they O
were O
for O
. O

We O
found O
out O
from O
farmers O
that O
lived O
nearby O
and O
from O
the O
statements O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
able O
to O
escape B-TER
: O
The O
transports B-TER
with O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
( O
and O
also O
several O
men B-TER
too O
) O
were O
forced O
to O
the O
pits B-TER
and O
mown B-TER
down I-TER
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

The O
screaming O
and O
wailing O
of O
the O
poor O
victims O
was O
so O
harrowing O
, O
that O
many O
farmers O
on O
the O
immediate O
area O
could O
n’t O
sleep O
for O
days O
. O

In O
this O
action O
, O
around O
27,000 O
women B-TER
, O
around O
3000 O
children B-TER
between O
1 O
and O
13 O
years O
as O
well O
as O
4000 O
- O
5000 O
men B-TER
who O
were O
less O
able O
to O
work O
were O
murdered B-TER
. O

The O
whole O
Aktion O
was O
led O
by O
General O
Jeckeln B-PER
, O
who O
was O
based O
in O
the O
Knight O
’s O
Hall O
in O
Riga B-LOC
with O
his O
accomplices O
, O
Dr O
Lange B-PER
and O
the O
SA O
man O
Schulze B-PER
. O

To O
the O
character O
of O
General O
Jeckeln B-PER
I O
want O
to O
add O
: O
when O
several O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
his O
house O
to O
work B-TER
for O
him O
, O
he O
did O
n’t O
like O
two O
of O
them O
. O

Out O
of O
nowhere O
he O
shot B-TER
them O
. O

After O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Aktion O
, O
nearly O
5000 O
men B-TER
and O
around O
270 O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
who O
had O
been O
able O
to O
hide B-TER
during O
the O
evacuation B-TER
remained O
in O
the O
small O
isolated O
section O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
camp O
elder O
at O
the O
time O
and O
got O
permission O
from O
the O
commandants B-TER
to O
bring O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
into O
a O
special O
block O
, O
and O
later O
other O
women B-TER
from O
Latvia B-LOC
came O
as O

. O

There O
was O
a O
total O
of O
500 O

600 O
women B-TER

Krauss B-PER
, O
his O

was O
SS B-TER
Scharführer B-TER
Roschmann B-PER
. O

The O

was O
designated O
a O
barrack/ O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
all O
the O
inmates B-TER
had O
to O
work B-TER
without O

. O

Three O

were O
set O
up O
and O
we O
received O

there O
was O
only O

in O
the O
large O

. O

Almost O
everyone O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
day O
. O

The O
large O
ghetto B-TER
was O
taken O
over O
by O
a O
trust O
, O
and O
the O

found O
there O
was O
sold O
in O
packages O
for O
15 O

to O
the O
local O
population O
, O
whole O
wagons O
full O
of O

were O
sent O
to O
Germany B-TER
as O

assistance O
from O
the O
Latvian B-LOC
people O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
kept O
the O
best O

for O
themselves O
. O

Three O
days O
after O
the O
annihilation O

, O
13 O
- O
14,000 O
Jews O
from O
Germany B-TER
( O

In O
Szirotowa O
they O

the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
deliver O
money O
, O
valuables O
, O
stocks O
and O
gold O
. O

We O
surrendered O
115,000 O
marks O
and O
a O
fortune O
in O
gold O
, O
jewellery O
and O
diamonds O
. O

The O
worth O
is O
difficult O
to O
estimate O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fortune O
. O

Eight O
days O
later O
, O
the O
first O
two O
Jews O
were O
publically O
hanged B-TER
in O
the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
. O

One O
was O
found O
to O
have O
60 O
pfennigs O
and O
the O
other O
1 O
mark O
. O

After O
the O
execution B-TER
was O
carried O
out O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
ordered O
to O
carry O
out O
another O
collection O
of O
money O
, O
golds O
and O
valuables O
, O
as O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
not O
everything O
had O
been O
handed O
over O
. O

We O
immediately O
carried O
out O
another O
collection O
and O
raised O
80,000 O
marks O
. O

As O
a O
personal O
gift O
for O
the O
Commandant B-TER
Krause B-PER
, O
we O
kept O
some O
diamonds O
, O
a O
gold O
clock O
and O
cigarette O
case O
to O
one O
side O
for O
him O
. O

It O
was O
said O
, O
that O
he O
refused O
the O
gift O
and O
threw O
it O
into O
the O
basket O
with O
all O
the O
other O
things O
. O

A O
constable O
said O
later O
, O
that O
Krause B-PER
took O
enough O
things O
that O
he O
could O
live O
from O
them O
for O
100 O
years O
. O

The O
hangings B-TER
and O
shootings B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
n’t O
stopped O
; O
for O
every O
small O
infraction O
, O
someone O
had O
to O
pay O
with O
their O
life B-TER
. O

The O
executions B-TER
by O
hanging O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Police I-TER
who O
were O
left O
in O
the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Riga B-LOC
carried O
out O
many O
arrests O
amongst O
us O
, O
especially O
from O
important O
businessmen O
or O
industrial O
people O
. O

These O
people O
disappeared O
and O
never O
came O
back O
. O

Within O
a O
year O
, O
1000 O
Jews O
had O
been O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
existed O
until O
1943 O
- O
06 O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
it O
was O
disbanded O
and O
we O
were O
housed B-TER
in O
groups O
at O
the O
companies O
that O
we O
were O
working B-TER
for O
, O
in O
barracks B-TER
and O
under O
stricter O
guard O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
the O
newly O
founded O
Kaiserwalde O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
near O
Riga B-LOC
. O

Food B-TER
was O
quite O
scarce O
in O
the O
factory O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
to O
keep O
you O
alive O
and O
not O
have O
to O
starve B-TER
. O

As O
the O
Russians B-ORG
approached O
, O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Germany B-LOC
and O
housed B-TER
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

July O
night O
. O

Already O

they O
’re O
had O
been O
a O
certain O
degree O
of O

in O
the O

The O
rumour O
was O
another O

We O
were O
collected O
from O
my O
house B-TER
and O
on O
the O
next O
day O
were O
put O
into O
train B-TER
carriages I-TER

In O
one O

, O
there O
are O
60 O

, O

whether O

everybody O
was O
put O

the O

1000 O
people O
were O
next O
to O
each O
other O
and O
the O
train B-TER
began O
to O
move O
. O

Heat O
and O
a O
bad O
, O
pestilent O
air O
made O
breathing O
difficult O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
know O
where O
our O
journey O
was O
taking O
us O
. O

The O
carriages B-TER
were O
completely O
closed O
, O
no O
light O
came O
on O
, O
no O
air O
or O
water O
was O
available O
to O
us O
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
a O
two O
- O
day O
journey O
, O
tired O
and O
exhausted O
, O
we O
arrived O
on O
the O
25.7.1942 O
in O
an O
awful O
, O
empty O
field O
. O

The O
carriages B-TER
were O
opened O
by O
high O
- O
ranking O
members B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
SS I-TER
. O

We O
were O
told O
to O
get O
out O
. O

First O
, O
us O
women B-TER
had O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
carriages B-TER
, O
then O
the O
men B-TER
. O

We O
could O
hear O
the O
loud O
shouting O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
hordes I-TER
. O

Come O
on O
, O
come O
on O
, O
this O
is O
your O
final O
destination O
. O

And O
so O
, O
it O
was O
either O
obey O
or O
die O
; O
that O
was O
our O
welcome O
. O

Us O
women B-TER
were O
put O
to O
one O
side O
, O
of O
course O
only O
the O
young O
ones O
, O
maximum O
35 O
years O
old O
. O

The O
rest O
were O
thrown O
into O
vans O
like O
bags O
of O
flour O
, O
60 O
to O
80 O
per O
van O
. O

Before O
we O
were O
taken O
somewhere O
else O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
other O
vans O
leave O
. O

New O
vans O
were O
filled O
and O
driven O
away O
. O

Then O
was O
our O
turn O
: O
we O
were O
put O
in O
a O
line O
, O
counted O
, O
and O
made O
to O
march O
. O

A O
member B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
SS I-TER
, O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Schütze I-TER
was O
our O
supervisor O
. O

With O
rifles O
and O
pistols O
, O
he O
showed O
us O
the O
way O
to O
our O
new O
site O
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
the O
camp O
the O
supervisor O
shouted O
and O
so O
this O
is O
how O
you O
left O
Egypt O
, O
and O
here O
you O
will O
die O
anyway O
, O
those O
of O
us O
who O
heard O
this O
, O
broke O
out O
into O
a O
cold O
sweat O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
we O
met O
men B-TER
in O
striped O
uniforms O
, O
accompanied O
by O
SS B-TER
with O
carabiners O
in O
the O
hands O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
might O
have O
shouted O
to O
us O
whether O
we O
had O
any O
food B-TER
, O
but O
their O
fear O
of O
death B-TER
was O
too O
great O
. O

As O
we O
approached O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
we O
saw O
the O
large O
inscription O
Arbeit O
macht O
frei O
( O
Work B-TER
makes O
you O
free O
) O
, O
but O
still O
we O
did O
n’t O
know O
where O
we O
were O
being O
brought O
to O
. O

Columns O
of O
men B-TER
walking O
along O
the O
long O
, O
terrible O
streets O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
tired O
and O
drawn O
faces O
of O
the O
men B-TER
solved O
for O
us O
that O
puzzle O
. O

In O
was O
a O
morning O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
in O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
as O
we O
arrived O
. O

Thousands O
of O
bald O
- O
headed O
people B-TER
with O
a O
Russian B-LOC
military O
uniforms O
turned O
to O
look O
at O
us O
as O
we O
entered O
. O

In O
that O
moment O
, O
we O
thought O
, O
that O
we O
were O
in O
a O
Russian B-LOC
prisoner B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
camp I-TER
. O

From O
the O
individual O
rows O
, O
I O
could O
hear O
muffled O
calls O
, O
I O
was O
recognised O
by O
several O
acquaintances O
from O
my O
own O
town O
. O

If O
you O
have O
anything O
with O
you O
, O
throw O
it O
away O
. O

A O
few O
people B-TER
from O
the O
rows O
of O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
even O
put O
their O
hands O
out O
, O
in O
order O
to O
take O
some O
bread B-TER
or O
whatever O
from O
us O
, O
for O
the O
hunger B-TER
was O
eating O
away O
at O
them O
. O

It O
was O
a O
terrible O
sight O
. O

Immediately O
afterwards O
, O
all O
of O
the O
columns O
left O
the O
camp B-TER
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
a O
bathroom O
, O
undressed B-TER
, O
shaved O
. O

They O
called O
it O
delousing O
. O

We O
were O
given O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

A O
linen B-TER
dress I-TER
and O
wooden O
shoes O
, O
that O
was O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
I O
had O
, O
everything O
that O
I O
had O
on O
. O

We O
received O
a O
small O
flannel O
, O
that O
they O
called O
a O
hand O
towel O
, O
to O
share O
between O
three O
people B-TER
. O

93 O
freshly O
shaved O
, O
bathed O
, O
and O
newly O
dressed B-TER
, O
we O
were O
led O

SS B-TER

Schwartz O
, O
the O
camp B-TER
leader I-TER
and O
commander B-TER
, O
reprimanded O
the O
newly O
arrived O
cohort O
. O

After O
registration B-TER
was O
carried O
out O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
we O
were O
allowed O
into O
the O
block B-TER
, O
which O
would O
now O
be O
our O
new O
home O
. O

The O
head O
female B-TER
supervisor I-TER
, O
Marie B-PER
Mandel I-PER
, O
also O
did O
n’t O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
, O
for O
us O
to O
be O
lined O
up O
again O
. O

It O
offered O
her O
amusing O
moments O
to O
insult O
us O
. O

Mistbiene O
( O
garbage O
bees O
) O
was O
her O
special O
term O
. O

That O
’s O
how O
we O
spent O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
we O
went O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Five O
hours O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
in O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
until O
the O
supervisors B-TER
Gertrude B-PER
Weniger I-PER
, O
Brandl B-PER
, O
Erika B-PER
Clauss I-PER
, O
Marie B-PER
Hasse I-PER
, O
Berta B-PER
Franz I-PER
and O
others O
, O
agreed O
to O
pronounce O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
over O
and O
let O
us O
leave O
the O
rows O
. O

And O
so O
, O
every O
day O
was O
the O
same O
for O
us O
. O

On O
9.8.1942 O
, O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
was O
moved O
to O
Birkenau B-LOC

Here O
the O
plague O
have O
reached O
full O
bloom O
; O
illnesses B-TER
, O
hunger B-TER
, O
and O
abuse B-TER
were O
all O
part O
of O
the O
daily O
regime O
. O

In O
the O
blocks B-TER
there O
was O
no O
light O
, O
water O
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
the O
people B-TER
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
in O
the O
streets O
between O
the O
barracks O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
corpses B-TER
lay O
on O
the O
streets O
, O
without O
being O
cleared O
away O
. O

Transports B-TER
arrived O
hourly O
. O

Because O
there O
was O
no O
space O
, O
the O
old O
prisoners B-TER
were O
sent O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

There O
was O

the O

with O
the O

Dr. O

and O
ended O
with O
a O
balance O
of O

400 O
to O
600 O
human O

On O

Me O

made O
themselves O

We O

in O
the O
German O
language O
and O
sent O
over O
to O
the O
political B-TER
department I-TER
of O
the O

. O

Here O
in O
the O
office O
, O
the O
motto O
was O
silence O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
work O
there O
we O
were O
made O
aware O
, O
that O
if O
we O
said O
a O
word O
about O
the O
work O
done O
in O
the O
office O
of O
the O

, O
then O
we O
would O
have O
to O
pay B-TER
for I-TER
this I-TER
with I-TER
our I-TER
lives I-TER
. O

This O
department B-TER
was O
actually O
nothing O
different O
than O

For O

the O
prisoner B-TER
in O
question O
had O
died B-TER
from O
some O
disease B-TER
or O
another O
. O

Usually O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
was O
given O
as O
a O
lung O
infection O
or O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

We O
were O
well O
aware O
of O
what O
this O
meant O
, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
keep O
our O
countenance O
. O

We O
heard O
it O
from O
him O
often O
, O
that O
he O
would O
make O
us O
ready O
for O
a O
happy O
ascension B-TER
to I-TER
heaven I-TER
, O
if O
we O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
. O

It O
was O
peculiarity O
of O
his O
, O
that O
Boger B-PER
made O
sure O
that O
his O
staff B-TER
received O
better O
food B-TER
and O
clothing B-TER
than O
others O
. O

He O
did O
n’t O
ask O
his O
typists B-TER
to O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
secret O
service O
, O
because O
he O
did O
n’t O
trust O
them O
. O

There O
were O
60 O
women B-TER
prisoners I-TER
in O
our O
commando O
. O

One O
day O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
several O
of O
us O
have O
not O
been O
adhering O
to O
the O
regulations O
laid O
out O
for O
the O
camp B-TER
at O
the O
office O
. O

Namely O
, O
documents O
about O
certifications O
had O
been O
found O
in O
the O
corridor O
. O

Because O
none O
of O
us O
would O
say O
from O
whom O
they O
came O
, O
eight O
of O
the O
staff B-TER
in O
the O
office O
were O
fired O
and O
sent O
immediately O
back O
to O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

This O
happened O
by O
order O
of O
the O
head O
of O
personnel O
, O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Oberscharführer I-TER
Robert B-PER
Kirschner I-PER
Hermann O
Kirschner O
. O

In O
the O
first O
week O
of O
this O
hard O
labour B-TER
outside I-TER
, O
the O
eight O
female B-TER
prisoners I-TER
were O
ill B-TER
and O
brought O
to O
the O
Revier B-TER
. O

After O
they O
had O
recovered O
, O
one O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
managed O
to O
be O
assigned O
to O
an O
agricultural B-TER
commando O
. O

There O
she O
met O
a O
male B-TER
prisoner I-TER
, O
with O
whom O
she O
exchanged O
letters B-TER
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Personal O
discussions O
were O
completely O
forbidden O
at O
this O
time O
, O
and O
came O
with O
great O
personal O
danger O
. O

One O
day O
, O
one O
of O
the O
women B-TER
’s O
commandos O
was O
returning O
from O
work B-TER
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
they O
met O
a O
men B-TER
’s O
commando O
. O

One O
of O
the O
female B-TER
prisoners I-TER
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
give O
a O
passing O
male B-TER
prisoner I-TER
a O
letter B-TER
. O

This O
was O
noticed O
by O
a O
member B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
SS I-TER
and O
immediately O
reported O
to O
the O
political B-TER
department I-TER
. O

After O
a O
long O
interrogation B-TER
of O
the O
female O
prisoner O
, O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
find O
out O
, O
for O
which O
man B-TER
the O
letter B-TER
was O
intended O
. O

She O
was O
abused O
and O
locked O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
. O

And O
then O
suddenly O
, O
we O
received O
a O
notice O
of O
her O
death B-TER
, O
that O
the O
prisoner B-TER
had O
died B-TER
from O
lung O
infection O
whilst O
under O
camp O
arrest O
. O

The O
letter B-TER
was O
even O
by O
the O
camp B-TER
standards O
completely O
trivial O
, O
she O
wrote O
when O
will O
there O
be O
a O
time O
when O
we O
can O
say O
anything O
we O
want O
and O
nobody O
will O
stand O
in O
our O
way O
? O
. O

Such O
cases O
happened O
almost O
daily O
, O
first O
the O
prisoner B-TER
would O
be O
abused O
and O
then O
shot B-TER
, O
or O
even O
sent O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
alive O
. O

It O
sounds O
perhaps O
unbelievable O
, O
when O
I O
write O
down O
the O
individual O
things O
that O
happened O
during O
the O
months O
that O
I O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
office O
. O

We O
experienced O
some O
incredible O
things O
, O
for O
example O
: O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
month O
, O
always O
on O
a O
Thursday O
, O
purges O
were O
done O
in O
the O
camp O
prison B-TER
. O

With O
a O
degree O
of O
delight O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
members I-TER
of O
the O
individual O
departments O
from O
our O
political B-TER
department I-TER
went O
to O
the O
camp O
prison B-TER
and O
shot B-TER
the O
individual O
prisoner B-TER
s O
that O
they O
did O
not O
like O
. O

Naturally O
, O
they O
would O
drink O
afterwards O
and O
end O
the O
day O
with O
celebrations O
. O

six O

on O
the O
30th O
August O
1943 O
, O
had O
them O
publicly O
hanged B-TER
in O
the O

Such O
cases O
were O
repeated O
often O
. O

And O
so O
, O
you O
were O
never O
sure O
whether O
you O
might O
be O
taken O
for O
reprisal O
, O
if O
you O

particularly O
in O

, O
smuggled B-TER
letters B-TER
and O
other O
things O
out O
of O

with O
the O
help O
of O

. O

Lachmann B-PER
was O
a O
small O
, O
thin O
man O
and O
looked O
very O
pale O
, O
he O
would O
often O
put O
on O
the O
prisoner B-TER
clothing O
, O
go O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
spend O
the O
night O
there O
, O
in O
order O
to O
hear O
from O
prisoners B-TER
who O
did O
n’t O
recognise O
him O
what O
was O
going O
on O
in O
the O
camp B-TER

After O
such O
undercover O
work O
, O
there O
are O
always O
many O
prisoners B-TER
who O
would O
be O
doomed O
to O
death B-TER
. O

As O
the O
second O
and O
neighbouring O
camp B-TER
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
Birkenau B-LOC
was O
known O
as O
Camp B-LOC
II I-LOC
. O

SS B-TER
- I-TER
Obersturmführer I-TER
Kramer B-PER
was O
the O
commandant B-TER
of O
this O

. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
SS B-TER

. O

They O
lead O
the O

, O
along O
with O
the O

doctor I-TER
and O
together O
with O
the O

In O
the O
years O
1942 O
to O
1945 O
, O
the O
camp B-TER
doctors I-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
were O
: O
Dr. O

, O
Dr. O
Rohde B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Wirths B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Thilo B-PER
, O
amongst O
others O
. O

These O
led O
in O
the O
most O
terrible O
and O
infamous O
way O
the O
selections B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
from O
several O
sources O
, O
that O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
there O
was O
a O
special O
experimentation B-TER
block I-TER
. O

This O
block O
was O
solely O
occupied O
by O
Greek B-LOC
, O
Polish B-LOC
, O
and O
Belgian B-LOC
female B-TER
Jews O
. O

The O
head B-TER
doctor I-TER
was O
Dr O
Wirths B-PER
. O

Based O
on O
different O
pieces O
of O
correspondence B-TER
in O
our O
office O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
the O
block O
was O
supervised O
Prof O
Clauberg B-PER
in O
Königshütte B-LOC
near O
Kattowitz B-LOC
, O
who O
ran O
a O
sanatorium O
there O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
develop O
a O
serum O
for O
fertilisation O
and O
sterilisation B-TER
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
do O
so O
, O
experiments B-TER
were O
carried O
out O
on O
individual O
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
accommodated O
in O
this O
block O
. O

In O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
was O
solely O
carried O
out O
by O
Jews O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
SS B-TER
members I-TER
, O
such O
as O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Uscha I-TER
Seitz B-PER
, O
Georgen B-PER
, O
Erber B-PER
, O
Mokrus B-PER
, O
Schillinger B-PER
and O
others O
. O

Schillinger B-PER
was O
shot B-TER
by O
a O
female B-TER
prisoner I-TER
, O
who O
had O
only O
just O
arrived O
at O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
with O
his O
own O
pistol O
. O

The O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
was O
under O
the O
command B-TER
of O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Obersturmführer I-TER
Max B-PER
Sell I-PER
, O
a O
master O
tailor O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
a O
monster O
in O
human O
form O
. O

He O
could O
n’t O
stand O
either O
the O
smiling O
or O
the O
crying O
of O
a O
prisoner B-TER
. O

The O
abuse O
of O
prisoners B-TER
was O
a O
delight O
to O
him O
. O

Sell B-PER
found O
his O
equal O
in O
the O
form O
of O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Obersturmführer I-TER
Rössler B-PER
. O

He O
was O
the O
head B-TER
of O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
. O

His O
subordinate O
, O
the O
female B-TER
guard I-TER
Drechsler B-PER
, O
carried O
out O
all O
of O
his O
commands O
and O
wishes O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
, O
searches O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
to O
find O
out O
whether O
a O
prisoner B-TER
has O
a O
piece B-TER
of I-TER
clothing I-TER
that O
the O
camp B-TER
leadership I-TER
considered O
excessive O
. O

Cooking O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
one O
of O
the O
major O
crimes O
. O

This O
was O
punished O
with O
your O
hair O
being O
cut O
off O
, O
being O
put O
in O
the O
bunker B-TER
, O
denied B-TER
food I-TER
and O
even O
24 O
hours O
of O
standing O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
there O
was O
also O
a O
stake O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
30 O
to O
60 O
minutes O
at O
this O
stake O
were O
given O
as O
a O
punishment O
. O

In O
1943 O
, O
in O
July O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
this O
was O
abolished O
. O

A O
memo O
in O
the O
file O
about O
punishment O
at O
the O
stake O
was O
destroyed O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
we O
had O
to O
go O
and O
re O
- O
write O
thousands O
of O
files O
which O
contained O
such O
memos O
. O

Another O
toy O
that O
was O
used O
as O
a O
deterrent O
and O
to O
which O
prisoners B-TER
and O
civil O
workers O
both O
fell O
victim O
, O
was O
something O
that O
was O
known O
as O
the O
swing O
. O

It O
was O
a O
wooden O
contraption O
, O
to O
which O
iron O
bars O
were O
attached O
. O

The O
prisoner B-TER
that O
was O
to O
be O
the O
victim O
, O
was O
bound O
to O
the O
swing O
by O
their O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
spun O
around O
. O

On O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
swing O
, O
SS B-TER
members I-TER
stood O
and O
would O
hit O
and O
kick O
and O
abuse O
the O
prisoner B-TER
as O
they O
were O
twisted O
. O

It O
often O
happened O
, O
that O
the O
victim O
remained O
unconscious O
. O

Blood O
stains O
and O
any O
other O
traces O
were O
often O
immediately O
cleaned O
away O
so O
that O
they O
would O
n’t O
be O
noticed O
by O
other O
prisoner B-TER
s O
when O
they O
entered O
the O
room O
for O
their O
interrogation B-TER
. O

One O
such O
swing O
was O
installed O
in O
the O
office O
– O
in O
the O
interrogation B-TER
room I-TER
– O
where O
I O
worked B-TER
. O

At O
such O
performances O
, O
I O
was O
observed O
to O
see O
what O
faces O
I O
made O
. O

Such O
things O
occurred O
almost O
daily O
. O

My O
nerves O
had O
reached O
the O
point O
that O
I O
’ve O
become O
quite O
mechanical O
, O
like O
a O
machine O
. O

Sleepless O
nights O
, O
illness B-TER
and O
tiredness O
were O
written O
large O
across O
my O
face O
. O

After O
several O
months O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
clerk O
Rottenführer B-TER
Perry B-PER
Broad I-PER
was O
transferred O
to O
another O
department O
and O
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
him O
again O
. O

Now O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
easier O
. O

The O
abuses O
no O
longer O
took O
place O
right O
in O
front O
of O
my O
eyes O
. O

January O
1944 O
, O
I O
was O
once O
again O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
gypsy B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Here O
they O
were O
only O
German B-LOC
, O
Czech B-LOC
, O
and O
Polish B-LOC
gypsies B-TER
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
there O
was O
roughly O
20,000 O
. O

Illness B-TER
and O
disease B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
meant O
that O
after O
barely O
six O
months O
, O
the O
reduction O
by O
more O
than O
10,000 O
was O
noticeable O
. O

In O
spring O
1944 O
, O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Between O
15 O
and O
20,000 O
arrived O
daily O
. O

The O
crematorium B-TER
– O
there O
was O
four O
of O
them O
– O
could O
n’t O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
rapid O
burning O
of O
these O
victims O
and O
so O
between O
the O
third O
and O
fourth O
crematorium B-TER
, O
ditches O
were O
dug O
, O
and O
fires O
were O
set O
in O
them O
. O

The O
crematoria B-TER
were O
located O
in O
a O
wasteland O
, O
that O
was O
called O
the O
woods O
. O

Giant O
flames O
could O
be O
seen O
from O
far O
away O
. O

The O
smoke O
was O
such O
that O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
summer O
it O
was O
enough O
to O
almost O
suffocate O
. O

One O
morning O
, O
as O
I O
was O
on O
the O
way O
to O
work B-TER
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
mass O
of O
people B-TER
gathered O
by O
our O
office O
block O
, O
which O
was O
located O
outside O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
that O
moment O
, O
I O
did O
n’t O
know O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

It O
was O
old O
people B-TER
, O
mothers B-TER
with O
children B-TER
in O
their O
arms O
. O

They O
were O
praying O
, O
because O
they O
had O
understood O
everything O
that O
stood O
before O
then O
. O

The O
crematorium B-TER
was O
only O
another O
hundred O
steps O
away O
. O

And O
soon O
it O
meant O
for O
the O
people B-TER
who O
are O
waiting O
, O
that O
it O
was O
their O
turn O
. O

After O
several O
minutes O
, O
from O
this O
mass O
of O
around O
300 O
people B-TER
, O
there O
was O
only O
clouds O
of O
smoke O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

This O
went O
on O
for O
the O
whole O
summer O
, O
even O
into O
late O
1944 O
of O
1944 O
, O
when O
in O
crematorium B-TER
three O
there O
was O
an O
uprising B-TER
and O
mass B-TER
escape I-TER
planned O
. O

It O
was O
a O
sunny O
evening O
in O
September O
, O
and O
we O
heard O
break O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
coming O
from O
the O
camp B-TER
around O
midday O
. O

Crematorium B-TER
three O
have O
been O
set O
on O
fire O
. O

People B-TER
were O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
blocks O
ordered O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
. O

After O
roughly O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
fire O
was O
brought O
under O
control O
. O

A O
report O
was O
written O
immediately O
by O
us O
in O
the O
office O
. O

I O
learnt O
that O
a O
mass B-TER
escape I-TER
had O
occurred O
. O

Namely O
, O
that O
all O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
crematoria B-TER
2 O
and O
3 O
that O
escaped B-TER
. O

Before O
they O
blew O
up O
the O
crematorium B-TER
and O
escaped B-TER
, O
they O
had O
done O
a O
purge O
of O
the O
commando O
. O

As O
their O
leader O
– O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Capo B-TER
– O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
had O
had O
an O
ethnic O
German O
prisoner B-TER
. O

He O
had O
spied O
on O
them O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

In O
order O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
they O
were O
able O
to O
escape B-TER
and O
to O
blow O
up O
the O
crematoria B-TER
, O
they O
pushed O
him O
into O
the O
fire O
. O

Roughly O
two O
hours O
after O
the O
successful O
escape B-TER
, O
all O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
have O
been O
recaptured O
. O

, O
who O
had O
the O
Czech B-LOC
background O
, O
carried O
out O
a O
heroic O
act O
, O
in O
that O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Unterscharführer I-TER

– O
both O
of O
whom O
came O
from O

shot B-TER
and O
killed B-TER
279 O

in O
front O
of O
crematorium B-TER
2 O
and O
450 O
prisoners B-TER
from O

3 O
. O

We O
had O
a O
death B-TER
notice O
for O
over O
729 O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
trying O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

After O
about O
four O
weeks O
, O
by O
way O
of O
deterrence O
, O
a O
further O
100 O
prisoners B-TER
from O
the O
commando O
in O
crematorium B-TER
1 O
and O
4 O
were O
punished O
with O
death B-TER
. O

In O
connection O
with O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
four O
female B-TER
prisoners I-TER
, O
Polish B-LOC
Jews B-TER
, O
were O
hanged B-TER
on O
30.12.1944 O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
all O
camp B-TER
inhabitants I-TER
had O
to O
be O
present O
for O
the O
carrying O
out O
of O
the O
death B-TER
sentence I-TER
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
had O
been O
working B-TER
in O
the O
ammunition O
factory B-TER
UNION O
. O

From O
there O
, O
they O
brought O
explosives O
and O
had O
smuggled B-TER
them O
into O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
as O
well O
as O
the O
crematoria B-TER
. O

During O
summer O
1944 O
, O
prisoners B-TER
also O
escaped B-TER
from O
camp B-LOC
2 I-LOC
. O

There O
was O
a O
Belgian B-LOC
female B-TER
Jew O
and O
a O
Pole B-LOC
. O

After O
roughly O
14 O
days O
, O
they O
were O
found O
near O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
as O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
travel O
away O
, O
caught O
and O
locked O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
jail I-TER
. O

After O
a O
long O
interrogation B-TER
and O
harassment O
, O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
supposed O
to O
be O
hanged B-TER
. O

The O
female B-TER
prisoner I-TER
was O
brought O
to O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
because O
she O
knew O
that O
this O
was O
the O
day O
that O
the O
death B-TER
sentence I-TER
would O
be O
carried O
out O
, O
she O
slit O
her O
wrists O
by O
the O
gate O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
was O
noticed O
by O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Unterscharführer I-TER
Ritters B-PER
. O

He O
jumped O
at O
her O
, O
and O
took O
the O
razor O
that O
she O
had O
in O
her O
hand O
away O
from O
her O
. O

As O
the O
razorblade O
was O
taken O
away O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
, O
the O
prisoner B-TER
was O
able O
to O
deal O
him O
several O
blows O
to O
the O
face O
. O

And O
so O
, O
the O
abuse O
of O
the O
prisoner B-TER
began O
again O
anew O
. O

She O
was O
forced O
along O
the O
camp B-TER
streets O
and O
beaten O
. O

Every O
prisoner B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish O
nation O
had O
to O
be O
present O
. O

After O
an O
hour O
of O
this O
wrestling O
with O
death B-TER
, O
the O
prisoner B-TER
was O
half O
- O
conscious O
and O
thrown O
into O
a O
box O
with O
wheels O
attached O
and O
transferred O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

The O
male B-TER
prisoner I-TER
was O
hanged B-TER
at O
the O
same O
time O
in O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
. O

The O
reason O
behind O
his O
sentence O
was O
because O
together O
with O
a O
Jewish O
femaleprisoner O
he O
attempted O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
camp O
. O

Such O
cases O
repeated O
themselves O
during O
my O
time O
at O
the O
camp B-TER
quite O
often O
. O

Prisoners B-TER
were O
escaping B-TER
almost O
daily O
from O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
, O
particularly O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Russian B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
. O

When O
they O
were O
recaptured O
, O
they O
were O
hanged B-TER
or O
shot B-TER
in O
front O
of O
all O
the O
camp B-TER
inmates B-TER
. O

If O
a O
prisoner B-TER
was O
shot B-TER
during O
their O
escape B-TER
, O
the O
corpse B-TER
would O
be O
tied O
in O
a O
sitting O
position O
to O
a O
chair O
and O
all O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
had O
to O
march O
past O
. O

This O
was O
used O
as O
a O
deterrent O
. O

After O
all O
of O
these O
experiences O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
we O
all O
became O
more O
and O
more O
numb O
. O

Here O
it O
was O
either O
bend O
or O
break O
. O

Our O
facial O
expressions O
were O
n’t O
like O
those O
of O
people O
living O
in O
freedom O
. O

Hunger B-TER
, O
fear O
for O
your O
own O
life O
, O
this O
made O
us O
animals O
without O
feeling O
. O

Our O
many O
experiences O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
such O
as O
the O
selections B-TER
and O
other O
things O
during O
my O
almost O
3 O
years O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
made O
us O
hard O
. O

Often O
, O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
I O
would O
never O
experience O
the O
free O
world O
again O
. O

Particularly O
those O
of O
us O
in O
my O
commando O
did O
n’t O
think O
about O
ever O
being O
free O
again O
. O

Our O
supervisors B-TER
comforted O
us O
by O
saying O
that O
if O
Germany B-TER
was O
victorious O
, O
that O
we O
would O
still O
have O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
Reich B-TER
, O
but O
that O
will O
be O
no O
longer O
concentrated O
, O
but O
rather O
obliged O
to O
work B-TER
. O

If O
Germany B-TER
were O
to O
lose O
the O
war B-TER
, O
that O
will O
be O
the O
end B-TER
of O
us O
. O

We O
were O
no O
longer O
informed O
about O
the O
political O
events O
in O
the O
world O
, O
because O
we O
only O
had O
very O
few O
chances O
to O
listen O
to O
illegal O
radio O
stations O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
was O
also O
punishable O
by O
death B-TER
. O

And O
there O
were O
many O
such O
victims O
. O

Particularly O
Czechs B-LOC
and O
the O
Polish B-LOC
fell O
victim O
to O
this O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
illegal O
activity O
developed O
amongst O
the O
prisoners B-TER
in O
the O
neighbouring O
camp B-TER
Jaworzno B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
coal O
mine O
a O
tunnel O
was O
being O
built O
. O

Over O
1500 O
Czech B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
were O
involved O
in O
this O
work B-TER
. O

As O
there O
were O
also O
experts O
amongst O
them O
, O
they O
built O
themselves O
a O
smaller O
tunnel O
alongside O
the O
main O
one O
, O
which O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
used O
by O
the O
prisoners B-TER
to O
escape B-TER
. O

When O
the O
work B-TER
was O
finished O
, O
the O
prisoners B-TER
– O
this O
was O
roughly O
in O
September O
1943 O
- O
were O
going O
to O
all O
leave O
the O
camp B-TER
one O
night O
. O

The O
escape B-TER
was O
well O
- O
planned O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

However O
, O
amongst O
these O
prisoners B-TER
there O
was O
a O
Pole B-LOC
who O
knew O
what O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
had O
planned O
. O

He O
pretended O
that O
he O
planned O
to O
escape B-TER
with O
them O
and O
was O
able O
to O
find O
out O
when O
they O
planned O
their O
escape B-TER
. O

He O
reported O
this O
to O
the O
political B-TER
department I-TER
, O
who O
were O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
escape B-TER
with O
guard O
posts O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
October O
1943 O
, O
32 O
Czech B-LOC
people B-TER
were O
shot B-TER
after O
a O
long O
period O
of O
torment O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
Polish B-LOC
man O
had O
, O
through O
this O
betrayal O
, O
gathered O
some O
attention O
in O
our O
department O
, O
especially O
with O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Unterscharführer I-TER
Schürz O
and O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Uscha I-TER
Lachmann O
. O

He O
carried O
out O
his O
work O
as O
an O
informant O
quite O
openly O
, O
and O
was O
a O
very O
feared O
man O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

None O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
dared O
to O
remove O
him O
from O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

It O
was O
shortly O
before O
Christmas O
, O
that O
the O
Polish B-LOC
prisoner B-TER
came O
to O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Uscha I-TER
Lachmann O
, O
who O
at O
this O
time O
I O
was O
working B-TER
at O
the O
typist O
for O
, O
and O
demanded O
$ O
100 O
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
catch O
prisoners B-TER
and O
civilians O
smuggling B-TER
. O

He O
gave O
the O
prisoner B-TER
the O
hundred O
dollars O
that O
he O
demanded O
. O

The O
prisoner B-TER
also O
asked O
that O
he O
be O
accompanied O
by O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Rottenführer I-TER
Jarosewitsch O
, O
as O
the O
place O
of O
exchange O
was O
outside O
of O
the O
cordon O
. O

The O
prisoner B-TER
left O
our O
office O
and O
said O
that O
he O
would O
report O
back O
that O
afternoon O
before O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
with O
the O
results O
. O

The O
whole O
commando O
returned O
from O
work B-TER
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
wait O
in O
the O
office O
as O
the O
prisoner B-TER
and O
the O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
Jarosewitz B-PER
had O
not O
reported O
back O
. O

I O
was O
frightened O
. O

The O
message O
came O
, O
that O
the O
Polish B-LOC
prisoner B-TER
, O
together O
with O
the O
Jewish O
prisoner B-TER
, O
accompanied O
by O
Jarosewitz B-PER
had O
escaped B-TER
. O

Jarosewitz B-PER
had O
been O
murdered B-TER
by O
them O
behind O
the O
large O
fence O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Telegrams O
and O
wanted O
posters O
followed O
, O
regarding O
the O
two O
escaped B-TER
prisoners B-TER
. O

Nothing O
was O
said O
in O
front O
of O
me O
in O
the O
office O
, O
but O
I O
used O
to O
get O
the O
post O
, O
from O
which O
I O
was O
able O
to O
glean O
the O
important O
facts O
. O

From O
that O
day O
on O
, O
prisoners B-TER
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
camp B-TER
with O
two O
SS B-TER
members I-TER
present O
. O

There O
are O
many O
other O
things O
that O
happened O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
in O
the O
office O
that O
I O
do O
n’t O
feel O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
write O
down O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

On O
the O
13.1.1945 O
, O
the O
evacuation B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
began O
. O

After O
eight O
days O
of O
wandering O
around O
without O
aim O
, O
we O
arrived O
half O
- O
frozen O
, O
hungry B-TER
and O
tired O
at O
Ravensbrück B-LOC
. O

Here O
we O
spent O
our O
time O
without O
food B-TER
, O
in O
a O
tent B-TER
– O
1500 O
prisoners B-TER
– O
for O
over O
three O
weeks O
. O

After O
that O
we O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
neighbouring O
camp B-TER
in O
Malchow B-LOC
in O
Mecklenburg B-LOC
. O

The O
Auschwitz B-LOC

now O
for O

Memorandum O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
jurisdiction B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

The O
jurisdiction B-TER
of O
the O
court B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Self I-ORG
- I-ORG
administration I-ORG
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
derived O
from O
the O
authorisation O
of O
the O
command O
of O
the O
security O
forces O
[ O
SS B-TER
] O
there O
. O

It O
had O
jurisdiction B-TER
over O
custody O
, O
probate O
and O
criminal B-ORG
matters I-ORG
. O

In O
matters O
of O
probate O
, O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
court B-TER
were O
limited O
to O
the O
confiscation O
of O
clothing O
and O
pieces O
of O
laundry O
, O
as O
the O
Jewish O
settlement O
could O
n’t O
acquire O
the O
items O
required O
by O
the O
destitute O
inhabitants B-TER
in O
any O
other O
way O
; O
any O
real O
administration O
of O
estates O
was O
completely O
absent O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
assets O
. O

The O
responsibility O
of O
the O
court B-ORG
in I-ORG
criminal I-ORG
matters I-ORG
was O
usually O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
a O
district O
court B-TER
. O

In O
special O
cases O
and O
through O
a O
special O
authorisation O
from O
the O
[ O
SS B-TER
] O
command O
, O
the O
jurisdiction B-TER
could O
be O
extended O
and O
eventually O
included O
full O
sentencing O
competency O
in O
matters O
of O
crimes O
and O
offences O
, O
whose O
sentencing O
– O
as O
with O
any O
transgression O
– O
was O
trusted O
to O
a O
single O
judge O
. O

As O
the O
legal O
basis O
for O
the O
jurisdiction B-TER
of O
the O
court B-TER
ended O
with O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
[ O
SS B-ORG
] O
command O
, O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
court B-TER
were O
largely O
discontinued O
and O
only O
continued O
when O
it O
involved O
the O
determination O
of O
criminal O
offences O
in O
preliminary O
proceedings O
. O

A O
special O
custodial O
jurisdiction B-TER
for O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
is O
, O
in O
consideration O
of O
the O
likely O
short O
- O
lived O
existence O
of O
the O
settlement O
, O
completely O
superfluous O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
a O
probate O
court B-TER
, O
as O
the O
only O
decision O
that O
could O
be O
made O
by O
the O
court B-TER
was O
that O
, O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
assets O
, O
no O
probate O
proceedings O
will O
take O
place O
. O

However O
, O
what O
is O
essential O
is O
the O
maintenance O
a O
criminal O
justice O
system O
. O

Criminality O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
had O
its O
own O
characteristics O
; O
aside O
from O
a O
small O
number O
of O
cases O
such O
as O
insulting O
a O
public O
servant O
or O
minor O
assault O
( O
§ O
411 O
) O
, O
nearly O
all O
of O
the O
property O
- O
related O
offences O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
scarcity O
of O
food B-TER
, O
were O
either O
theft O
from O
the O
communal O
storehouses O
, O
or O
fraud O
at O
the O
food B-TER
distribution O
points O
. O

These O
offences O
were O
alarming O
due O
to O
their O
frequency O
and O
the O
punishment O
was O
disproportionately O
higher O
than O
the O
sentence O
would O
have O
been O
outside O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
similar O
offences O
. O

These O
offences O
continue O
and O
seem O
unlikely O
to O
stop O
. O

The O
district O
court B-TER
responsible O
will O
hardly O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
deal O
with O
sentencing O
these O
cases O
that O
deal O
with O
what O
are O
– O
in O
normal O
circumstances O
– O
small O
things O
. O

They O
can O
however O
not O
go O
unpunished O
. O

The O
makeup O
of O
the O
population B-TER
shifted O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
last O
transports B-TER
carried O
out O
by O
the O
German O
authorities O
, O
which O
also O
led O
a O
to O
significant O
worsening O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
terms O
of O
criminality O
. O

Transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
bringing O
political O
rather O
career O
criminals O
with O
them O
. O

Is O
has O
also O
been O
difficult O
to O
make O
other O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
prisoners B-TER
become O
accustomed O
to O
conforming O
to O
the O
calm O
and O
regulations O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
crimes O
that O
have O
gone O
unpunished O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
a O
law O
enforcement O
system O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
such O
cases O
will O
have O
to O
dealt O
with O
by O
the O
ordinary O
courts B-TER
. O

These O
courts B-TER
will O
, O
however O
, O
hardly O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
make O
the O
required O
institutions O
available O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
preliminary O
proceedings O
. O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
the O
continued O
activity O
of O
the O
Jewish O
court B-TER
would O
be O
expedient O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
exercising O
of O
police O
penal O
power O
is O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
now O
it O
has O
been O
exercised O
by O
a O
judge O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
a O
special O
jurisdiction B-TER
for O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
violations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
matter O
of O
police O
powers O
is O
essential O
. O

The O
possibility O
must O
also O
be O
available O
, O
that O
crimes O
and O
offences O
can O
be O
determined O
. O

As O
long O
as O
these O
activities O
can O
not O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
usual O
bodies O
and O
institutions O
, O
the O
continued O
existence O
of O
the O
Theresienstadt B-TER

This O
happened O
on O
one O
of O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
murderous O
attack O
from O
the O
German B-TER
planes O
on O
the O
almost O
unprotected O
city O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
– O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
month O
of O
September O
1939 O
. O

By O
chance O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
Żoliborz B-LOC
around O
the O
school B-TER
of O
the O
streetcar O
workers O
’ O
union O
. O

The O
air O
was O
pierced O
by O
the O
heart O
- O
rending O
shouting O
of O
sirenes O
. O

The O
approaching O
of O
German B-TER
planes O
were O
announced O
. O

This O
time O
, O
they O
targeted O
the O
beautifully O
built O
neighborhood O
of O
Żoliborz B-LOC
. O

Seven O
bombers O
with O
yellow B-TER
swastika I-TER
on O
their O
snooty O
tails O
dropped O
frank O
and O
free O
incendiary O
and O
fougasse O
bombs O
on O
top O
of O
the O
residences O
of O
peaceful O
and O
unprotected O
workers O
, O
employees O
, O
and O
clerks O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
gateway O
and O
suddenly O
heard O
a O
deafening O
bursting O
detonation O
. O

Pieces O
of O
violet O
fire O
sparkled O
in O
front O
of O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
soon O
an O
enormous O
cloud O
of O
smoke O
arose O
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
on O
the O
school B-TER
of O
the O
streetcar O
workers O
’ O
union O
, O
a O
fougasse O
bomb O
was O
thrown O
. O

Children B-TER
ran O
out O
of O
the O
collapsing O
building O
– O
disconcerted O
, O
tearful O
, O
bloody O
. O

The O
children B-TER
ran O
together O
in O
one O
direction O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
several O
planes O
descended O
. O

And O
there O
, O
they O
are O
already O
flying O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
children B-TER
. O

And O
something O
happened O
that O
freezes O
the O
blood O
in O
one O
’s O
veins O
. O

The O
German B-TER
murderers B-TER
, O
who O
saw O
the O
escaping B-TER
children B-TER
very O
well O
from O
the O
short O
distance O
that O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
earth O
, O
looked O
out O
from O
their O
seats O
in O
the O
planes O
, O
aimed O
their O
machine O
guns O
at O
the O
compressed O
group O
of O
children B-TER
, O
flew O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
hailed O
the O
children B-TER
with O
hundreds O
of O
murderous O
blows O
. O

The O
flight O
of O
the O
air O
- O
murderers O
hovering O
back O
and O
forth O
over O
the O
group O
of O
the O
dozens O
of O
children B-TER
lasted O
for O
ten O
minutes O
– O
this O
was O
sufficient O
to O
have O
each O
and O
every O
child B-TER
lying O
in O
puddles O
of O
blood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
. O

On O
the O
street O
, O
some O
grown O
- O
ups O
were O
running O
as O
well O
while O
the O
German B-TER
planes O
were O
descending O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
bandits O
avoided O
the O
grown O
- O
ups O
, O
however O
, O
and O
deliberately O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
children B-TER
. O

* O
* O
* O
My O
wife B-TER
went O
to O
bring O
water O
from O
the O
well O
: O
the O
pipes O
were O
destroyed O
by O
the O
bombs O
of O
the O
enemies O
. O

The O
well O
was O
located O
on O
the O
Catholic B-TER
cemetery I-TER
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
Powązki B-LOC
on O
Yablonska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

At O
the O
well O
, O
an O
enormous O
queue O
of O
women B-TER
was O
standing O
, O
each O
one O
with O
a O
bucket O
, O
with O
a O
cups O
, O
with O
teapots O
. O

An O
air O
raid O
occurred O
. O

The O
women B-TER
hugged O
one O
another O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
sky O
with O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
a O
heart O
- O
rending O
wailing O
broke O
out O
. O

Five O
German B-TER
planes O
descended O
very O
low O
over O
the O
cemetery B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
started O
to O
frantically O
run O
to O
all O
sides O
, O
looking O
for O
protection O
in O
the O
bushes O
, O
between O
the O
graves O
. O

But O
planes O
were O
flying O
close O
over O
their O
heads O
and O
shot B-TER
directly O
at O
the O
women B-TER
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
at O
the O
right O
side O
from O
the O
place O
where O
my O
wife B-TER
was O
standing O
, O
a O
woman B-TER
fell O
from O
a O
bullet O
. O

From O
the O
left O
side O
, O
a O
plane O
descended O
so O
low O
so O
that O
the O
murderous O
pilot O
hit O
the O
head O
of O
an O
elderly O
woman B-TER
with O
a O
wing O
and O
killed B-TER
her O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

After O
the O
Fascist B-ORG
army I-ORG
invaded O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
some O
of O
their O
pilots O
bragged O
: O
We O
did O
n’t O
even O
let O
them O
scoop O
water O
on O
the O
cemetery O
in O
Powązki O
! O
At O
that O
time O
at O
the O
well O
, O
several O
dozen O
women B-TER
died B-TER
. O

* O
* O
* O
All O
of O
these O
troubles O
was O
nothing O
against O
what O
the O
National O
Socialist O
pimps O
and O
murderers B-TER
did O
later O
on O
. O

Whoever O
got O
away O
with O
a O
one O
- O
day O
work B-TER
- I-TER
assignment I-TER
of O
tearing B-TER
out I-TER
stones I-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
cobblestone I-TER
pavement I-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
street I-TER
, O
or O
of O
carrying B-TER
water I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
horses I-TER
, O
or O
of O
cleaning B-TER
toilets I-TER
with I-TER
the I-TER
hands I-TER
and O
thereby O
catching O
some O
dry O
blows O
was O
a O
lucky O
one O
. O

Whoever O
got O
out O
alive O
from O
under O
the O
predatory O
claws O
, O
which O
took O
off O
the O
shoes B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
coat B-TER
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
, O
may O
recite O
goyml O
blessing O
recited O
in O
the O
synagogue O
after O
escaping O
a O
great O
danger O
. O

. O

Whoever O
was O
dragged O
out O
off O
his O
home O
to O
go O
to O
work O
to O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
Polish O
Parliament O
. O

, O
would O
say O
goodbye O
to O
their O
wife B-TER
and O
children B-TER
anticipating O
that O
he O
wo O
n’t O
be O
coming O
back O
home O
again O
. O

The O
large O
building O
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
on O
Wiejska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
was O
partly O
destroyed O
from O
the O
bombs O
of O
the O
enemy O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
dragged O
there O
whole O
groups O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
residents O
for O
them O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
building I-TER
. O

Through O
small O
streets O
off O
the O
beaten O
paths O
, O
I O
went O
to O
my O
acquaintance O
L.Sh O
. O

, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
publishing O
house O
Tomor O
. O

He O
lived O
on O
Leszno B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
time O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
avoid O
bumping O
into O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
two O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
armed O
with O
rifles O
were O
standing O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
the O
yard O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
as O
if O
they O
had O
suddenly O
grown O
out O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

They O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
to O
me O
, O
only O
one O
of O
them O
called O
me O
over O
with O
his O
finger O
. O

I O
walked O
over O
. O

Your O
profession O
? O
– O
he O
asked O
me O
. O

I O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
I O
am O
a O
writer B-TER
. O

A O
teacher O
, O
I O
said O
. O

If O
so O
, O
you O
will O
be O
going O
with O
the O
group O
designated O
to O
work O
in O
the O
Sejm O
, O
– O
the O
German B-TER
said O
. O

There O
you O
will O
elevate O
your O
pedagogical O
qualifications O
, O
he O
added O
with O
a O
poisonous O
smile O
. O

For O
a O
moment O
, O
I O
stood O
there O
confused O
. O

The O
German B-TER
gave O
the O
order O
not O
clear O
. O

Forward O
March O
! O
and O
gave O
my O
behind O
the O
tip O
of O
his O
boot O
. O

I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
neighboring O
Smotshe B-LOC
Street I-LOC
where O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
was O
already O
standing O
– O
in O
rows O
of O
two O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
I O
also O
saw O
my O
acquaintance O
– O
the O
journalist B-TER
Sh O
. O

G. O
A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
we O
were O
escorted O
to O
Wiejska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
inside O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
large O
corridor O
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
lobby O
of O
a O
legislative O
building O
. O

, O
we O
were O
assembled O
and O
an O
officer B-TER
, O
a O
young O
one O
, O
approximately O
twenty O
three O
or O
twenty O
four O
years O
old O
, O
held O
a O
speech O
in O
front O
of O
us O
about O
the O
work B-TER
regulations O
. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
speech O
was O
roughly O
as O
follows O
: O
– O
We O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
will O
teach O
you O
how O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Throughout O
the O
working B-TER
time O
you O
will O
have O
to O
be O
standing O
bend O
over O
. O

If O
you O
straighten O
your O
back O
, O
if O
you O
look O
around O
, O
if O
you O
interrupt O
your O
work B-TER
, O
you O
will O
receive O
the O
hardest O
punishment O
– O
from O
punches O
to O
execution B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

You O
will O
be O
working B-TER
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Food B-TER
will O
not O
be O
provided O
. O

Before O
you O
go O
home O
, O
everyone O
will O
get O
a O
sip O
of O
water O
so O
you O
wo O
n’t O
be O
thirsty O
. O

During O
the O
working O
hours O
, O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
might O
come O
in O
and O
shout O
: O
Heil O
Hitler O
! O
– O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
hear O
this O
, O
you O
have O
to O
drop O
, O
fall O
with O
your O
face O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
immediately O
move O
again O
, O
get O
up O
and O
cry O
out O
: O
Heil O
Hitler O
! O
, O
and O
then O
fall O
to O
the O
floor O
again O
; O
after O
that O
, O
you O
have O
to O
get O
up O
and O
get O
back O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
lobby I-TER
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
– O
taking O
out O
pieces O
of O
chalk O
, O
broken O
glass O
, O
dirt O
. O

We O
were O
afraid O
to O
straighten O
our O
backs O
and O
look O
around O
. O

Our O
backs O
hurt O
really O
bad O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
we O
heard O
a O
shot B-TER
right O
beside O
us O
. O

Several O
straightened O
their O
backs O
out O
of O
fear O
and O
looked O
around O
. O

Soon O
enough O
, O
a O
second O
and O
third O
shot O
was O
heard O
. O

Two O
men O
were O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
because O
they O
straightened O
their O
backs O
and O
looked O
around O
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
no O
one O
of O
us O
could O
really O
know O
, O
what O
was O
going O
on O
around O
us O
. O

Only O
the O
next O
day O
I O
learned O
that O
my O
acquaintance O
, O
the O
journalist B-TER
Sh O
. O

G. O
, O
got O
out O
as O
a O
cripple O
. O

For O
one O
second O
, O
he O
rested O
and O
wiped O
away O
the O
sweat O
with O
his O
sleeve O
and O
immediately O
a O
bandit O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
up O
to O
him O
and O
hit O
him O
with O
a O
whip O
directly O
at O
his O
eyes O
. O

Sh O
. O

G. O
wears O
glasses O
– O
the O
spectacles O
glasses O
burst O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
glass O
went O
into O
his O
eye O
. O

And O
in O
this O
way O
, O
bloody O
and O
weakened O
, O
he O
had O
to O
carry O
bricks O
and O
dirt O
. O

There O
was O
no O
end O
to O
the O
Heil O
Hitler O
. O

Every O
few O
minutes O
, O
another O
soldier B-TER
came O
in O
and O
yelled O
the O
verse O
. O

We O
had O
to O
immediately O
throw O
ourselves O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
on O
the O
pointed O
pieces O
of O
brick O
and O
pointed O
bundles O
of O
wires O
. O

My O
face O
turned O
red O
, O
smeared O
with O
blood O
and O
dirt O
, O
my O
hands O
– O
black O
pieces O
of O
congealed O
blood O
. O

Since O
not O
everyone O
replied O
Heil O
Hitler O
as O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
up O
with O
a O
special O
punishment O
for O
us O
. O

While O
we O
were O
standing O
like O
that O
bent O
over O
and O
worked O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
they O
pierced O
us O
from O
behind O
with O
spears O
and O
bayonets O
– O
to O
turn O
around O
, O
as O
mentioned O
, O
meant O
to O
catch O
a O
bullet O
in O
your O
head O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

Many O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
fell O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
them O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

Night O
fell O
. O

The O
young O
officer B-TER
came O
in O
again O
. O

He O
commanded O
us O
to O
stop O
working B-TER
and O
to O
get O
into O
several O
rows O
. O

– O
Now O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
drink O
of O
water O
. O

You O
should O
freshen O
up O
after O
work B-TER
– O
he O
said O
. O

Our O
palates O
were O
dry O
and O
really O
dried O
up O
like O
pieces O
of O
hard O
leather O
. O

Close O
to O
fainting O
and O
bloody O
, O
we O
were O
standing O
there O
in O
our O
ripped O
clothes B-TER
and O
waited O
for O
the O
little O
bit O
of O
water O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
stood O
there O
with O
a O
sincere O
and O
solemn O
look O
on O
his O
face O
. O

Several O
dozen O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
in O
. O

No O
water O
was O
brought O
to O
us O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
sit O
down O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
hardly O
standing O
up O
anyways O
on O
our O
bended O
knees O
. O

He O
ordered O
that O
we O
lift O
our O
heads O
up O
and O
open O
our O
mouths O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
a O
sign O
to O
the O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
. O

SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
up O
to O
groups O
of O
three O
, O
unbuttoned O
their O
trousers O
, O
and O
pissed O
directly O
into O
our O
mouths O
. O

We O
started O
to O
choke O
, O
throw O
up O
, O
spit O
. O

Then O
the O
German B-TER
took O
out O
revolvers O
and O
threatened O
to O
shoot B-TER
anyone O
who O
would O
not O
swallow O
the O
pure O
Aryan B-TER
urine O
. O

After O
that O
we O
were O
ordered O
to O
say O
: O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
far O
the O
fresh O
drink O
! O
At O
the O
end O
, O
the O
officer B-TER
gave O
another O
speech O
that O
in O
this O
way O
we O
will O
learn O
how O
to O
work B-TER
, O
that O
every O
one O
of O
us O
has O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
announced O
that O
we O
are O
released O
and O
can O
run O
home O
– O
yes O
, O
run O
! O
He O
prohibited O
us O
to O
walk O
, O
– O
only O
to O
run O
. O

Since O
it O
was O
already O
late O
at O
night O
, O
after O
7 O
pm O
– O
i.e. O
already O
after B-TER
the I-TER
point I-TER
, I-TER
when I-TER
we I-TER
were I-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
be I-TER
outside I-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
street I-TER
, O
one O
of O
us O
turned O
to O
the O
officer B-TER
asking O
for O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
, O
some O
form O
of O
permit O
, O
so O
we O
would O
n’t O
run O
into O
trouble O
on O
our O
way O
home O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
got O
really O
angry O
, O
took O
out O
his O
revolver O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
immediately O
run O
home O
– O
if O
not O
, O
he O
will O
shoot B-TER
everyone O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

The O
distance O
from O
Wiejska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
to O
our O
neighborhood B-LOC
is O
several O
kilometers O
. O

So O
we O
ran O
. O

Patrols O
shot B-TER
after O
us O
. O

Who O
got O
killed B-TER
amidst O
this O
nighttime O
shooting B-TER
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

* O
* O
* O
In O
the O
first O
nights O
of O
their O
rule O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
the O
wild O
, O
drunk O
Fascist B-TER
started O
to O
rape B-TER
young O
girls B-TER
. O

To O
the O
bookkeeper O
Popover B-PER
, O
where O
I O
lived O
as O
a O
subletter O
, O
an O
elderly O
Polish B-TER
woman B-TER
came O
, O
an O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
lived O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
Marshalkovska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
under O
bitter O
tears O
how O
drunken O
Germans B-TER
raped B-TER
her O
two O
daughters B-TER
and O
several O
other O
daughters B-TER
of O
her O
neighbors O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Hitlerites B-TER
entered O
the O
apartment O
and O
ordered O
all O
elderly O
residents O
to O
leave O
the O
apartment O
immediately O
. O

The O
two O
young O
girls B-TER
, O
one O
20 O
years O
old O
and O
the O
other O
17 O
years O
old O
, O
were O
ordered O
to O
stay O
. O

They O
tore O
off O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
from O
the O
girls B-TER
and O
one O
after O
the O
other O
committed B-TER
acts I-TER
of I-TER
violence I-TER
against I-TER
them I-TER
. O

The O
desperate O
cries O
from O
the O
unfortunate O
girls B-TER
mixed O
with O
loud O
laughter O
of O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
. O

In O
order O
to O
scare O
off O
the O
neighbors O
so O
that O
they O
wo O
n’t O
run O
out O
of O
their O
apartments O
and O
make O
a O
scene O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
shot O
into O
the O
air O
several O
times O
. O

After O
they O
had O
raped B-TER
the O
girls B-TER
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
animals O
took O
away O
all O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
clothes B-TER
, O
from O
the O
blouses B-TER
to O
the O
coats B-TER
, O
so O
that O
the O
girls B-TER
had O
to O
remain O
laying O
naked O
. O

Before O
they O
left O
, O
they O
announced O
that O
they O
will O
come O
again O
tomorrow O
evening O
and O
that O
the O
house O
should O
supply O
several O
fresh O
girls B-TER
for O
them O
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
all O
girls B-TER
and O
young O
women B-TER
of O
the O
house O
hid B-TER
somewhere O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
rapists B-TER
came O
. O

They O
got O
really O
angry O
when O
they O
did O
not O
meet O
any O
young O
women B-TER
. O

They O
took O
out O
the O
two O
eldest O
residents O
of O
the O
building O
and O
they O
dragged O
them O
away O
to O
the O
SS B-ORG
drumhead O
court O
- O
martial O
which O
usually O
tries O
cases O
every O
other O
day O
. O

The O
two O
elderly O
women B-TER
were O
charged O
with O
resisting O
the O
decrees B-TER
of O
the O
German B-TER
power O
. O

Both O
of O
them O
were O
sent O
away O
deep O
into O
Germany B-TER
somewhere O
. O

* O
* O
* O
At O
first O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
only O
men B-TER
. O

Soon O
enough O
, O
they O
started O
to O
catch O
women B-TER
as O
well O
. O

Once O
– O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
October O
– O
my O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
Perl O
L. O
( O
she O
lived O
on O
Nizko B-LOC
Street I-LOC
) O
, O
a O
young O
thirty O
three O
year O
old O
woman B-TER
, O
was O
among O
those O
who O
got O
caught O
. O

A O
group O
of O
caught O
women B-TER
– O
for O
most O
part O
young O
women B-TER
– O
were O
led O
into O
a O
large O
shared O
apartment O
of O
Hitlerites B-TER
. O

They O
were O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
apartment I-TER
, O
to O
do B-TER
the I-TER
laundry I-TER
and O
to O
darn B-TER
the I-TER
socks I-TER
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
youth O
started O
to O
insult O
the O
women B-TER
in O
a O
mean O
refined O
way O
. O

My O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
together O
with O
several O
others O
was O
led O
into O
a O
large O
room O
and O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
. O

They O
were O
not O
given O
any O
rags O
to O
clean O
with O
, O
instead O
they O
were O
ordered O
to O
take O
off O
their O
underwear B-TER
and O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
with I-TER
it I-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
had O
to O
undress O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
. O

The O
young O
Hitlerites B-TER
stood O
there O
and O
made O
professional O
, O
cynical O
remarks O
about O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
uncovered O
limbs O
just O
like O
experienced O
pimps O
. O

The O
women B-TER
put O
on O
the O
dresses B-TER
on O
their O
naked O
bodies O
and O
started O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
with O
their O
underwear B-TER
. O

After O
several O
minutes O
, O
they O
received O
the O
order O
to O
lift O
up O
the O
dresses B-TER
over O
their O
bellies O
during O
the O
work B-TER
. O

The O
degenerate O
person O
in O
charge O
provided O
a O
explanation O
for O
his O
command O
: O
We O
will O
teach O
you O
how O
to O
work O
in O
a O
cultured O
manner O
. O

When O
you O
rub O
a O
floor O
, O
you O
have O
to O
take O
good O
care O
of O
your O
dress O
. O

The O
horrific O
torture B-TER
commenced O
only O
now O
. O

Every O
few O
minutes O
, O
new O
scoundrels O
came O
in O
in O
a O
soldier B-TER
’s I-TER
uniform O
and O
threw O
a O
woman B-TER
to O
the O
floor O
, O
into O
the O
dirty O
water O
. O

Pointing O
the O
revolver O
at O
her O
, O
they O
ordered O
them O
to O
lift O
their O
legs O
, O
shone O
into O
their O
vaginas O
with O
little O
electric O
lamps O
and O
threatened O
that O
, O
if O
the O
women B-TER
would O
not O
let O
themselves O
be O
examined O
, O
they O
will O
be O
raped B-TER
. O

After O
the O
cleaning B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
was O
done O
, O
the O
women B-TER
were O
forced O
to O
put O
on O
their O
bodies O
the O
sopping O
wet O
, O
dirty O
and O
muddy O
rags O
of O
underwear B-TER
. O

With O
even O
more O
impudence O
and O
brutality O
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
carried O
out O
inspections O
of O
women B-TER
at O
the O
German B-TER
- O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

Hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
war B-TER
refugees B-TER
from O
the O
German B-TER
- O
Polish B-TER
war B-TER
ran O
away O
from O
Hitler B-PER
to O
the O
new O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

My O
wife B-TER
was O
among O
the O
refugees B-TER
( O
at O
that O
time O
, O
I O
was O
already O
in O
Soviet B-TER
Białystok B-LOC
) O
. O

At O
the O
border B-TER
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
carried O
out O
an O
inspection O
– O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
separate O
from O
one O
another O
. O

The O
border B-TER
inspection O
of O
women B-TER
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
horrific O
inventions O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
rapists B-TER
. O

They O
ordered O
the O
women B-TER
to O
get O
naked O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
field O
in O
front O
of O
the O
eyes O
of O
thousands O
of O
passer O
- O
bys O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
border B-TER
guard O
, O
of O
course O
, O
saw O
that O
the O
women B-TER
did O
not O
have O
anything O
on O
them O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
he O
groped O
about O
the O
naked O
women B-TER
brutally O
and O
cynically O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
second O
soldier B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
the O
main O
procedure O
took O
place O
. O

Every O
naked O
woman B-TER
had O
to O
go O
to O
an O
officer B-TER
, O
open O
her O
legs O
and O
bend O
over O
. O

The O
officer O
shone O
into O
her O
vagina O
with O
a O
little O
electric O
lamp O
and O
turned O
a O
stick O
inside O
ostensibly O
looking O
for O
diamonds O
or O
forbidden O
documents O
. O

This O
happened O
on O
October O
20 O
, O
1939 O
, O
on O
an O
open O
field O
in O
front O
of O
the O
eyes O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
– O
at O
the O
German B-TER

The O
path O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
bandites O
over O
Polish B-TER
soil O
was O
drawn O
with O
streams O
of O
blood O
from O
the O
innocent O
civilian O
population O
. O

In O
the O
second O
week O
of O
their O
invasion O
into O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
gangs O
had O
already O
ejected O
onto O
the O
streets O
residents O
of O
whole O
neighborhoods O
and O
did O
not O
permit O
anyone O
to O
take O
anything O
with O
them O
from O
their O
own O
belongings O
. O

In O
this O
vein O
, O
they O
issued O
a O
decree B-TER
, O
for O
instance O
, O
that O
residents O
of O
the O
whole O
Novolipky B-LOC
Street I-LOC
to I-LOC
the I-LOC
corner I-LOC
of I-LOC
Karmelitska I-LOC
are O
to O
move O
out O
within O
fifteen O
minutes O
and O
every O
person O
who O
they O
will O
meet O
there O
after O
those O
fifteen O
minutes O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

During O
the O
nights O
, O
special O
gangs O
used O
to O
command O
residents O
of O
single O
buildings O
to O
move O
out O
, O
beat O
the O
residents O
up O
terribly O
and O
took B-TER
everything I-TER
that I-TER
could I-TER
be I-TER
taken I-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
they O
ridiculed O
the O
people O
in O
the O
most O
horrific O
and O
refined O
ways O
. O

– O
To O
whom O
do O
the O
things O
in O
the O
apartment O
belong O
? O
– O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
gang O
would O
usually O
ask O
, O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
attack O
. O

– O
Ours O
– O
the O
residents O
would O
reply O
innocently O
. O

The O
bandits O
usually O
attacked O
everyone O
without O
exceptions O
– O
men B-TER
, O
children B-TER
and O
women B-TER
– O
and O
beat O
them O
up O
cruelly O
until O
it O
occurred O
to O
one O
of O
the O
victims B-TER
to O
say O
: O
Apologies O
, O
the O
things O
are O
not O
ours O
, O
they O
are O
yours O
. O

Those O
nighttime O
attacks O
became O
the O
terror O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

Especially O
horrible O
in O
inhumanity O
and O
open O
sadism O
was O
the O
evening O
hunt O
. O

At O
8 O
pm O
in O
the O
summer O
, O
not O
one O
civilian O
dared O
to O
be O
on O
the O
street O
anymore O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
cannibals O
used O
this O
situation O
to O
entertain O
themselves O
. O

They O
were O
usually O
walking O
on O
the O
streets O
drunk O
, O
tipsy O
, O
with O
guns O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
if O
they O
noticed O
someone O
one O
minute O
after O
8 O
pm O
on O
the O
streets O
, O
possibly O
in O
front O
of O
the O
gate O
of O
his O
/ O
her O
home O
, O
they O
immediately O
aimed O
their O
guns O
at O
the O
person O
and O
shot B-TER
without O
any O
warning O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O
mother B-TER
of O
one O
of O
my O
acquaintances O
living O
in O
the O
first O
numbers O
of O
Muranov B-LOC
Street I-LOC
was O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
, O
a O
elderly O
weak O
lady B-TER
who O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
run O
through O
the O
gate O
fast O
enough O
. O

The O
life O
of O
those O
people O
who O
were O
dragged O
to O
work O
by O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
turned O
completely O
chaotic O
. O

I O
put O
work O
in O
quotation O
marks O
because O
most O
of O
the O
time O
people O
were O
simply O
taken O
to O
be O
tortured B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
I O
witnessed O
the O
following O
case O
in O
the O
shtetele O
Miechów B-LOC
near O
Lublin B-LOC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
where O
I O
was O
caught O
by O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
gangs O
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
my O
wanderings O
across O
Poland B-TER
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
invaded O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
, O
they O
first O
made O
a O
visit O
in O
the O
Jewish B-LOC
besmedresh B-LOC
Prayer O
and O
study O
house O
. O

and O
destroyed O
in O
a O
vandalic O
way O
everything O
that O
was O
there O
: O
they O
shattered O
the O
window O
panes O
, O
broke O
the O
walls O
into O
pieces O
, O
broke O
the O
clock O
, O
the O
mantle O
lamps O
, O
the O
cupboards O
and O
ripped O
all O
books O
and O
Torah O
scrolls O
apart O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
they O
rampaged O
through O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
beat O
up O
every O
young O
person O
they O
bumped O
into O
, O
and O
tore B-TER
off I-TER
the I-TER
beards I-TER
of O
the O
elder O
ones O
. O

Around O
three O
o’clock O
, O
they O
started O
going O
from O
house O
to O
house O
in O
order O
to O
summon O
people O
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
taking O
for O
work B-TER
turned O
into O
a O
hunt O
by O
wild O
animals O
for O
a O
handful O
of O
innocent O
people O
. O

From O
all O
sides O
of O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
, O
the O
wild O
bandites O
came O
running O
with O
savage O
, O
inhumane O
howling O
, O
waving O
with O
thick O
sticks O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
hunting O
people O
who O
in O
agony O
were O
running O
aimlessly O
back O
and O
forth O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
rounded O
up O
a O
few O
hundred O
men B-TER
, O
old O
and O
young O
, O
almost O
completely O
undressed O
them O
, O
took B-TER
everything I-TER
what I-TER
they I-TER
owned I-TER
away I-TER
from I-TER
them I-TER
, O
and O
loaded O
them O
on O
trucks O
. O

All O
of O
this O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
accompanied O
by O
blows O
and O
vile O
insults O
. O

The O
most O
horrific O
part O
, O
however O
, O
started O
only O
at O
the O
work O
itself O
which O
consisted O
of O
pulling B-TER
in I-TER
heavy I-TER
trucks I-TER
into I-TER
a I-TER
deep I-TER
, I-TER
muddy I-TER
puddle I-TER
and I-TER
then I-TER
to I-TER
drag I-TER
it I-TER
out I-TER
again I-TER
, O
or O
it O
consisted O
of O
running B-TER
after I-TER
a I-TER
bicycle I-TER
which I-TER
was I-TER
going I-TER
as I-TER
fast I-TER
as I-TER
it I-TER
could I-TER
. O

The O
latter O
was O
mostly O
carried O
out O
during O
the O
breaks O
from O
work O
or O
after O
the O
work O
like O
an O
additional O
reward O
. O

Taken O
together O
, O
this O
whole O
system O
of O
work O
was O
called O
the O
education O
into O
people O
fit O
for O
work O
. O

The O
method B-TER
of O
this O
very O
education O
was O
as O
follows O
. O

The O
group O
, O
which O
was O
not O
capable O
to O
drag B-TER
out I-TER
the I-TER
truck I-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
deep I-TER
puddle I-TER
very I-TER
fast I-TER
, O
had O
to O
immerse B-TER
itself I-TER
into I-TER
the I-TER
puddle I-TER
under I-TER
heavy I-TER
blows I-TER
and I-TER
to I-TER
drink I-TER
of I-TER
it I-TER
afterwards I-TER
. O

One O
thin O
, O
tortured B-TER
boy B-TER
from O
Puławy B-LOC
almost O
choked O
after O
such O
a O
puddle O
- O
bath O
and O
drink O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
to O
watch O
how O
the O
boy B-TER
threw O
up O
mud O
and O
dirt O
. O

Hitlerite B-TER
animals O
stood O
around O
him O
and O
swelled O
up O
with O
delight O
: O
– O
He O
did O
it O
well O
, O
he O
did O
it O
properly O
! O
... O
Several O
Germans B-TER
with O
whips B-TER
ran I-TER
after I-TER
the I-TER
people I-TER
who I-TER
had I-TER
to I-TER
overtake I-TER
the I-TER
bicycle I-TER
and O
each O
one O
who O
lagged O
behind O
was O
carried O
to O
a O
side O
half O
dead O
. O

An O
elderly O
Jews O
of O
approximately O
sixty O
years O
of O
age O
was O
not O
able O
to O
run O
after O
[ O
the O
bicycle O
] O
at O
all O
and O
lagged O
behind O
. O

For O
this O
, O
he O
was O
beaten O
up O
horribly O
and O
remained O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

Later O
, O
he O
disappeared O
entirely O
and O
nobody O
dared O
to O
ask O
where O
he O
is O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
reached O
the O
highest O
level O
of O
barbarity O
and O
lousiness O
with O
the O
so O
- O
called O
duel O
. O

They O
selected O
two O
victims B-TER
and O
commanded O
one O
of O
them O
to O
beat O
up O
the O
other O
. O

The O
one O
who O
beats O
and O
batters O
the O
other O
better O
will O
be O
released O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
the O
selected O
for O
this O
a O
Pole B-TER
and O
a O
Jew O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
their O
occupation B-TER
of O
Poland B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
large O
forced B-LOC
labor I-LOC
camp I-LOC
close I-LOC
to I-LOC
Mińsk I-LOC
Mazowiecki I-LOC
, O
the O
bandites O
applied O
all O
of O
these O
methods B-TER
of I-TER
humiliation I-TER
of O
the O
local O
residents O
and O
of O
reducing O
them O
to O
the O
level O
of O
persecuted O
dogs O
. O

In O
this O
very O
camp B-LOC
near I-LOC
Mińsk I-LOC
Mazowiecki I-LOC
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
for O
no O
reason O
, O
simply O
for O
entertainment O
and O
savage O
debauchery O
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
brother B-TER
of O
the O
friend O
of O
mine O
called O
V.K. O
from O
Otwock B-LOC
was O
murdered B-TER
there O
together O
with O
a O
Polish B-TER
worker B-TER
simply O
because O
they O
dared O
without O
asking O
to O
take O
shelter O
under O
a O
roof O
during O
a O
rain O
. O

Generally O
, O
the O
murder B-TER
of O
the O
local O
population O
by O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
cannibals O
became O
a O
daily O
phenomenon O
. O

The O
ease O
with O
with O
they O
did O
it O
was O
even O
more O
terrible O
and O
inhumane O
than O
the O
acts O
of O
murder B-TER
themselves I-TER
. O

With O
the O
very O
calmness O
with O
with O
one O
slaughters O
a O
little O
calf O
they O
massacred B-TER
two O
hundred O
people O
in O
Wawer B-LOC
, O
a O
shtetl B-LOC
south O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
simply O
because O
they O
had O
found O
the O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
of O
a O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
near O
Wawer B-LOC
. O

Two O
hundred O
for O
one O
– O
this O
is O
what O
the O
brown O
bandits O
decided O
, O
and O
in O
bright O
daylight O
, O
they O
strolled O
from O
house O
to O
house O
of O
the O
Wawer B-LOC
residents O
, O
who O
did O
not O
suspect O
anything O
, O
took O
out O
several O
people O
, O
even O
mothers B-TER
breastfeeding O
their O
children B-TER
, O
and O
shot B-TER
all I-TER
of I-TER
them I-TER
dead I-TER
. O

The O
most O
brutal O
and O
savage O
of O
all O
was O
the O
relationship O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
murderers B-TER
to O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

No O
normal O
person O
could O
think O
of O
such O
savage B-TER
humiliations I-TER
and I-TER
pranks I-TER
as O
the O
ones O
the O
bandits O
came O
up O
with O
. O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
here O
of O
the O
mass B-TER
massacre I-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
. O

As O
I O
was O
told O
later O
on O
, O
many O
much O
more O
horrible O
massacres B-TER
took O
place O
after O
I O
had O
escaped B-TER
from O
Hitler B-PER
’s I-PER
hell O
. O

But O
the O
one O
I O
am O
going O
to O
talk O
about O
remains O
engraved O
into O
my O
memory O
with O
an O
especially O
sharp O
pain O
. O

Two O
cities O
were O
famous O
for O
their O
comparative O
calmness O
and O
security O
: O
Chełm B-LOC
and O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
. O

The O
local O
commanders O
– O
Jews O
said O
– O
are O
good O
people O
and O
stick O
up O
for O
the O
residents O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
Chełm B-LOC
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
terrible O
event O
, O
I O
really O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
I O
was O
in O
a O
city B-LOC
in O
which O
endless O
numbers O
of O
crazy O
, O
exasperated O
dogs O
ran O
around O
, O
but O
with O
bridles O
around O
their O
muzzles O
. O

With O
malice O
and O
fury O
, O
the O
Hitler B-ORG
Youth I-ORG
and O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
jumped O
at O
each O
and O
every O
one O
– O
a O
push O
here O
, O
a O
curse O
there O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
go O
further O
. O

People O
were O
take O
to O
work O
according O
to O
a O
list O
. O

Many O
Jews O
from O
Chełm B-LOC
told O
me O
: O
it O
is O
indeed O
very O
miserable O
but O
we O
will O
persevere O
. O

Until O
this O
one O
Thursday O
evening O
when O
an O
order B-TER
was O
issued O
that O
tomorrow O
, O
on O
Friday O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
all O
men B-TER
of O
Jewish O
nationality O
between O
16 O
and O
60 O
of O
age O
shall O
gather O
in O
front O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
council I-LOC
. O

Who O
stays O
at O
home O
, O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
up O
to O
twelve O
hundred O
people O
gathered O
on O
the O
town B-LOC
square I-LOC
. O

Around O
10 O
am O
, O
they O
were O
surrounded O
by O
large O
divisions O
of O
soldiers B-TER
and O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
. O

They O
took O
the O
documents O
from O
everyone O
and O
tore O
them O
apart O
, O
and O
after O
that O
chased O
them O
to O
the O
road O
which O
leads O
to O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
. O

When O
after O
the O
first O
ten O
kilometers O
the O
elderly O
and O
weak O
started O
to O
lag O
behind O
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
bandits O
shot B-TER
them O
. O

Seeing O
that O
, O
many O
of O
the O
crowd O
started O
to O
run O
ahead O
and O
a O
terrible O
panic O
broke O
out O
. O

And O
this O
is O
exactly O
what O
the O
Fascist B-TER
murderers O
were O
waiting O
for O
. O

Without O
pause O
, O
they O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
people O
in O
the O
back O
with O
a O
savage O
enjoyment O
forcing O
the O
whole O
crowd O
in O
this O
way O
to O
run O
. O

Sensing O
death B-TER
in O
their O
backs O
, O
the O
people O
tore O
off O
their O
clothes B-TER
, O
mustered O
their O
last O
strengths O
, O
and O
went O
insane O
out O
of O
fear O
. O

Many O
threw O
themselves O
into O
the O
brooks O
they O
encountered O
on O
their O
way O
. O

But O
not O
everyone O
managed O
to O
do O
that O
. O

From O
Chełm B-LOC
to O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
it O
is O
fifty O
kilometers O
and O
this O
savage O
, O
bloody O
hunt O
persisted O
throughout O
the O
whole O
way O
. O

Toward O
evening O
, O
half O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
arrived O
in O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
all O
of O
them O
were O
locked O
in O
in O
a O
few O
barns O
and O
were O
prohibited O
to O
make O
any O
sound O
whatsoever O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
when O
they O
chased O
the O
Jews O
from O
Chełm B-LOC
to O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
, O
the O
commander O
in O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
issued O
the O
same O
decree B-TER
that O
tomorrow O
, O
i.e. O
on O
Shabbat O
morning O
, O
all O
Jews O
– O
men B-TER
between O
16 O
and O
60 O
years O
– O
have O
to O
gather O
at O
the O
town B-LOC
square I-LOC
. O

In O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
, O
the O
whole O
crowd O
arrived O
dressed O
up O
for O
the O
Shabbat O
, O
and O
the O
rabbis B-TER
and O
ritual O
slaughterers O
in O
shtraymlekh B-TER
Traditional O
round O
fur O
hat O
. O

and O
their O
long O
coarse O
coats B-TER
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
many O
could O
have O
still O
been O
saved O
because O
the O
Ukrainian B-TER
mayor O
of O
the O
city O
had O
whispered O
to O
the O
head O
of O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
that O
it O
looks O
bad O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

But O
the O
respectable O
Jew O
, O
instead O
of O
communicating O
this O
to O
everyone O
, O
saved O
his O
own O
skin O
first O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Only O
to O
those O
he O
bumped O
into O
on O
his O
way O
did O
he O
warn O
that O
they O
should O
run O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
approximately O
six O
hundred O
men B-TER
gathered O
in O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
– O
a O
crowd O
which O
they O
started O
to O
chase O
to O
the O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
together O
with O
the O
Jews O
from O
Chełm B-LOC
. O

Up O
to O
its O
knee O
in O
mud O
, O
the O
crowd O
dragged O
itself O
onward O
and O
onward O
for O
a O
whole O
day O
with O
great O
difficulties O
and O
united O
in O
agony O
. O

For O
the O
night O
, O
they O
were O
all O
chased O
into O
a O
muddy O
gutter O
at O
the O
side O
which O
reached O
up O
to O
the O
neck O
. O

In O
the O
night O
, O
forty O
men B-TER
died B-TER
, O
froze B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
or O
drowned B-TER
, O
among O
them O
all O
of O
the O
functionaries O
of O
Jewish B-TER
communal I-TER
life I-TER
in O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
the O
bloody O
hunt O
started O
again O
even O
with O
more O
savagery O
and O
cruelty O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
in O
a O
bandit O
- O
like O
way O
from O
behind O
, O
among O
them O
also O
my O
loyal O
friend O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
B. O
, O
and O
his O
father B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
, O
an O
elderly O
man B-TER
, O
whom O
he O
had O
to O
assist O
walking O
. O

The O
cannibals B-TER
were O
not O
satisfied O
with O
the O
shootings B-TER
on O
the O
way O
alone O
. O

Not O
far O
from O
the O
border B-TER
, O
in O
a O
grove O
, O
where O
they O
halted O
to O
rest O
a O
little O
, O
they O
played O
a O
little O
game O
simply O
for O
entertainment O
’s O
sake O
and O
shot B-TER
whomever O
they O
felt O
the O
urge O
to O
shoot B-TER
. O

They O
did O
the O
same O
thing O
right O
at O
the O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

They O
divided O
the O
eight O
hundred O
remaining O
individuals O
into O
two O
groups O
and O
they O
turned O
to O
the O
dejected O
group O
with O
the O
most O
disgraceful O
, O
cynical O
calmness O
saying O
: O
– O
So O
, O
now O
for O
our O
goodbyes O
, O
demonstrate O
your O
courage O
and O
name O
eleven O
volunteers O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

If O
not O
, O
we O
ourselves O
are O
going O
to O
select O
twice O
as O
many O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O
terrible O
massacre B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
Chełm B-LOC
and O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
the O
took O
place O
. O

When O
the O
population O
of O
Hrubieszów B-LOC
learned O
about O
happened O
to O
their O
very O
own O
from O
the O
few O
that O
had O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
– O
the O
women B-TER
, O
mothers B-TER
and O
children B-TER
– O
, O
the O
whole O
city O
broke O
out O
into O
a O
wild O
clamor O
. O

The O
good O
commander O
did O
prevent O
the O
women B-TER
and O
mothers B-TER
from O
crying O
in O
length O
. O

In O
order O
not O
to O
waste O
any O
time O
, O
he O
sent O
out O
people O
to O
collect O
the O
old O
taxes O
from O
Polish B-TER
times O
with O
all O
of O
his O
German B-TER

On O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
of O
Przemyśl B-LOC
, O
there O
is O
a O
fresh O
mass B-TER
grave I-TER
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
horrific O
document O
of O
the O
savage O
bestiality O
of O
our O
times O
. O

In O
the O
white O
stone O
, O
small O
tablets O
are O
attached O
on O
which O
the O
names O
of O
all O
those O

horrific O
way O
during O
the O
14 O

Who O

if O

this O

Ten O
little O

the O
mass B-TER
grave I-TER
are O
entirely O
empty O
, O
– O
no O
name O
is O
engraved O
on O
them O

They O
were O
people O
who O
did O
not O
have O
any O
documents O
on O
them O
, O
and O
their O
bodies B-TER
were O
so O
crumbled O
up O
that O
one O
could O
not O
establish O
who O
they O
were O
. O

In O
those O
terrible O
days O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
drove O
around O
the O
city B-LOC
like O
bloodthirsty O
rascals O
. O

They B-TER
snapped I-TER
up I-TER
people I-TER
they I-TER
coincidentally I-TER
bumped I-TER

arranged I-TER
them I-TER

gave O
the O
order O
hands O
on O
the O

let O
them O
stand O

this O
for O
several O
hours O

At O
the O

time O
, O
other O
Gestapo B-ORG

men I-ORG
entered O
different O
houses O

dragged O
out O

them O
, O
– O
very O
often O
it O
was O
sick B-TER
people O
dragged O
from O
their O
beds O
. O

They O
loaded O
the O
people O
group O
by O
group O
on O
trucks O
and O
drove O
them O
out O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
ostensibly O
to O
work B-TER
. O

No B-TER
one I-TER
of I-TER
them I-TER
came I-TER
back I-TER
alive I-TER
, O
however O
. O

There O
, O
they O
were O
arranged O
in O
rows O
of O
five O
. O

They O
ordered O
the O
first O
five O
to O
dig O
up O
graves O
for O
themselves O
, O
shot B-TER
at I-TER
them I-TER
with I-TER
dumdum I-TER

pulled I-TER
out I-TER

cut I-TER

The O

hastily O
bury B-TER
the O
dead B-TER
and O
prepare O
graves O
for O
themselves O
again O
until O
everyone O
was O
dead B-TER

This O
way O
, O
a O
father B-TER
had O
to O
witness O
the O
early O
death B-TER
of O
his O
son B-TER

a O

had O
to O

he O
himself O
perished B-TER
from O
the O
murderous B-TER

Only O
from O
one O

with O
the O

Soyfer B-PER

Grosman B-PER

person O

who O
did O
nothing O
else O
in O
his O
life O
than O
studying O
books O
, O
was O
dragged O
out O
from O
his O
sickbed B-TER

Ignoring O
the O
pleas O

of O
his O
old O
, O
disabled O

, O
who O
is O
not O
able O
to O

and O
for O
whom O
the O
son B-TER
was O
her O
only O
support O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
away O
and O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
summoned O
the O
70 O
- O
year O
old O
Nekhemye B-PER
Rozenboym I-PER
and O
informed O
him B-PER
that O
he O
has O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
burial B-TER
of O
the O
murdered B-TER
and O
at O
the O
very O
end O
a O
bullet B-TER
awaits I-TER
him I-TER
as I-TER
well I-TER
. O

They O
made O
Rozenboym B-PER
and O
several O
other O
Jews O
stand O
with O
their O
faces O
turned O
to O
the O
wall O
and O
ordered O
them O
to O
say O
vide O
confession O
of O
sin O
said O
collectively O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
and O
individually O
before O
dying O
. O

, O
because O
they O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
in O
15 O
minutes O
. O

While O
the O
Jews O
said O
vide O
, O
the O
murderers B-TER
prepared O
their O
rifles O
, O
whilst B-TER
making I-TER
fun I-TER
of O
their O
victims B-TER
, O
and O
made O
all O
necessary O
preparations O
for O
the O
execution B-TER
. O

Suddenly O
, O
they O
were O
summoned O
from O
someone O
and O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
left O
behind O
those O
sentenced O
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
move O
from O
the O
spot O
convinced O
that O
this O
is O
something O
of O
a O
new O
trick O
of O
the O
bloodhounds O
. O

When O
no O
one O
came O
back O
after O
some O
time O
, O
they O
left O
and O
to O
this O
day O
they O
can O
not O
say O
whether O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
intentionally O
plotted O
this O
game O
or O
whether O
they O
simply O
forgot O
about O
them O
because O
a O
new O
game O
came O
up O
. O

A O
woman B-TER
( O
I O
forgot O
her O
name O
) O
went O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
– O
she O
wanted O
to O
plead O
for O
the O
release O
of O
her O
husband B-TER
from O
their O
hands O
. O

So O
they O
suggested O
to O
her O
that O
she O
should O
bring O
ransom O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
four O
thousand O
Złoty O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
never O
in O
her O
life O
possessed O
such O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
, O
decided O
to O
do O
the O
impossible O
in O
order O
to O
save O
her O
husband B-TER
. O

She O
sold O
everything O
from O
her O
home O
, O
remained O
with O
one O
shirt B-TER
and O
one O
dress B-TER
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
suffice O
. O

So O
people O
pooled O
however O
much O
one O
could O
afford O
and O
we O
gathered O
the O
necessary O
sum O
of O
money O
. O

On O
the O
second O
day O
, O
the O
woman B-TER
came O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
with O
money O
. O

They O
took B-TER
the I-TER
money I-TER
from I-TER
her I-TER
and O
ordered O
her O
to O
come O
back O
tomorrow O
. O

Then O
they O
will O
release O
her O
husband B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
they O
ordered O
her O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
in O
the O
corridor O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
she O
heard O
from O
above O
her O
coming O
from O
the O
first O
floor O
a O
mocking O
laughter O
: O
Here O
you O
have O
your O
husband O
. O

Then O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
she O
saw O
something O
dark O
rolling O
down O
the O
stairs O
. O

The O
horribly O
mutilated O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
of O
her O
husband B-TER
rolled O
towards O
her O
feet O
. O

It O
became O
clear O
that O
at O
the O
point O
that O
they O
conducted O
the O
negotiations O
regarding O
the O
ransom O
with O
the O
woman B-TER
, O
her O
husband B-TER
had O
already O
not O
been O
alive O
anymore O
. O

In O
those O
days O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Przemyśl B-LOC
alone O
580 O
people O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

Only O
a O
part O
of O
them O
have O
been O
able O
to O
be O
buried B-TER
so O
far O
– O
168 O
, O
because O
the O
Nazis B-TER
did O
not O
kill B-TER
their O
victims B-TER
in O
one O
place O
but O
dragged O
them O
into O
woods O
and O
to O
fields O
and O
deserted O
mountains O
. O

Those O
, O
who O
were O
found O
, O
were O
found O
thanks O
to O
the O
peasants O
who O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
left O
pointed O
to O
the O
locations O
from O
where O
wild O
clamor O
and O
shootings O
were O
heard O
. O

Women B-TER

mothers B-TER
, O
daughters B-TER

fathers B-TER
, O
sons B-TER

around O
the O

, O
teared O
open O
the O
freshly O

searched O

with O
teared O

out O

out O

cut O

it O
was O
difficult O

to O
recognize O
the O
former O
individuals O

In O
the O
small O
shtetl O
Dynów B-LOC

the O
Hitlerites B-TER

that O
she O
went O
insane O

She O
was O
in O

in O

In O
the O
city O
Przemyśl B-LOC

the O
Hitlerites B-TER
set O
the O
old O
synagogue B-TER
from O
the O
15th O
century O
on O
fire B-TER
, O
which O
was O
of O
great O
artistic O
value O
. O

When O
the O
firemen O
started O
to O
extinguish O
the O
fire O
, O
Nazis B-TER
came O
running O
and O
cut O
open O
the O

with O
knives O
. O

In O
the O
city O
of O
Jarosław B-LOC
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
general O
was O
killed B-TER
. O

Since O
no O
traces O

the O
one O

it O
could O
be O
found O
, O
all O
Polish B-TER
students B-TER
of O

and O
every O

We O
know O
little O
about O
the O
things O

are O
happening O
right O

In O

like O
in O
all O

the O

up O

Whilst O
catching O

during O
the O

itself O

the O
Hitlerites B-TER
made O

out I-TER

In O
this O

the O

It O
was O

I O
came O
across O
such O
facts O
of O

in O
Poland B-LOC
a O
lot O

In O
general O

the O
Hitlerites B-TER
love O

In O

the O
following O
episode O
took O
place O

A O
large O
number O

up O

A O

preserved O
this O

Afterwards O
, O
it O

Why O

they O
pray O

– O
they O
are O
allowed O
to O
pray O
as O
much O
as O
they O
want O
… O
Hitler B-PER
’s O
propagandists B-TER
did O
not O
tell O
anyone O
, O
though O
, O
about O
the O
horrific O
fact O
that O
these O
very O
Jews O
who O
they O
had O
first O
taken O
photos B-TER
of O
, O
were O
arranged O
in O
rows O
immediately O
after O
the O
photo B-TER
- I-TER
session I-TER
and O
… O
shot B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

I O
was O
also O
told O
that O
in O
many O
Polish B-TER
shtetlekh O
the O
Germans B-TER
entertained B-TER
themselves O
with O
placing O
rabbis B-TER
on O
wodden B-TER
mares I-TER
in I-TER
the I-TER
middle I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
market I-TER
square I-TER
. O

The O
rabbis B-TER
were O
riding O
, O
dressed O
in O
shtraymlekh B-TER
round O
fur O
hat O
worn O
by O
orthodox O
Jews O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
and O
holidays O
. O

on O
their O
heads O
, O
and O
old O
chassidim O
were O
standing O
beside O
them O
with O
brooms O
in O
their O
hands O
… O
The O
rabbi B-TER
had O
to O
hold O
a O
banner O
in O
his O
hand O
with O
the O
inscription O
: O
We O
, O
the O
damned O
Jews O
, O
wanted O
the O
war O
. O

In O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
this O
equals O
… O
humor O
and O
satire O
. O

And O
here O
we O
have O
another O
example O
for O
their O
bandit O
- O
like O
humor O
. O

One O
day O
, O
an O
old O
acquainted O
Jewish B-TER
lawyer I-TER
was O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
weak O
, O
nearsighted O
man B-TER
. O

So O
he O
was O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
… I-TER
to O
carry B-TER
coals I-TER
from I-TER
one I-TER
spot I-TER
to I-TER
another I-TER
and I-TER
back I-TER
. O

Once O
this O
work O
was O
done O
, O
the O
quartermaster O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
complex O
occupation O
for O
him O
. O

He O
drags O
him O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
four O
- O
story O
building O
and O
forces O
him O
… O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
chimney I-TER
with O
his O
hands O
. O

When O
the O
lawyer B-TER
was O
smeared O
with O
soot O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
, O
a O
photographer B-TER
showed O
up O
unexpectedly O
, O
who O
had O
to O
immortalize B-TER
the I-TER
image I-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
, O
dirty O
as O
he O
was O
, O
was O
placed O
in O
front O
of O
the O
wall O
and O
ordered O
to O
laugh O
… O
– O
You O
should O
laugh O
Jewishly O
! O
– O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
commanded O
. O

The O
tortured B-TER
lawyer B-TER
did O
not O
understand O
what O
to O
laugh O
Jewishly O
means O
. O

So O
the O
quartermaster O
goes O
up O
to O
his O
victim B-TER
, O
sticks O
in O
two O
Aryan O
fingers O
into O
his O
mouth O
, O
rips O
open O
his O
lips O
and O
… O
takes O
a O
picture O
. O

The O
representatives O
of O
the O
chosen O
race O
did O
the O
following O
in O
the O
shtetl O
Włodawa B-LOC
: O
They O
spread O
an O
announcement O
that O
tomorrow O
at O
7 O
am O
sharp O
all O
old O
, O
sick B-TER
and O
disabled B-TER
people I-TER
from O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
are O
summoned O
to O
come O
and O
register B-TER
– O
they O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
sanatorium O
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
at O
7 O
am O
sharp O
, O
approximately O
200 O
men B-TER
come O
and O
register B-TER
. O

They O
are O
all O
disabled B-TER
, O
sick B-TER
and O
old O
people O
. O

They O
were O
arranged O
in O
a O
line O
, O
and O
with O
the O
help O
of O
machine O
guns O
… O
they O
are O
sent O
away O
to O
the O
mentioned O
sanatorium O
, O
from O
which O
no B-TER
one I-TER
ever I-TER
comes I-TER
back I-TER
. O

Their O
humor O
has O
a O
diabolic O
nature O
. O

On O
some O
Friday O
, O
25 O
Jews O
were O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
in O
broad O
daylight O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
standing O
outside O
guarded O
by O
a O
sentinel O
and O
wait O
. O

They O
wait O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
, O
a O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
exits O
the O
building O
in O
a O
blindingly O
white O
apron O
and O
commands O
that O
one O
Jew O
of O
the O
25 O
shall O
come O
with O
him O
. O

It O
takes O
two O
minutes O
and O
the O
soldier B-TER
comes O
back O
out O
again O
on O
his O
own O
… O
but O
with O
his O
apron O
soaked O
in O
blood O
, O
with O
bloody O
hands O
… O
He O
commands O
a O
second O
Jew O
to O
follow O
him O
immediately O
. O

This O
makes O
a O
terrifying O
impression O
on O
the O
Jews O
. O

They O
go O
cold O
and O
are O
seized O
by O
a O
saddening O
deathly B-TER
fear O
. O

One O
of O
them O
goes O
insane O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
others O
lose O
consciousness O
, O
one O
dies B-TER
there O
from O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

The O
others O
one O
after O
the O
other O
followed O
that O
same O
soldier B-TER
inside O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
this O
sadistic O
procedure O
consisted O
of O
was O
that O
the O
soldier B-TER
slaughtered O
geese O
and O
he O
called O
upon O
the O
Jews O
to O
pluck O
the O
down O
from O
feathers O
... O
The O
young O
female O
physician B-TER
Sh O
. O

was O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
toilets I-TER
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
with O
her O
hands O
. O

She O
did O
it O
. O

The O
soldier B-TER
was O
not O
pleased O
with O
her O
work B-TER
, O
however O
. O

So O
he O
gives O
her O
a O
bucket O
with O
hydrochloric O
acid O
and O
a O
rag O
and O
orders O
her O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
toilets I-TER
with O
it O
. O

From O
the O
hydrochloric O
acid O
, O
the O
young O
girl B-TER
’s I-TER
hands O
are O
burning O
. O

She O
cries O
bitterly O
… O
Then O
, O
the O
soldier B-TER
takes O
the O
rag O
, O
immerses O
it O
into O
the O
hydrochloric O
acid O
and O
wipes O
off O
the O
physician B-TER
’s I-TER
tears O
with O
it O
… O
together O
with O
her O
eyes O
. O

More O
than O
once O
did O
it O
come O
to O
pass O
that O
I O
as O
well O
as O
hundreds O
of O
unfortunate O
Jews O
had O
to O
walk O
around O
aimlessly O
, O
without O
purpose O
, O
for O
dozens O
of O
kilometres O
because O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Hilterite B-TER
blood O
suckers O
wanted O
. O

For O
them O
, O
it O
was O
a O
game B-TER
, I-TER
a I-TER
spiritual I-TER
pleasure I-TER
, I-TER
an I-TER
entertainment I-TER
, O
and O
we O
felt O
as O
if O
our O
hearts O
were O
falling O
out O
. O

As O
if O
our O
knees O
become O
weak O
. O

And O
the O
more O
tired O
we O
were O
, O
the O
more O
reckless O
their O
state O
was O
, O
all O
the O
more O
they O
ridiculed B-TER
and O
tortured B-TER
us O
. O

When O
we O
were O
running O
( O
in O
their O
language O
this O
is O
called O
gymnastics O
) O
, O
they O
were O
chasing O
us O
with O
sticks O
and O
revolvers O
in O
their O
hands O
. O

They O
were O
very O
violent O
. O

– O
Hop O

hop O

Run O

On O
a O
cold O
autumn O
day O
, O
we O
drove O
to O
the O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

We O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
bloody O
Hitlerite B-TER
axe O
. O

When O
our O
truck O
travelled O
for O
some O
time O
from O
Radzymin B-LOC
( O
near O
Warsaw B-LOC
) O
, O
three O
armed O
Hitler B-PER
- O
soldiers B-TER
stopped O
us O
. O

– O
Stop O
, O
stand O
still O
! O
– O
They O
were O
screaming O
out O
loud O
. O

Our O
car O
stopped O
. O

– O
Men B-TER
, O
out O
! O
So O
the O
ten O
men B-TER
disembarked O
and O
took O
out O
the O
luggage O
. O

The O
famous O
inspection O
of O
the O
luggage O
started O
. O

They B-TER
immediately I-TER
took I-TER
several I-TER
things I-TER
from I-TER
it I-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
did O
individual O
inspections O
. O

One O
of O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
examines O
me O
. O

Where O
is O
, O
I O
am O
supposed O
to O
tell O
him O
, O
the O
rifle O
which O
I O
hide B-TER
from O
the O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
? O
The O
German B-TER
is O
not O
able O
to O
find O
any O
rifle O
on O
me O
. O

But O
looking O
at O
my O
warm O
coat B-TER
which O
I O
wear O
, O
he O
says O
with O
a O
smile O
: O
– O
You O
are O
cold O
, O
right O
? O
Do O
n’t O
worry O
, O
you O
will O
be O
warm O
soon O
… O
Naturally O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
heard O
this O
, O
I O
got O
very O
warm O
. O

This O
characteristic O
episode O
ended O
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
three O
commanded O
that O
we O
place O
our O
things O
on O
the O
car O
while O
we O
stay O
below O
. O

He O
further O
commanded O
the O
driver O
to O
drive O
100 O
metres O
. O

When O
all O
of O
this O
was O
done O
, O
he O
slowly O
took O
out O
a O
gun O
from O
his O
case O
, O
pointed O
at O
us O
and O
suddenly O
barked O
at O
us O
. O

– O
Damned O
Jews O
, O
run O
! O
The O
last O
one O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
! O
And O
ten O
Jews O
, O
grown O
- O
ups O
, O
elderlies O
, O
started O
running O
like O
crazy O
… O
Of O
our O
belongings O
, O
we O
did O
not O
see O
any O
of O
it O
anymore O
, O
of O
course O
… O
We O
were O
nonetheless O
happy O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
from O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
hell O
alive O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
convey O
the O
horror O
that O
I O
was O
seized O
by O

Yet O
, O
the O
desperate O
situation O
forced O
me O
, O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER

to O
stay O
in O
Kharkiv B-LOC

The O
Fascist B-TER
demonstrated O
what O
they O
were O
capable O
of O
already O
on O
the O
very O
first O
day O
. O

On O
the O
squares B-LOC

The O
next O

the O
Germans B-TER

to O

One O
was O
not O

Every O
moment O

you O

hear O
a O

Open O
up O

They B-TER
usually I-TER
took I-TER
everything I-TER

After O

they O
started O

there O
was O
a O

there O

I O
passed O
by O
to O

And O
suddenly O
we O
saw O
how O
from O
the O
highest O
floor O
of O
the O
building O
they O
let O
down O
a O
young O
man B-TER
on O
a O
rope B-TER
. O

At O
first O
we O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
it O

A O
heartrending O
cry O
was O
heard O
: O
Help O

The O

remained O
hanging B-TER

The O

This O
was O
the O
morning O
after O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
dream O
, O
as O
if O
my O
dream O
gave O
me O
a O
foreboding O
about O
the O
future O
. O

They O
demanded O
that O
my O
building B-LOC
provides O
10 O
Jews O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
among O
them O
. O

After O
the O
people O
finished O
the O
work B-TER
, O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
International O
as O
hostages B-TER
. O

I O
began O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
turn O
. O

On O
December O
15 O
, O
they O
wanted O
all O
Jews O
of O
our O
building B-LOC
as O
hostages B-TER
. O

I O
decided O
that O
I O
wo O
n’t O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
murderers B-TER
alive O
and O
that O
I O
will O
commit B-TER
suicide I-TER
instead O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
poison O
, O
but O
I O
found O
a O
razorblade O
. O

Ten O
times O
I O
cut O
my O
wrist O
with O
the O
blade O
, O
but O
due O
to O
my O
inexperience O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
reach O
the O
vein O
. O

From O
the O
loss O
of O
blood O
I O
lost O
consciousness O
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
from O
a O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
notified O
me O
that O
today O
is O
December O
15 O
, O
1941 O
: O
all O
Jews O
are O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O

move O

which O
are O
behind O
the O

12 O
kilometres O

from O
Kharkiv B-LOC

The O
blood O
ran O
from O
my O
wound O
, O
I O
hardly O
understood O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
describe O
the O
image O
– O
15 O
thousand O
people O
, O
or O
even O
more O
, O
walked O
on O
Staro B-LOC

The O

from O

In O
the O
evening O

we O
arrived O
at O
our O
new O

I O
entered O
the O
barrack O

Instead O

I O

I O
regained O
consciousness O

a O

a O

crying O

There O
were O

it O
was O
very O
cramped O
, O
and O
in O
the O
darkness O
someone O
fell O
on O
top O
of O
the O
woman B-TER
with O
an O
infant O
. O

The O
baby B-TER
cried O
. O

When O
the O
mother B-TER
saw O
that O
the O
child B-TER
stopped O
moving O
, O
she O
started O
screaming O
: O
Help O
! O
This O
is O
all O
that O
is O
left O
to O
me O
– O
my O
husband O
and O
son O
were O
hanged O
. O

What O
could O
we O
do O
, O
though O
? O
Turning O
on O
the O
lights O
was O
prohibited O
. O

The O
baby B-TER
died O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
bad O
barrack O
. O

We O
were O
fifty O
people O
. O

Some O
were O
lucky O
– O
they O
bought O
bunk O
beds O
. O

On O
each O
bunk O
, O
5–6 O
men B-TER
were O
laying O
. O

It O
was O
bitterly O
cold O
. O

I O
slept O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

My O
hands O
and O
feet O
froze O
from O
the O
cold O
. O

Another O
misfortune O
was O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O

I O
have O
just O
one O
sister B-TER
. O

A O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
30 O
years O
to O
be O
exact O
, O
she O
converted O
to O
Christianity B-TER
and O
in O
her O
passport B-TER
she O
is O
registered O
as O
Russian B-TER
. O

I O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
thought O
about O
the O
past O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
turned O
around O
, O
as O
if O
somebody O
pushed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
my O
only O
dear O
sister B-TER
. O

Four O
days O
, O
she O
sat O
with O
me O
in O
the O
barrack O
. O

There O
were O
good O
people O
around O
, O
who O
helped O
her O
, O
and O
she O
escaped B-TER
. O

She O
had O
a O
Russianpassport O
after O
all O
and O
it O
was O
easier O
to O
help O
her O
than O
me O
. O

We O
did O
not O
say O
goodbye O
properly O
, O
so O
she O
would O
not O
turn O
around O
. O

I O
only O
looked O
at O
her O
and O
wanted O
to O
hand O
over O
everything O
to O
her O
with O
this O
one O
look O
. O

The O
wound O
on O
my O
wrist O
did O
not O
close O
. O

I O
was O
suffering O
from O
the O
cold O
and O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
would O
usually O
let O
us O
go O
to O
the O
market O
or O
to O
get O
water O
if O
we O
gave O
things O
in O
return O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
continuously O
killed B-TER
people O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
a O
boy B-TER
was O
walking O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
yelled O
to O
him O
: O
Ey O
, O
Jude O
! O
When O
the O
boy B-TER
approached O
them O
, O
a O
German B-TER
threw O
him O
into O
a O
pit B-TER
and O
pressed O
his O
foot O
onto O
him O
, O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
him I-TER
dead I-TER
. O

Before O
the O
decree B-TER
was O
issued O
that O
everyone O
should O
be O
shot B-TER
, O
they O
usually O
killed B-TER
around O
fifty O
people O
every O
day O
. O

Once O
they O
announced O
: O
If O
we O
hear O
children O
cry O
during O
the O
night O
, O
we O
will O
shoot O
everyone O
. O

But O
how O
can O
you O
demand O
from O
a O
baby B-TER
not O
to O
cry O
? O
They O
could O
not O
be O
diapered O
, O
they O
were O
laying O
wet O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

The O
mothers B-TER
’ I-TER
milk O
had O
dried O
up O
from O
all O
the O
hardships O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
nurse O
them O
with O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
change O
barracks O
– O
no O
. O

9 O
. O

This O
barrack O
was O
lucky O
: O
it O
was O
the O
last O
in O
line O
for O
the O
massacre B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
tried O
to O
swindle O
us O
into O
going O
to O
the O
massacre B-TER
. O

In O
the O
third O
week O
, O
they O
announced O
: O
those O
, O
who O
want O
to O
be O
drafted O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Poltava B-LOC
, O
Lubny B-LOC
and O
Romny B-LOC
, O
should O
go O
in O
front O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
a O
needle O
stung O
into O
my O
heart O
and O
I O
remembered O
my O
bad O
dream O
. O

800 O
men B-TER
signed O
up O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
they O
were O
put O
into O
trucks O
. O

They O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
anything O
. O

Soon O
enough O
, O
we O
heard O
a O
shootout B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
they O
already O
no O
longer O
asked O
who O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

They O
snapped O
up O
women B-TER
, O
tore O
them O
away O
from O
their O
children B-TER
and O
threw O
them O
into O
the O
trucks O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
chased O
on O
foot O
. O

I O
gathered O
the O
last O
drop O
of O
strength O
and O
went O
into O
the O
adjacent O
barrack O
. O

I O
entered O
hell O
: O
dead B-TER
people I-TER
, O
dishes O
, O
down O
from O
the O
pillows O
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
food B-TER
, O
everything O
mixed O
up O
. O

In O
one O
corner O
, O
a O
dead O
woman B-TER
lay O
on O
a O
bed O
with O
her O
hand O
dangling O
, O
and O
a O
small O
child B-TER
was O
sucking O
on O
her O
dead O
fingers O
. O

In O
the O
other O
corner O
, O
a O
dead B-TER
old B-TER
man I-TER
was O
lying O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
quite O
remember O
how O
I O
made O
it O
to O
my O
barrack O
. O

I O
just O
really O
wanted O
to O
live O
. O

I O
envied O
a O
dog O
, O
a O
cat O
– O
they O
had O
the O
right O
to O
live O
, O
nobody O
hunted O
them O
down O
, O
and O
I O
, O
simply O
because O
I O
am O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
, O
I O
have O
to O
die B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
from O
the O
early O
morning O
hours O
, O
we O
sat O
and O
waited O
for O
our O
death B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
we O
had O
a O
moment O
of O
respite O
. O

From O
the O
direction O
of O
Saltiv B-LOC
, O
a O
cannon O
shootout B-TER
could O
be O
heard O
. O

The O
doomed O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
our O
army O
. O

They O
said O
: O
They O
will O
save O
us O
and O
embraced O
each O
other O
and O
cried O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
I O
have O
strong O
nerves O
since O
I O
endured O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
day O
next O
to O
last O
arrived O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
a O
young O
pregnant O
woman B-TER
was O
brought O
into O
our O
barrack O
. O

When O
she O
learned O
that O
she O
will O
be O
killed B-TER
tomorrow O
together O
with O
everyone O
else O
, O
she O
started O
to O
be O
in O
labor O
. O

I O
could O
not O
sleep O
because O
of O
her O
cries O
. O

In O
this O
very O
night O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
. O

At O
dawn O
, O
I O
got O
ready O
. O

I O
put O
a O
bedsheet O
into O
the O
pocket O
of O
my O
coat B-TER
in O
order O
to O
bandage O
my O
wound O
again O
and O
went B-TER
off I-TER
. O

At O
every O
turn O
, O
there O
were O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
with O
guns O
. O

What O
to O
do O
, O
where O
to O
go O
? O
They O
will O
kill B-TER
you O
either O
way O
… O
There O
was O
no O
time O
to O
think O
things O
through O
, O
every O
second O
was O
precious O
. O

Right O
this O
second O
, O
an O
officer O
called O
out O
to O
the O
soldiers B-TER
to O
sort O
through O
the O
things O
of O
the O
Jews O
which O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
truck O
. O

I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
crawled O
towards O
the O
ravine O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
turned O
around O
. O

I O
crawled O
into O
the O
snow O
and O
covered O
myself O
with O
the O
bedsheet O
. O

I O
lay O
like O
this O
on O
the O
frozen O
ground O
in O
minus O
forty O
degrees O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
it O
dawned O
, O
I O
started O
to O
crawl O
and O
reached O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
ravine O
, O
with O
great O
effort O
I O
crawled O
all O
over O
. O

It O
was O
bitterly O
cold O
, O
and O
there O
were O
not O
patrols O
standing O
beside O
the O
ravine O
. O

My O
heart O
was O
throbbing O
when O
I O
walked O
through O
the O
village B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
of O
every O
look O
. O

Where O
should O
I O
go O
? O
People O
will O
surely O
be O
afraid O
to O
let O
me O
in O
since O
you O
get O
the O
death B-TER
penalty O
for O
it O
. O

My O
closest O
friends O
were O
the O
family B-TER
of O
Kyril B-PER
Arsentyevitsh I-PER
Redko I-PER
. O

They O
hid B-TER
Jews O
risking O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
were O
denounced O
and O
almost O
got O
killed B-TER
. O

I O
knew O
about O
this O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
get O
them O
into O
trouble O
. O

So O
where O
should O
I O
go O
? O
It O
is O
almost O
nighttime O
. O

I O
wo O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

I O
found O
a O
public O
toilet O
which O
consisted O
of O
three O
cabins O
. O

There O
, O
I O
stayed O
for O
three O
days O
and O
four O
nights O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
the O
horror O
. O

It O
was O
terribly O
cold O
, O
the O
wind O
blew O
through O
every O
crack O
. O

I O
had O
frost O
bites O
all O
over O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
bread B-TER
, O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
. O

Every O
minute O
somebody O
could O
have O
found O
me O
. O

On O
the O
fourth O
day O
, O
I O
started O
to O
freeze B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
felt O
warm O
. O

I O
heard O
how O
I O
said O
: O
Water O
! O
A O
bit O
of O
water O
! O
... O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
I O
made O
it O
through O
to O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Exceeding O
all O
strengths O
, O
I O
got O
up O
from O
the O
dirty O
floor O
and O
went O
out O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kyril B-PER
Arsentyevitsh I-PER
. O

I O
kept O
falling O
down O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
they O
lived O
close O
to O
the O
location O
where O
I O
had O
taken O
refuge B-TER
. O

They O
received O
me O
warmly O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
three O
days O
. O

When O
I O
recovered O
a O
little O
, O
I O
felt O
again O
that O
I O
am O
a O
human O
being O
equal O
to O
all O
others O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
food B-TER
and O
with O
a O
broken O
heart O
said O
goodbye O
to O
me O
. O

My O
feet O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
on O
anymore O
. O

They O
felt O
like O
wooden O
blocks O
. O

I O
set O
out O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
a O
horrible O
thing O
to O
be O
on O
one O
’s O
way O
without O
knowing O
where O
to O
. O

Who O
will O
take O
me O
in O
? O
Who O
needs O
me O
? O
With O
difficulty O
, O
I O
made O
it O
to O
Korotysh B-LOC
. O

I O
entered O
several O
cottages O
, O
requested O
to O
stay O
for O
the O
night O
, O
but O
was O
turned O
down O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
find O
a O
place O
where O
nobody O
would O
notice O
me O
and O
to O
freeze B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
there O
. O

But O
before O
that O
I O
went O
into O
the O
last O
cottage O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
, O
they O
let O
me O
stay O
for O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
there O
was O
a O
big O
snowstorm O
and O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
house O
felt O
sorry O
for O
me O
and O
let O
me O
stay O
with O
them O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
three O
weeks O
. O

Germans B-TER
often O
came O
to O
the O
cottage O
. O

They O
were O
looking O
for O
partisans B-TER
, O
but O
they O
miraculously O
did O
not O
find O
me O
. O

Eventually O
, O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
them O
as O
well O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
walk O
, O
however O
. O

My O
feet O
had O
turned O
into O
a O
black O
, O
purulent O
mass O
. O

Before O
I O
departed O
, O
the O
homeowner O
’s O
mother B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
said O
to O
me O
: O
Wait O
. O

She O
escorted O
me O
to O
the O
doctor B-TER
in O
the O
cottage O
laboratory O
. O

He O
examined O
me O
and O
said O
: O
Your O
feet O
are O
lost O
. O

This O
felt O
like O
a O
second O
death B-TER
sentence O
. O

What O
shall O
I O
do O
in O
my O
situation O
without O
feet O
? O
I O
want O
to O
relate O
something O
about O
the O
doctor B-TER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
his O
family B-TER
name O
but O
he O
was O
called O
Petro O
. O

He O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
and O
used O
to O
come O
to O
renew O
my O
compresses O
. O

This O
was O
a O
wonderful O
Soviet B-TER
person O
. O

He O
suspected O
who O
I O
was O
. O

When O
the O
nurse B-TER
whispered O
something O
to O
him O
while O
writing O
down O
my O
family B-TER
name O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
This O
is O
not O
relevant O
to O
us O
. O

Our O
responsibility O
is O
to O
help O
this O
woman O
. O

And O
so O
I O
lay O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
. O

For O
me O
, O
it O
was O
paradise O
. O

I O
lay O
on O
a O
soft O
bed O
, O
nobody O
chased O
me O
away O
. O

I O
was O
given O
food B-TER
twice O
a O
day O
. O

And O
even O
if O
this O
was O
not O
much O
, O
it O
was O
at O
least O
a O
warm O
meal O
. O

I O
remained O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
like O
this O
for O
six O
months O
– O
from O
February O
7 O
, O
1942 O
, O
to O
July O
2 O
, O
1942 O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
: O
when O
I O
was O
hospitalized B-TER
, O
they O
did O
not O
look O
at O
my O
passport B-TER
. O

And O
I O
did O
not O
let O
go O
of O
the O
passport B-TER
the O
whole O
time O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
it O
in O
between O
the O
mattresses O
. O

I O
feel O
terrible O
when O
I O
think O
about O
how O
they O
amputated O
the O
toes O
of O
both O
my O
feet O
and O
after O
that O
cut O
off O
the O
inner O
bones O
. O

After O
a O
month O
, O
I O
got O
a O
fever O
– O
40 O
degree O
. O

I O
could O
only O
lay O
on O
my O
back O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
sleep O
because O
of O
the O
pain O
. O

I O
only O
wanted O
one O
thing O
– O
to O
die B-TER
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
. O

When O
the O
hospital B-TER
releases O
me O
– O
where O
will O
I O
go O
? O
I O
envied O
every O
dying O
person O
. O

Then O
I O
understood O
how O
lucky O
people O
are O
who O
die B-TER
a O
natural O
death B-TER
. O

When O
sick B-TER
people O
were O
brought O
in O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
, O
I O
usually O
hid B-TER
my O
face O
under O
the O
blanket O
and O
looked O
out O
with O
just O
one O
eye O
– O
what O
if O
I O
see O
a O
familiar O
face O
? O
The O
staff B-TER
treated O
me O
really O
well O
, O
helped O
me O
in O
any O
way O
they O
could O
. O

The O
surgeon B-TER
also O
gave O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
. O

In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
in O
this O
hospital B-TER
that O
I O
found O
my O
salvation O
. O

Once O
, O
a O
sick B-TER
woman B-TER
was O
brought O
in O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
severely O
ill B-TER
and O
soon O
died B-TER
. O

She O
was O
38 O
years O
old O
. O

I O
had O
just O
one O
thought O
on O
my O
mind O
– O
her O
passport B-TER
could O
save O
my O
life O
. O

And O
I O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
this O
very O
passport B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
released O
from O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
stayed O
with O
a O
hospital B-TER
nurse B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

After O
that O
time O
, O
I O
went O
on O
my O
way O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
and O
find O
my O
sister B-TER
. O

I O
guessed O
where O
she O
might O
have O
gone O
to O
. O

The O
way O
to O
get O
there O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
one O
, O
though O
. O

The O
wounds O
on O
my O
feet O
had O
not O
healed O
yet O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
by O
foot O
, O
hungry B-TER
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
Mertshik B-LOC
, O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
could O
not O
go O
on O
– O
I O
was O
too O
weak O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
on O
a O
train B-TER
, O
but O
a O
German B-TER
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
have O
a O
passage O
permit O
. O

He O
threw O
me O
out O
of O
the O
wagon O
. O

A O
policeman B-TER
advised O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
commander O
to O
get O
the O
passage O
permit O
. O

The O
commander O
, O
however O
, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
wild O
animal O
, O
not O
a O
human O
being O
. O

He O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
me O
to O
the O
end O
and O
started O
screaming O
: O
To O
hell O
! O
Get O
out O
. O

I O
sat O
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
the O
building O
where O
train B-TER
workers O
lived O
. O

I O
met O
a O
kind O
- O
hearted O
woman B-TER
there O
. O

She O
fed O
me O
and O
let O
me O
stay O
over O
night O
. O

She O
also O
helped O
me O
obtain O
a O
passage O
permit O
. O

I O
could O
not O
imagine O
the O
happiness O
I O
would O
feel O
– O
is O
it O
possible O
that O
I O
will O
see O
my O
only O
, O
my O
dearest O
sister B-TER
soon O
? O
Maybe O
these O
animals O
killed B-TER
her O
? O
The O
train B-TER
departed O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
corner O
so O
that O
nobody O
catches O
sight O
of O
me O
. O

At O
2 O
pm O
, O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
shtetl O
Smorodyne B-LOC
. O

I O
crossed O
the O
street O
and O
suddenly O
I O
understood O
that O
I O
wo O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
find O
my O
sister B-TER
– O
after O
all O
, O
I O
can O
not O
inquire O
about O
her O
since O
this O
will O
arouse O
suspicion O
. O

Some O
woman B-TER
noticed O
how O
lost O
I O
was O
. O

She O
asked O
: O
What O
is O
with O
you O
? O
I O
replied O
that O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
hungry B-TER
. O

She O
took O
me O
to O
her O
home O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
food B-TER
, O
bread B-TER
. O

I O
threw O
myself O
on O
it O
. O

I O
was O
blushing O
out O
of O
shame O
. O

I O
said O
: O
Pardon O
me O
. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
finish O
one O
meal O
, O
not O
more O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
one O
and O
a O
half O
months O
, O
cooked O
for O
them O
, O
cleaned O
the O
house O
. O

This O
woman B-TER
played O
a O
big O
role O
in O
my O
life O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
she O
is O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
my O
sister B-TER
. O

How O
should O
I O
convey O
to O
you O
our O
reunion O
? O
I O
wanted O
to O
throw O
myself O
at O
my O
sister B-TER
, O
to O
embrace O
her O
, O
to O
kiss O
her O
– O
I O
was O
convinced O
after O
all O
that O
she O
had O
died B-TER
, O
and O
she O
– O
that O
I O
was O
long O
gone O
. O

Yet O
, O
our O
conversation O
was O
cold O
. O

We O
pretended O
that O
we O
do O
n’t O
really O
know O
each O
other O
. O

We O
had O
to O
have O
iron O
patience O
to O
persevere O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
Smorodyne B-LOC
for O
one O
year O
and O
three O
months O
. O

I O
was O
as O
a O
chef O
, O
a O
nanny O
, O
a O
beggar O
and O
lingered O
in O
different O
corners O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

I O
saw O
how O
the O
German B-TER
barbarians O
took O
revenge O
on O
the O
youth O
. O

Immediately O
after O
examining O
them O
, O
they O
confined O
them O
in O
a O
special O
building B-LOC
and O
they O
would O
n’t O
even O
allow O
them O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
their O
families B-TER
. O

Relatives O
used O
to O
run O
after O
them O
, O
and O
the O
bandits O
used O
to O
shoot B-TER
at O
them O
in O
turn O
. O

There O
were O
many O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
teenagers B-TER
maimed O
themselves O
or O
committed B-TER
suicide I-TER
everything O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Germany B-TER
. O

It O
was O
usually O
a O
horrific O
scene O
when O
trains B-TER
departed O
. O

The O
train B-TER
station O
trembled O
from O
the O
cries O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
children B-TER
screamed O
: O
Where O
do O
you O
take O
us O
to O
, O
murderers O
? O
The O
relatives O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
approach O
the O
train B-TER
. O

The O
front O
came O
closer O
. O

For O
two O
weeks O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
basement O
. O

Two O
written O
orders O
were O
sent O
to O
our O
house O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
our O
army B-TER
entered O
Smorodyne B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
! O
Ours O
! O
So O
I O
returned O
home O
– O
to O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

I O
can O
walk O
around O
freely O
and O
look O
everyone O
in O
the O
eyes O
… O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
after O
all O
of O
the O
things O
I O
have O
experienced O
, O
I O
love O
our O
homeland O
even O
stronger O
. O

This O
is O
a O
country O
in O
which O
every O
human O
being O
has O
the O
right O
to O
live O

in O
the O

I O
was O

four O
camps B-TER

in O

Siverskyi I-LOC

in O

in O

It O

the O
horror O
in O

. O

I O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
last O
camp B-LOC
– O
in O
Minsk B-LOC
. O

The O
camp B-LOC
was O
located O
in O
Komarovska B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
Moscow B-LOC
highway O
. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
not O
fully O
built O
five O
- O
story O
house O
. O

More O
than O
5000 O
prisoners B-TER
of O
war B-TER
were O
kept O
there O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
– O
approximately O
1000 O
men B-TER
– O
, O
we O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
stable O
. O

We O
were O
fed O
with O
some O
soup B-TER
made O
of O
roasted B-TER
flour I-TER
. O

Bread B-TER
was O
not O
given O
to O
us O
. O

In O
order O
to O
warm O
up O
– O
it O
was O
October O
after O
all O
– O
we O
made O
campfires O
. O

One O
time O
, O
someone O
yelled O
food O
. O

Everyone O
ran O
outside O
without O
extinguishing O
the O
campfire O
and O
the O
stable O
caught O
fire O
. O

They O
assembled O
us O
. O

The O
commander O
counted O
off O
100 O
men B-TER
. O

They O
were O
immediately O
shot B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

Everyone O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
, O
because O
the O
inhabitants O
used O
to O
slip O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
to O
us O
. O

There O
were O
too O
many O
claimants O
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
sentries O
used O
to O
beat O
us O
with O
sticks O
of O
rubber O
and O
shot B-TER
at O
us O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
they O
used O
to O
kill B-TER
between O
30 O
and O
40 O
men B-TER
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
started O
to O
get O
sick B-TER
with I-TER
dysentery I-TER
. O

Whenever O
we O
went O
outside O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
shooting B-TER
. O

In O
the O
mornings O
, O
we O
used O
to O
find O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
murdered B-TER
. O

When O
they O
used O
to O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
, O
they O
used O
to O
kill B-TER
for O
any O
reason O
: O
if O
you O
said O
a O
word O
to O
a O
friend O
or O
if O
someone O
of O
the O

prisoners B-TER
halted O
for O
a O
minute O

From O
the O

station O
to O
Komarovska B-LOC
, O
one O
could O
see O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
murdered B-TER
prisoners B-TER
. O

One O
time O
, O
they O
brought O
prisoners B-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
Novgorod B-LOC
- I-LOC
Siverskyi I-LOC
. O

From O
2000 O

total O
only O
300 O
made O
it O
to O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
the O
rest O
died B-TER

. O

Many O
died B-TER
after O
arrival O
in O
Minsk B-LOC
. O

Two O
days O
in O
a O
row O
, O
we O
buried B-TER
them O
. O

Then O
, O
an O
epidemic B-TER
of I-TER
typhus I-TER
broke O
out O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
around O
200 O
prisoners B-TER
died B-TER
. O

All O
those O
who O
could O
still O
move O
a O
little O
, O
used O
to O
carry O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
out O
to O
the O
park O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
bury B-TER
them O
, O
though O
– O
the O
soil O
was O
frozen O
through O
and O
through O
. O

We O
piled O
them O
up O
. O

When O
spring O
was O
approaching O
, O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
started O
to O
decay O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
general O
commissar O
of O
Belarus B-LOC
commanded O
that O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
were O
to O
be O
doused O
with O
fuel O
and O
burned B-TER
. O

I O
survived O
by O
mere O
accident O
– O
I O
do O
n’t O
look O
like O
a O
Jew O
. O

The O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
were O
usually O
stripped O
naked O
, O
they O
usually O
got O
beaten O
, O
killed B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
, O
they O
would O
be O
thrown O
into O
a O
basement O
where O
water O
reached O
over O
their O
knees O
. O

After O
three O
days O
, O
they O
were O
dragged O
out O
of O
there O
and O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
many O
Jews O
remained O
– O
old O
people O
and O
women B-TER
with O
children B-TER
who O
had O
not O
managed O
to O
evacuate O
. O

There O
were O
also O
refugees B-TER
there O
from O
Western B-LOC
Ukraine I-LOC

They O
were O
put O
into O
the O
ghetto O
. O

10 O
thousand O
Jews O
from O
Hamburg B-LOC
were O
also O
brought O
there B-LOC

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC

there O
were O
people O
with O
different O
professions O
: O
professors O
, O
craftsmen O
, O
physicians B-TER
, O
workers O
, O
musicians B-TER
. O

The O
killings B-TER
followed O
special O
ceremonies O
. O

The O
condemned O
were O
made O
to O
dig O
their O
own O
graves O
. O

The O
musicians B-TER
had O
to O
play O
arias O
from O
Zshidovka O
and O
Kol O

. O

They O
went O
in O
columns O
. O

Old O
women B-TER
went O
, O
mothers B-TER
with O
their O
children B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
would O
start O
shooting O
with O
machine O
guns O
and O
automatic O
guns O
. O

Into O
the O
pits B-TER
, O
the O
murdered B-TER
used O
to O
fall O
as O
well O
as O
wounded O
ones O
, O
those O
barely O
alive O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
pits B-TER
were O
covered O
with O
soil O
. O

Such O
massacres B-TER
usually O
took O
place O
once O
per O
week O
, O
definitely O
around O
Shabes O
. O

The O
children B-TER
that O
stayed O
behind O
without O
parents B-TER
were O
gathered O
together O
in O
one O
go O
. O

There O
were O
more O
than O
200 O
such O
children B-TER
. O

They B-TER
used I-TER
to I-TER
take I-TER
them I-TER
by I-TER
their I-TER
feet I-TER
and I-TER
split I-TER
their I-TER
heads I-TER
in I-TER
two I-TER
against I-TER
a I-TER
stone I-TER
or I-TER
a I-TER
pole I-TER

The O
whole O
city B-LOC
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
anxiety O
, O
in O
the O
deep O
darkness O
of O
these O
unprecedented O
massacres B-TER
. O

Through O
the O
summer O
of O
1942 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
used O
to O
bring O
Jews O
from O
Western O
Europe O
to O
Minsk B-LOC

Ostensibly O
, O
they O
were O
brought O
there O

the O

They O
used O

the O
Germans B-TER
used B-TER
to I-TER
poison I-TER
them I-TER
with I-TER
gases I-TER
in O
order O
not O
to O
waste O
any O

In O
hermetically O

the O

which O
the O
dead B-TER

from O
the O
suffocated B-TER
were O
thrown O

We O

I O
spoke O

after O
the O
13th O
March O
1938 O
: O
At O
this O
time O
Nazis O
armed O
with O
revolvers O
and O
fixed O
bayonets O
often O
intruded O
into O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
and O
businesses B-TER
to O
loot B-TER
them O
. O

Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
were O
daubed B-TER
with O
white O
or O
black O
paint O
and O
next O
to O
drawings O
which O
were O
supposed O
to O
show O
Jews O
one O
could O
read O
the O
following O
inscription O
on O
every O
Jewish B-TER
business I-TER
: O
JUD O
oder O
SAUJUD O
[ O
Jew O
or O
Jewish O
Pig O
] O
, O
some O
time O
later O
: O
BIN O
SCHON O
IN O
DACHAU O
[ O
Already O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
] O
etc O
. O

Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
were O
placed O
under O
the O
management O
of O
Aryan B-TER
commissioners O
if O
they O
had O
not O
been O
arisiert O
[ O
Aryanised O
] O
straight O
away O
, O
which O
means O
they O
were O
robbed B-TER
by O
Nazis O
. O

Jewish B-TER
lawyers I-TER
were O
deprived B-TER
of O
the O
right O
to O
practise O
their O
profession O
. O

15,000 O
Jews O
were O
already O
out O
of O
work O
in O
April O
and O
being O
fed O
by O
the O
Israelitisch B-TER
Kultusgemeinde I-TER
[ O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
] O
. O

Men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
were O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
together O
at O
random O
on O
the O
streets O
or O
fetched O
from O
homes B-TER
by O
the O
brown[-shirted O
] O
hordes O
for O
Reiben O
[ O
washing O
] O
. O

They O
had O
to O
wash O
off O
the O
labels O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
, O
at O
which O
they O
were O
laughed B-TER
at I-TER
and O
mistreated B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
SA B-ORG
occupied O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
in O
order O
to O
listen O
to O
Hitler B-PER
's I-PER
speeches O
on O
the O
radio B-TER
. O

On O
the O
streets O
elderly O
Jews O
not O
infrequently O
were O
made B-TER
to O
perform O
military O
exercises O
or O
gymnastics O
. O

Imprisonments B-TER
begin O
: O
If O
a O
Jew O
attempted O
to O
leave O
for O
abroad O
he O
was O
arrested B-TER
, O
because O
he O
was O
presumed O
to O
be O
a O
Fluchtgefahr O
[ O
escape O
risk O
] O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
a O
Jew O
had O
not O
attempted O
to O
leave O
, O
then O
he O
wanted O
to O
remain O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
was O
arrested B-TER
anyway O
! O
Prominent O
Vienna B-LOC
Jews O
mostly O
came O
into O
Schutzhaft O
protective O
custody O
. O

Life O
became O
insufferable O
and O
scores O
of O
Viennese B-LOC
made O
an O
end B-TER
to I-TER
their I-TER
lives I-TER
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
their O
arrest B-TER
, O
though O
it O
often O
seemed O
that O
they O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
who O
had O
forced O
their O
way O
into O
their O
homes O
. O

Thousands O
of O
large O
lorries O
were O
driven O
by O
young O
Nazis O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
shouting O
Juda O
verrecke O
[ O
perish O
Judah O
] O
. O

Nowhere O
was O
safe O
for O
life O
as O
a O
Jew O
any O
more O
, O
since O
even O
a O
five B-TER
- I-TER
year I-TER
- I-TER
old I-TER
boy O
had O
a O
knife O
20 O
cm O
long O
, O
with O
which O
he O
threatened B-TER
Saujuden O
or O
was O
allowed O
to O
or O
should O
injure O
them O
. O

I O
myself O
attended O
a O
Realgymnasium O
[ O
secondary O
school B-TER
] O
where O
the O
majority O
of O
pupils B-TER
were O
Aryan B-TER
. O

After O
Hitler B-PER
invaded O
, O
the O
Aryan B-TER
pupils B-TER
Jewish B-TER
ones I-TER
so O
severely O
that O
the O
Nazi O
director O
of O
our O
establishment O
felt O
obliged O
to O
issue O
the O
following O
instruction O
: O
Aryanpupils O
in O
future O
will O
not O
be O
aggressive O
towards O
Jewish O
pupils O
in O
the O
school O
building O
, O
since O
the O
fate O
of O
these O
people O
is O
being O
determined O
outside O
the O
school O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
this O
directive O
naturally O
had O
not O
the O
slightest O
effect O
on O
the O
German O
- O
Aryan O
pupils B-TER
equipped O
with O
revolvers O
, O
knives O
, O
boots B-TER
, O
brown O
and O
white O
shirts B-TER
: O
they O
continued O
to O
come O
to O
lessons O
in O
the O
same O
garb O
and O
clearly O
showed O
that O
the O
Nazis O
were O
there O
now O
. O

After O
a O
while O
I O
had O
to O
attend O
a O
Jewish O
school O
, O
at O
which O
young O
, O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
professors O
were O
said O
to O
deliver O
lessons O
on O
all O
subjects O
. O

They O
did O
not O
do O
this O
, O
and O
contented O
themselves O
with O
coming O
to O
school O
in O
SS B-ORG
uniform B-TER
and O
threatening O
the O
poor O
Jewish B-TER
pupils I-TER
. O

Outside O
school B-TER
one O
did O
not O
have O
to O
Reiben O
[ O
wash O
] O
any O
more O
. O

Homes B-TER
were O
no O
longer O
occupied O
by O
Nazis O
who O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
radio B-TER
or O
loot B-TER
valuables O
; O
no O
one O
was O
raided O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
the O
home B-TER
, I-TER
and O
almost O
every O
Vienna B-LOC
Jew O
was O
arrested B-TER
and O
dispatched O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

The O
period O
of O
mass O
arrests B-TER
had O
begun O
... O
If O
someone O
rang O
at O
the O
door O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
, O
one O
did O
not O
open O
it O
for O
fear B-TER
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

One O
dreaded O
going O
to O
the O
telephone O
, O
and O
one O
dared O
not O
speak O
in O
one O
’s O
own O
home B-TER
, O
because O
a O
microphone O
could O
have O
been O
installed O
somewhere O
and O
a O
rash O
word O
meant O
arrest B-TER
. O

If O
two O
Jews O
walked O
together O
in O
the O
street O
then O
they O
were O
exposed O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
being O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
and O
if O
they O
did O
not O
give O
the O
identical O
answer O
to O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
question O
on O
what O
they O
had O
been O
speaking O
about O
, O
then O
they O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
immediately O
. O

During O
these O
months O
I O
spent O
more O
than O
one O
day O
unhappy O
, O
more O
than O
one O
night O
sleepless O
. O

In O
Vienna B-LOC
every O
Jew O
aged O
over O
18 O
years O
was O
threatened B-TER
with O
unfounded O
arrest B-TER
and O
the O
SPECTRE O
OF O
DACHAU B-LOC
! O
On O
some O
days O
, O
orders O
came O
from O
Herr O
[ B-PER
Josef I-PER
] I-PER
Bürckel I-PER
[ O
Gauleiter B-TER
of O
Vienna B-LOC
] O
, O
and O
then O
, O
for O
example O
, O
2,000 O
or O
another O
time O
again O
800 O
Jews O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

Neither O
my O
father O
nor O
my O
uncle O
avoided O
unfounded O
arrest B-TER
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
as O
I O
stood B-TER
in O
front O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
for O
endless O
days O
and O
nights O
crying O
and O
confused O
, O
so O
did O
many O
children B-TER
whose O
fathers O
, O
and O
many O
, O
many O
women B-TER
, O
whose O
husbands O
or O
sons O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
without O
reason O
. O

Mostly O
all O
attempts O
for O
release B-TER
were O
in O
vain O
, O
and O
after O
two O
days O
the O
transport B-TER
went O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

Jews O
were O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
in O
the O
streets O
, O
from O
homes B-TER
, O
from O
businesses B-TER
and O
coffeehouses O
, O
no O
longer O
for O
Reiben O
but O
for O
Freifahrt O
nach O
Dachau O
[ O
free O
travel O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
] O
, O
as O
the O
noble O
Nazis O
described O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
Jewish O
family B-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
who O
is O
not O
affected O
by O
this O
insufferable O
misfortune O
; O
at O
least O
one O
man B-TER
from O
every O
family B-TER
is O
in O
Schutzhaft B-TER
[ O
protective O
custody O
] O
and O
whilst O
he O
is O
being O
tortured B-TER
and O
martyred O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
or O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
his O
relatives B-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
are O
close O
to O
despair O
. O

People O
place O
such O
suffering O
upon O
people O
! O
Whilst O
I O
am O
writing O
this O
and O
no O
longer O
suffer O
, O
things O
are O
even O
worse O
for O
the O
poor O
Jews O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
than O
at O
the O
time O
when O
I O
was O
still O
there O
. O

Evidence O
should O
be O
the O
lines O
written O
to O
me O
by O
a O
lady B-TER
who O
has O
also O
escaped B-TER
that O
hell O
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
what O
was O
reported O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
who O
is O
already O
in O
a O
foreign O
country O
. O

The O
lady B-TER
in O
question O
writes O
: O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
to O
you O
what O
we O
have O
been O
part O
of O
, O
because O
a O
book O
would O
not O
suffice O
to O
record O
everything O
that O
we O
had O
to O
experience O
and O
suffer O
. O

I O
lived O
with O
my O
relative O
Dr. O
N. O
since O
1st O
November O
. O

On O
the O
Thursday O
in O
question O
there O
were O
house O
searches O
for O
every O
Jew O
, O
and O
then O
we O
were O
all O
locked O
up O
, O
even O
the O
child O
. O

The O
10 O
mark O
note O
that O
my O
cousin O
had O
lent O
me O
was O
taken O
from O
me O
though O
that O
was O
everything O
I O
possessed O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
sign O
that O
I O
had O
all O
my O
possessions O
. O

In O
Aachen O
I O
was O
stripped O
bare O
, O
and O
then O
a O
train O
was O
going O
to O
Brussels O
, O
and O
I O
took O
this O
train O
, O
to O
be O
able O
at O
last O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
hell O
. O

A O
friend O
reports O
: O
Firstly O
, O
I O
must O
apologise O
for O
my O
long O
silence O
. O

So O
much O
has O
happened O
since O
I O
last O
wrote O
to O
you O
that O
I O
could O
neither O
reply O
to O
any O
letters B-TER
nor O
pay O
any O
visits O
, O
because O
the O
events O
left O
me O
not O
a O
minute O
free O
. O

We O
, O
i.e. O
my O
family B-TER
, O
had O
to O
survive O
imprisonment B-TER
and O
a O
house O
search O
... O
After O
endless O
queuing O
and O
much O
running O
about O
we O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
obtaining O
a O
[ O
tax O
certificate O
] O
and O
thus O
we O
have O
fortunately O
arrived B-TER
in O
X O
... O
You O
can O
hardly O
imagine O
what O
has O
played O
out O
in O
Germany B-TER
since O
the O
assassination B-TER
of O
Ambassador B-TER
vom B-PER
Rath I-PER
. O

That O
we O
were O
not O
arrested B-TER
or O
looted B-TER
on O
that O
black O
Thursday O
is O
only O
attributable O
to O
the O
exemplary O
and O
honourable O
behaviour B-TER
of O
our O
Blockleiter O
[ O

. O

In O
total O
, O
roughly O
2,500 O
male O
youths B-TER
of O
our O
age O
( O
18 O
years O
! O
) O
were O
sent O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
... O
It O
is O
so O
dreadful O
that O
one O
can O
not O
write O
about O
what O
I O
alone O
have O
seen O
. O

One O
can O
not O
really O
celebrate O
one O

freedom O
when O
one O
thinks O
of O
the O
lot O
of O
those O
who O
are O
left O
behind O
in O

In O

I O
went O

for O

who O

Then O
I O
visited O
Herr O

for O
whom O
I O
had O
been O
given O
a O
message O

He O
was O
not O

inclined O
to O
discuss O
anything O

he O
presumed O
the O

would O
hear O
everything O
and O
that O
could O
have O
unpleasant O
consequences O
for O
him O
. O

Herr O
G. B-PER
brought O
me O
to O
the O
Aktion B-ORG
- I-ORG
Gildemeester I-ORG
[ O
Nazi O
- O
run O
operation O
to O
evacuate O
Jews O
from O
Vienna O
] O
office O
, O
where O
I O
spent O
some O
hours O
and O
was O
told O
the O
following O
: O
It O
is O
as O
difficult O
for O
the O
emigration B-TER
offices O
to O
get O
Jews O
over O
the O
German B-ORG
border O
as O
it O
is O
to O
get O
admission O
for O
them O
to O
another O
country O
. O

Each O
Jew O
means O
money O
for O
the O
German B-ORG
government I-ORG
, O
how O
they O
get O
it O
and O
by O
what O
means O
is O
immaterial O
to O
them O
. O

Even O
when O
all O
papers O
are O
in O
order O
, O
ticket O
paid O
, O
etc O
. O

the O
emigrants B-TER
are O
sent O
back O
from O
the O
station O
and O
[ O
they O
] O
try O
to O
get O
more O
money O
out O
of O
them O
. O

Furthermore O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Gildemeester B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
Herr O
Fasal B-PER
, O
had O
many O
complaints O
against O
the O
director O
of O
the O
Kultusgemeinde B-ORG
[ O
Jewish O
community O
] O
, O
Herr O
Löwenherz B-PER
, O
who O
according O
to O
him O
not O
only O
paid O
[ O
no O
] O
attention O
to O
the O
urgency O
of O
cases O
( O
in O
this O
case O
pure O
Jewish O
children B-TER
) O
but O
was O
very O
partial O
in O
his O
choice O
for O
the O
transports B-TER
e.g. O
Polish B-TER
Jews I-TER
and O
Zionists B-TER
enjoyed O
his O
favour O
. O

According O
to O
Herr O
Fasal B-PER
, O
that O
is O
also O
the O
reason O
for O
much O
disagreement O
between O
the O
Kultusgemeinde B-ORG
and O
the O
Gildemeester B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
and O
cooperation O
is O
particularly O
bad O
. O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
children B-TER
who O
are O
in O
entirely O
bad O
circumstances O
and O
who O
have O
obtained O
permission O
from O
the O
Netherl B-LOC
. O

government O
to O
reside O
in O
Holland B-LOC
still O
do O
not O
come O
with O
the O
transport B-TER
although O
others O
are O
arbitrarily O
chosen O
in O
their O
place O
. O

This O
is O
laid O
down O
by O
the O
Kultusgemeinde B-ORG
. O

The O
Nederl B-ORG
. I-ORG

Comité I-ORG
is O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
these O
children O
have O
already O
been O
sent O
away O
and O
will O
do O
no O
more O
about O
them O
. O

Not O
cases O
in O
the O
greatest O
need O
, O
therefore O
, O
but O
favouritism O
. O

One O
of O
the O
difficulties O
at O
the O
moment O
concerns O
the O
emigration B-TER
of O
boys B-TER
of O
16 O
and O
17 O
years O
, O
as O
they O
are O
in O
continual O
danger O
of O
being O
sent O
to O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
mainly O
if O
they O
are O
of O
large O
stature O
. O

One O
can O
guess O
what O
this O
indicates O
for O
these O
children B-TER
when O
one O
thinks O
that O
they O
undergo O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
adult O
men B-TER
. O

On O
Sunday O
afternoon O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Swedish B-ORG
Mission I-ORG
and O
there O
heard O
about O
the O
possibilities O
of O
emigration B-TER
to O
Sweden B-LOC
. O

These O
are O
also O
not O
great O
. O

There O
are O
already O
many O
children B-TER
from O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
there O
. O

7 O
January O
a O
transport B-TER
of O
100 O
Evangelical B-TER
children B-TER
left O
and O
during O
January O
the O
Kultusgemeinde B-ORG
organised O
a O
further O
transport B-ORG
of I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
children I-ORG
to O
Sweden B-LOC
. O

One O
hundred O
families B-TER
have O
gone O
to O
Ecuador B-LOC
, O
who O
can O
find O
a O
life O
there O
. O

Thereafter O
I O
was O
at O
the O
Gildemeester B-ORG
office O
for O
some O
time O
again O
, O
where O
I O
was O
told O
about O
a O
great O
plan O
for O
emigration B-TER
to O
Abyssinia B-LOC
. O

The O
costs O
of O
it O
are O
100,000 O
pounds O
and O
would O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
England B-LOC
. O

Given O
Mussolini B-PER
’s O
attitude O
to O
the O
Jews O
and O
the O
climate O
there O
, O
many O
think O
this O
is O
an O
impractical O
plan O
, O
anyway O
unsuited O
to O
providing O
emigrants B-TER
with O
a O
permanent O
place O
to O
stay O
. O

Monday O
morning O
I O
found O
Herr O
Lipopsky B-PER
and O
he O
told O
me O
the O
following O
about O
the O
Gildemeester B-ORG
office O
: O
This O
office O
has O
asked O
the O
committees B-TER
of O
all O
countries O
to O
become O
officially O
recognised O
as O
an O
emigration B-TER
office O
. O

None O
of O
these O
committees B-TER
has O
complied O
with O
this O
and O
therefore O
the O
G. B-ORG
office O
is O
trying O
to O
achieve O
independence O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
. O

Favouritism O
plays O
a O
large O
part O
here O
too O
. O

On O
the O
first O
transport B-ORG
to O
Holland B-LOC
e.g. O
all O
20 O
children B-TER
were O
allocated O
by O
the O
G. B-ORG
office O
, O
children B-TER
of O
its O
own O
staff O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
they O
arbitrarily O
take O
everyone O
who O
turns O
up O
, O
whilst O
it O
is O
emphatically O
stated O
that O
the O
K. B-ORG
G. I-ORG
[ O
Kultusgemeinde B-ORG
] O
looks O
after O
Jews O
, O
The B-ORG
Society I-ORG
of I-ORG
Friends I-ORG
after O
Evangelicals B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
this O
the O
work O
is O
very O
thwarted O
, O
the O
children B-TER
have O
to O
report O
to O
different O
offices O
, O
and O
these O
meanwhile O
do O
not O
know O
from O
each O
other O
if O
the O
children B-TER
have O
gone O
with O
a O
transport B-TER
or O
not O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
the O
G. B-ORG
office O
looks O
after O
for O
the O
K.G. B-ORG
and O
for O
the O
Soc B-ORG
. I-ORG

of I-ORG
Friends I-ORG
are O
the O
group O
permits O
with O
which O
the O
children B-TER
travel O
. O

The O
cooperation O
between O
the O
G. B-ORG
office O
and O
Herr O
L. B-PER
is O
thus O
limited O
too O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
talk O
of O
mutual O
working O
. O

In O
case O
of O
the O
greatest O
need O
they O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
each O
other O
. O

From O
Herr O
L. B-PER
I O
had O
the O
impression O
that O
Herr O
G. B-PER
himself O
is O
an O
entirely O
trustworthy O
person O
, O
but O
he O
is O
used O
as O
a O
tool O
by O
the O
staff O
of O
his O
office O
. O

Three O
weeks O
ago O
Herr O
G. B-PER
also O
went O
away O
as O
he O
had O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
at O
the O
office O
and O
he O
was O
recalled O
again O
because O
his O
name O
and O
possible O
contacts O
were O
of O
great O
importance O
to O
the O
office O
. O

Some O
things O
were O
confiscated B-TER
from O
the O
till O
, O
though O
it O
is O
hoped O
to O
get O
these O
back O
again O
on O
15 O
January O
; O
according O
to O
Herr O
L. B-PER
this O
is O
not O
likely O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
had O
also O
been O
at O
the O
house O
of O
The B-ORG
Society I-ORG
of I-ORG
Friends I-ORG
and O
looked O
through O
all O
the O
books O
, O
which O
seemed O
not O
to O
indicate O
much O
, O
however O
, O
and O
they O
were O
left O
alone O
. O

It O
sometimes O
appears O
that O
the O
children B-TER
who O
have O
transport B-ORG
opportunities O
and O
are O
on O
Herr O
L. B-PER
’s O
list O
can O
not O
be O
found O
any O
more O
. O

This O
happens O
because O
the O
families B-TER
are O
often O
suddenly O
displaced O
from O
their O
house O
and O
then O
no O
longer O
have O
another O
fixed O
address O
. O

This O
explains O
sending O
other O
children B-TER
than O
those O
who O
are O
given O
to O
Herr O
L. B-PER
by O
the O
Nederl B-ORG
. I-ORG

Comité I-ORG
. O

Then O
Herr O
L. B-PER
went O
with O
me O
to O
the O
Swedish B-ORG
Mission I-ORG
to O
take O
lists O
of O
Evang B-TER
. I-TER

children B-TER
who O
could O
possibly O
emigrate B-TER
. O

In O
the O
waiting O
room O
there O
I O
saw O
various O
cases O
of O
frozen O
limbs O
as O
a O
result O
of O
spells O
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
incl O
. O

one O
young O
man B-TER
whose O
hands O
remained O
thick O
and O
blue O
. O

He O
had O
already O
been O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
twice O
and O
was O
in O
danger O
of O
being O
arrested B-TER
all O
the O
time O
. O

Further O
variously O
crippled O
men O
( O
frozen O
feet O
) O
and O
one O
man B-TER
with O
a O
totally O
bandaged O
head O
( O
frozen O
ears O
) O
. O

Many O
cases O
occur O
particularly O
as O
the O
men B-TER
are O
sometimes O
made O
to O
exercise O
day O
and O
night O
scantily O
clothed O
in O
a O
cotton O
jacket O
and O
trousers O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
shoes O
and O
bald O
shaven O
uncovered O
head O
. O

Whoever O
puts O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets O
from O
the O
cold O
is O
struck O
with O
a O
club O
. O

Herr O
L. B-PER
told O
me O
afterwards O
that O
in O
a O
transport B-TER
to O
the O
camp B-TER
200 O
men B-TER
were O
loaded O
into O
a O
cattle B-TER
truck I-TER
and O
stood O
for O
5 O
days O
and O
nights O
without O
food B-TER
and I-TER
water I-TER
. O

Strong O
lights O
were O
brought O
onto O
the O
roof O
of O
this O
truck O
and O
the O
men B-TER
had O
to O
look O
into O
the O
light O
without O
a O
break O
. O

Whoever O
bent O
his O
head O
was O
beaten O
to O
attention O
again O
. O

The O
truck B-TER
was O
shot O
at O
if O
there O
was O
the O
slightest O
sound O
. O

The O
number O
reaching O
the O
camp B-TER
no O
longer O
alive O
is O
not O
small O
. O

On O
arrival O
there O
they O
have O
to O
exercise O
for O
hours O
. O

If O
they O
complain O
of O
thirst O
, O
coffee O
is O
thrown O
on O
the O
stone O
floor O
which O
they O
can O
lick O
up O
. O

In O
the O
race B-TER
crimes I-TER
section O
each O
man B-TER
gets O
5 O
kicks O
in O
the O
belly O
with O
a O
spiked O
shoe O
for O
each O
crime O
committed O
, O
many O
die O
here O
too O
. O

Another O
torture B-TER
is O
to O
tie O
round O
the O
men O
’s O
legs O
with O
a O
rope O
and O
in O
the O
room O
hoist O
them O
up O
to O
the O
ceiling O
with O
heads O
down O
, O
then O
the O
guards B-TER
undo O
the O
rope O
. O

Many O
are O
smashed O
to O
pieces O
on O
the O
stone O
floor O
. O

This O
is O
a O
bloodbath O
each O
time O
. O

Men B-TER
are O
laid O
on O
the O
floor O
in O
rows O
, O
they O
have O
to O
open O
their O
mouths O
wide O
and O
they O
urinate O
into O
their O
mouths O
. O

There O
are O
many O
indescribable O
variants O
of O
this O
policy O
. O

As O
regards O
small O
things O
there O
is O
punishment O
of O
20 O
lashes O
with O
a O
spiked O
stick O
, O
not O
administered O
by O
a O
single O
guard B-TER
but O
by O
20 O
different O
ones O
, O
so O
that O
each O
stroke O
is O
administered O
by O
a O
tireless O
arm O
. O

Each O
prisoner B-TER
must O
sign O
a O
paper O
where O
only O
one O
small O
square O
is O
left O
blank O
for O
the O
signature O
; O
the O
rest O
is O
covered O
up O
so O
that O
no O
one O
knows O
what O
he O
is O
signing O
. O

They O
must O
also O
sign O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
which O
says O
that O
they O
were O
never O
mistreated O
, O
had O
always O
eaten B-TER
and I-TER
drunk I-TER
well O
, O
and O
they O
were O
forbidden O
to O
speak O
about O
their O
treatment O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
on O
pain O
of O
death B-TER
. O

Machine O
guns O
are O
mounted O
at O
the O
four O
corners O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
; O
anyone O
who O
goes O
outside O
after O
sunset O
is O
shot O
down O
without O
further O
ado O
. O

Prisoners B-TER
may O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
for O
an O
hour O
a O
day O
; O
whoever O
says O
a O
word O
outside O
that O
time O
receives O
a O
number O
of O
blows O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
drinking B-TER
water I-TER
is O
inadequate O
and O
polluted O
. O

There O
is O
also O
no O
heating O
, O
while O
the O
shelter O
is O
totally O
inadequate O
. O

There O
are O
men O
returned O
from O
Dachau B-LOC
who O
lost O
30 O
pounds O
in O
one O
week O
. O

Fatalities O
are O
reported O
to O
the O
family B-TER
so O
they O
can O
come O
and O
fetch O
the O
urn O
; O
the O
body O
itself O
is O
never O
returned O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
for O
women B-TER
guarded B-TER
by O
men O
. O

One O
can O
imagine O
what O
this O
indicates O
. O

It O
seems O
not O
to O
be O
rare O
for O
Jewish O
girls O
of O
12 O
- O
14 O
years O
to O
be O
assaulted O
by O
SS B-ORG
or O
SA B-ORG
men O
. O

The O
emigration B-TER
chances O
of O
these O
children B-TER
are O
naturally O
extremely O
small O
, O
because O
one O
must O
wait O
for O
the O
results O
of O
this O
outrage O
. O

A O
few O
cases O
have O
nevertheless O
been O
transported O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

All O
these O
stories O
were O
told O
to O
me O
by O
Herr O
Lipopsky B-PER
, O
himself O
a O
full O
- O
blooded O
Aryan O
. O

The O
general O
misery O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
is O
unbelievable O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
have O
not O
had O
a O
roof O
over O
their O
heads O
for O
weeks O
, O
walking O
from O
doorway O
to O
doorway O
, O
who O
dare O
not O
report O
for O
emigration B-TER
from O
fear O
of O
being O
arrested B-TER
. O

Others O
, O
who O
no O
longer O
possess O
a O
cent O
, O
can O
get O
food B-TER
at O
the O
K.G. B-ORG
to O
the O
value O
of O
15 O
Pf O
. O

[ O
Pfennig O
; O
pennies O
] O
per O
day O
. O

From O
a O
statistic O
of O
one O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemeteries I-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
it O
appears O
that O
in O
the O
first O
weeks O
after O
10 O
November O
130 O
dead O
per O
day O
had O
to O
be O
buried B-TER
. O

Many O
cemeteries B-TER
were O
set O
on O
fire O
and O
the O
bodies O
lay O
open O
above O
the O
ground O
until O
the O
Jews O
themselves O
covered O
them O
with O
straw O
. O

The O
number O
of O
Jews O
killed B-TER
on O
10 O
November O
and O
later O
can O
not O
be O
counted O
; O
they O
talk O
of O
hundreds O
. O

The O
Nederl B-LOC
. I-LOC

[ O
Dutch O
] O
government O
has O
provided O
green O
cards O
for O
adult O
Jews O
, O
with O
which O
they O
are O
permitted O
to O
cross O
over O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
border O
with O
a O
valid O
passport B-TER
. O

These O
cards O
are O
valid O
only O
three O
weeks O
. O

For O
those O
coming O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
sometimes O
4 O
to O
5 O
days O
go O
by O
. O

As O
application O
for O
a O
pass B-TER
without O
the O
possibility O
of O
emigration B-TER
is O
pointless O
, O
and O
the O
minimum O
time O
required O
is O
three O
weeks O
, O
the O
cards O
expire O
before O
a O
pass B-TER
is O
obtained O
. O

Nor O
can O
these O
cards O
be O
extended O
. O

In O
these O
ways O
emigration B-TER
is O
made O
harder O
because O
a O
new O
application O
does O
not O
succeed O
. O

The O
cards O
should O
be O
valid O
for O
at O
least O
six O
weeks O
, O
as O
there O
is O
sometimes O
a O
delay O
through O
unpaid O
tax O
or O
fine O
. O

In O
relation O
to O
the O
various O
offices O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
one O
has O
the O
strong O
feeling O
that O
Austria B-LOC
is O
treated O
harshly O
by O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
, O
as O
the O
number O
of O
Austrian B-LOC
children B-TER
in O
relation O
to O
the O
total O
number O
of O
emigrated B-TER
children B-TER
is O
particularly O
small O
, O
while O
the O
need O
in O
Austria B-LOC
is O
certainly O
no O
less O
. O

The O
motto O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Vienna B-LOC
is O
: O
Die O
Juden O
sollen O
nicht O
verreisen O
, O
sondern O
verrecken O
. O

My O
Dears O
By O
now O
you O
will O
have O
received O
the O
airmail O
letters B-TER
we O
sent O
from O
here O
, O
from O
which O
you O
will O
have O
gathered O
that O
we O
have O
now O
arrived O
safely O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
the O
letter B-TER
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
write O
to O
you O
from O
the O
ship B-TER
, O
but O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
on O
account O
of O
a O
rather O
stormy O
crossing O
. O

I O
will O
now O
finally O
do O
what O
I O
had O
intended O
and O
describe O
to O
you O
what O
happened O
to O
us O
following O
the O
crisis O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

Of O
course O
I O
can O
only O
do O
this O
in O
the O
most O
general O
terms O
otherwise O
I O
would O
have O
to O
write O
a O
whole O
novel O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
moved O
to O
X. O
on O
10th O
October O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
that O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Z. O
any O
longer O
under O
any O
circumstances O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
mobilisation O
was O
announced O
the O
rumour O
spread O
in O
Z. O
that O
if O
war O
broke O
out O
the O
Jews O
would O
all O
have O
their O
throats O
slit O
because O
they O
were O
responsible O
for O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

This O
was O
passed O
on O
to O
a O
number O
of O
acquaintances O
by O
trustworthy O
people O
, O
and O
some O
acquaintances O
had O
already O
left O
Z. O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

We O
did O
not O
do O
so O
, O
however O
, O
although O
we O
did O
listen O
to O
the O
radio B-TER
day O
and O
night O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

Initially O
I O
took O
the O
whole O
thing O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
gossip O
and O
assumed O
that O
everything O
had O
turned O
out O
for O
the O
best O
because O
war O
did O
not O
actually O
break O
out O
. O

However O
I O
decided O
from O
that O
point O
to O
live O
only O
in O
furnished O
accommodation B-TER
, O
because O
you O
are O
more O
mobile O
if O
something O
happens O
. O

So O
we O
put O
our O
furniture O
into O
storage O
with O
a O
removal O
company O
and O
rented O
two O
furnished O
rooms B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
X. O
chasing O
up O
the O
authorities B-TER
to O
make O
sure O
that O
our O
preparations O
for O
emigration B-TER
were O
progressing O
. O

However O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
now O
much O
more O
difficult O
and O
protracted O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
because O
you O
have O
to O
sort O
things O
out O
with O
many O
more O
offices B-TER
than O
before O
. O

We O
had O
reserved O
a O
place O
on O
a O
ship B-TER
for O
the O
28th O
December O
and O
wanted O
to O
travel O
together O
with O
A. O
However O
we O
changed O
this O
in O
the O
light O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

Before O
describing O
the O
events O
of O
10th O
November O
( O
exactly O
four O
weeks O
after O
our O
move O
to O
X. O
) O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
that O
there O
was O
a O
simple O
but O
particularly O
moving O
celebration O
of O
Chanukah O
on O
board O
the O
ship B-TER
. O

A O
gentleman O
who O
had O
already O
been O
living O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
for O
five O
years O
, O
and O
had O
apparently O
once O
been O
a O
newspaper B-TER
editor I-TER
, O
gave O
a O
speech O
, O
the O
motto O
of O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
adopt O
as O
the O
title O
for O
my O
descriptions O
, O
in O
particular O
because O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
... O
and O
you O
too O
, O
my O
dear O
... O
have O
written O
to O
say O
that O
we O
should O
forget O
what O
happened O
. O

Certainly O
one O
has O
to O
look O
to O
the O
future O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
leave O
it O
up O
to O
your O
discretion O
to O
decide O
, O
once O
you O
have O
read O
what O
follows O
, O
whether O
it O
is O
perhaps O
right O
not O
to O
forget O
the O
things O
that O
have O
occurred O
, O
but O
instead O
make O
sure O
that O
our O
children B-TER
know O
about O
them O
one O
day O
too O
. O

The O
motto O
of O
the O
gentleman O
’s O
speech O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
Children O
of O
Israel O
, O
do O
not O
forget O
what O
Amalek O
did O
to O
you O
. O

Previously O
we O
had O
only O
known O
from O
school B-TER
what O
it O
was O
like O
to O
experience O
a O
pogrom B-TER
in O
which O
the O
Tempel B-TER
[ B-TER
synagogues B-TER
] O
are O
destroyed O
, O
now O
we O
know O
for O
ourselves O
. O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
10th O
November O
I O
drove O
into O
town O
to O
visit O
the O
removal O
company O
in O
order O
to O
sort O
out O
various O
things O
relating O
to O
the O
containers O
. O

I O
passed O
a O
Jewish O
jewellers O
and O
its O
blinds O
were O
down O
and O
there O
was O
broken B-TER
glass I-TER
on O
the O
street O
. O

I O
thought O
to O
myself O
that O
there O
must O
have O
been O
a O
burglary O
because O
we O
had O
not O
heard O
anything O
at O
home B-TER
about O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

En O
route O
to O
the O
removal O
company O
I O
then O
saw O
that O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
Jewish O
shops O
had O
been O
smashed B-TER
in O
and O
that O
some O
of O
the O
merchandise O
had O
been O
thrown B-TER
out I-TER
onto O
the O
street O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
encountered O
gangs O
of O
around O
15 O
to O
20 O
men B-TER
armed O
with O
axes O
and O
pickaxes O
who O
were O
in O
the O
process O
of O
smashing B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
removal O
company O
the O
glass O
rained O
down O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
Klauß O
( O
orthodox O
synagogue B-TER
) O
right O
next O
door O
to O
the O
office O
. O

Inside O
much O
had O
already O
been O
destroyed B-TER
and O
lots O
of O
curious O
people O
were O
looking O
through O
the O
door O
, O
which O
had O
been O
smashed B-TER
with O
an O
axe O
. O

So O
these O
were O
the O
first O
things O
I O
experienced O
that O
morning O
on O
my O
journey O
into O
town O
. O

Initially O
everyone O
thought O
that O
the O
synagogues B-TER
and O
shops O
would O
be O
destroyed B-TER
and O
that O
that O
would O
then O
be O
the O
end O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
result O
I O
wanted O
to O
pay O
the O
removal O
company O
and O
buy O
our O
tickets O
for O
the O
ship B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
so O
that O
we O
could O
leave B-TER
suddenly O
if O
necessary O
. O

I O
telephoned O
... O
in O
Amsterdam B-LOC
because O
we O
had O
heard O
that O
it O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
get O
permission B-TER
to O
gain O
entry O
there O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
changed O
the O
booking O
to O
the O
Holland B-LOC
Line O
, O
because O
that O
would O
mean O
going O
to O
Rotterdam B-LOC
to O
board O
the O
ship B-TER
. O

If O
we O
used O
the O
American O
Line O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
would O
tell O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
board O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

Jewish O
bank B-TER
accounts I-TER
were O
being O
kept O
under O
particularly O
strict O
surveillance O
by O
this O
point O
. O

Gaining O
access O
to O
our O
money O
in O
Z. O
was O
only O
possible O
after O
a O
number O
of O
telephone O
calls O
and O
after O
I O
had O
also O
got O
the O
removal O
company O
to O
make O
a O
call O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
payment O
for O
the O
container O
had O
to O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
Gestapo O
and O
the O
Kreisleitung O
[ O
Nazi O
municipal O
authorities O
] O
. O

At O
the O
banks B-TER
you O
also O
could O
not O
have O
unlimited O
access O
to O
your O
money O
and O
often O
had O
to O
collect O
a O
series O
of O
small O
amounts O
. O

A O
decree O
was O
also O
issued O
by O
the O
Bankenvereinigung O
[ O
banking O
association O
] O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
to O
the O
effect O
that O
to O
prevent O
a O
sharp O
fall O
in O
prices O
Jews O
could O
not O
sell O
their O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
. O

One O
could O
only O
sell O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
of O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
if O
the O
account B-TER
was O
not O
in O
credit O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
spent O
the O
credit O
in O
my O
account B-TER
so O
that O
I O
could O
sell O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
worth O
of O
securities O
. O

One O
had O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
wade O
through O
all O
these O
things O
because O
it O
was O
often O
the O
case O
that O
by O
midday O
instructions O
that O
had O
been O
in O
place O
in O
the O
morning O
had O
suddenly O
changed O
. O

From O
the O
removal O
company O
I O
went O
home B-TER
and O
reported O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
then O
went O
to O
get O
food B-TER
for O
the O
people O
in O
our O
house B-TER
because O
we O
could O
no O
longer O
eat B-TER
at O
the O
Jewish O
restaurant B-TER
following O
its O
wrecking B-TER
. O

En O
route O
I O
visited O
a O
good O
friend O
as O
he O
had O
telephoned O
Mutter O
[ O
Mother O
] O
to O
say O
that O
I O
should O
not O
go O
into O
the O
city O
. O

Whilst O
I O
was O
there O
a O
man O
joined O
us O
and O
reported O
that O
the O
gangs O
were O
now O
going O
around O
private O
homes B-TER
smashing B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
and O
that O
the O
men B-TER
were O
going O
to O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

Immediately O
I O
then O
returned O
home B-TER
to O
Mutter O
and O
prepared O
her O
and O
the O
other O
people O
in O
the O
house B-TER
for O
a O
possible O
visit O
from O
these O
people O
. O

As O
I O
stood O
guard O
behind O
the O
curtains O
one O
of O
these O
gangs O
did O
indeed O
come O
down O
our O
street O
, O
however O
passed O
us O
by O
and O
turned O
round O
the O
corner O
. O

We O
then O
saw O
books B-TER
, O
cushions O
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
household O
goods O
etc O
. O

flying O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
onto O
the O
street O
three O
houses B-TER
down O
from O
our O
home B-TER
. O

It O
was O
essential O
to O
act O
in O
these O
minutes O
. O

Mutter O
kept O
saying O
I O
should O
not O
stay O
at O
home B-TER
. O

I O
therefore O
spent O
some O
time O
driving O
here O
and O
there O
around O
X. O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
destruction B-TER
was O
fully O
underway O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

I O
parked O
the O
car O
next O
to O
others O
on O
the O
roadside O
because O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
safe O
in O
the O
car O
any O
longer O
. O

Now O
walking O
around O
on O
foot O
with O
my O
briefcase O
containing O
the O
passports B-TER
and O
the O
visas B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
to O
show O
utmost O
self O
- O
control O
and O
not O
run O
away O
if O
I O
came O
across O
one O
of O
these O
gangs O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
for O
it O
however O
but O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
onlookers O
and O
then O
disappear O
into O
thin O
air O
. O

Although O
I O
stayed O
close O
to O
home B-TER
I O
did O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
knowing O
that O
Mama O
was O
alone O
there O
with O
the O
old O
people O
. O

I O
telephoned O
Mama O
and O
we O
met O
in O
town O
as O
it O
had O
all O
pretty O
much O
come O
to O
an O
end O
there O
and O
the O
gangs O
were O
all O
now O
in O
the O
residential O
areas O
. O

Mama O
came O
over O
immediately O
with O
a O
sausage B-TER
and O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
everyone O
for O
lunch B-TER
. O

We O
drove O
past O
the O
furniture O
store O
and O
saw O
that O
nothing O
had O
happened O
there O
. O

( O
I O
later O
heard O
that O
that O
they O
had O
wanted O
to O
destroy O
everything O
there O
too O
, O
but O
the O
Aryan B-TER
removal O
man O
had O
been O
able O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

) O
We O
then O
decided O
to O
travel O
to O
Z. O
because O
we O
could O
not O
tell O
whether O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
X. O
was O
merely O
the O
result O
of O
local O
decision O
making O
. O

In O
any O
case O
Mutter O
had O
a O
doctor B-TER
's O
appointment O
in O
Z. O
that O
day O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
change O
the O
bandage B-TER
on O
her O
injured O
hand O
. O

We O
telephoned O
Z. O
and O
discovered O
that O
B. O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
were O
intending O
to O
arrest B-TER
all O
the O
men B-TER
, O
because O
his O
deputy O
was O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

We O
ate O
the O
food B-TER
that O
Mama O
had O
brought O
along O
in O
the O
car O
en O
route O
. O

In O
Z. O
I O
rang O
acquaintances O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
men B-TER
had O
been O
taken O
away O
there O
as O
well O
, O
and O
that O
the O
same O
thing O
had O
happened O
to O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

We O
decided O
to O
travel O
to O
Y. O
next O
and O
then O
possibly O
from O
there O
visit O
the O
doctor B-TER
in O
X. O
In O
Y. O
we O
were O
told O
by O
... O
that O
all O
of O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
city O
by O
evening O
. O

... O
had O
not O
been O
taken O
and O
while O
we O
were O
there O
a O
Schupo O
[ O
uniformed B-TER
policeman B-TER
] O
turned O
up O
to O
demand O
a O
signature O
confirming O
that O
he O
would O
leave O
the O
city O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
then O
drove O
to O
Onkel O
[ O
uncle O
] O
C. O
who O
was O
packing O
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
went O
over O
to O
... O
. O

( O
In O
the O
meantime O
he O
has O
made O
it O
to O
Detroit B-LOC
with O
Tante O
[ O
aunt O
] O
. O

) O
We O
took O
C. O
and O
D. O
with O
us O
to O
X. O
to O
join O
their O
acquaintances O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
when O
we O
arrived O
in O
X. O
we O
telephoned O
our O
landlord O
and O
were O
told O
that O
nothing O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
there O
. O

So O
the O
day O
was O
finally O
over O
and O
we O
returned O
home B-TER
. O

One O
heard O
that O
everything O
had O
died O
down O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
yet O
one O
was O
not O
confident O
that O
someone O
would O
not O
still O
turn O
up O
and O
collect O
those O
who O
had O
been O
forgotten O
. O

Occasionally O
one O
could O
not O
sleep O
, O
one O
could O
not O
eat O
on O
account O
of O
the O
agitation O
, O
or O
one O
slept O
soundly O
and O
could O
also O
eat O
due O
to O
the O
agitation O
. O

Now O
one O
really O
could O
see O
misery O
everywhere O
. O

People O
kept O
arriving O
in O
X. O
from O
... O
and O
other O
towns O
because O
the O
Jews O
had O
been O
expelled O
from O
the O
... O
Gau O
. O

The O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
in O
... O
was O
burned O
out O
so O
the O
old O
people O
moved O
to O
the O
Jewish O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
and O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
... O
. O

Mattresses O
, O
bed O
linen O
etc O
. O

were O
quickly O
collected O
and O
the O
home B-TER
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
affected O
, O
was O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
refugee B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
so O
overcrowded O
that O
the O
mattresses O
had O
to O
be O
laid O
out O
on O
the O
floor O
for O
the O
refugees B-TER
. O

Anyone O
who O
had O
acquaintances O
elsewhere O
tried O
to O
reach O
them O
in O
order O
to O
have O
somewhere O
to O
sleep O
and O
food B-TER
to O
eat B-TER
. O

People O
kept O
turning O
up O
at O
our O
place O
too O
until O
they O
could O
finally O
get O
to O
their O
acquaintances O
. O

The O
people O
arrived O
with O
a O
small O
suitcase O
or O
a O
bundle O
- O
just O
as O
in O
the O
pictures O
one O
has O
seen O
of O
refugees B-TER
in O
wartime B-TER
. O

It O
will O
doubtless O
interest O
you O
to O
know O
about O
what O
happened O
in O
... O
and O
we O
got O
to O
hear O
quite O
a O
bit O
because O
people O
were O
arriving O
all O
the O
time O
. O

It O
was O
bad O
because O
many O
people O
did O
not O
know O
where O
their O
relatives O
or O
acquaintances O
had O
ended O
up O
. O

Everything O
happened O
in O
such O
a O
rush O
that O
initially O
everyone O
had O
to O
see O
to O
their O
own O
affairs O
and O
then O
one O
would O
meet O
someone O
by O
chance O
who O
would O
be O
able O
to O
say O
where O
the O
others O
were O
. O

We O
heard O
the O
following O
about O
... O
from O
acquaintances O
who O
came O
from O
... O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
the O
synagogue B-TER
was O
already O
in O
flames B-TER
petrol O
had O
been O
poured O
during O
the O
night O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

Once O
it O
had O
burned B-TER
out I-TER
the O
synagogue B-TER
was O
blown O
up O
and O
is O
now O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
pile O
of O
stones O
surrounded O
by O
a O
wooden O
fence O
. O

Nothing O
happened O
to O
the O
cemetery B-TER
, O
and O
we O
visited O
Papa O
's O
grave B-TER
and O
that O
of O
our O
grandparents O
on O
the O
Sunday O
before O
we O
left O
. O

Papa O
died B-TER
six O
years O
ago O
on O
6th O
December O
and O
this O
time O
I O
could O
not O
go O
to O
a O
synagogue B-TER
to O
say O
Kaddish O
because O
they O
had O
all O
been O
destroyed B-TER
. O

On O
7th O
December O
we O
set O
off O
at O
2 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
for O
Amsterdam B-LOC
in O
... O
because O
I O
had O
a O
meeting O
at O
midday O
with O
... O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Germany B-LOC
any O
longer O
thereafter O
. O

In O
... O
everyone O
was O
expelled O
and O
had O
to O
leave O
... O
at O
midday O
. O

But O
before O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
train B-TER
there O
was O
an O
inspection O
at O
the O
platform O
barrier O
of O
the O
men B-TER
by O
the O
SS B-ORG
and O
of O
the O
women B-TER
by O
the O
Frauenschaft O
[ O
National O
Socialist O
Women O
’s O
League O
] O
. O

The O
Jews O
had O
their O
jewellery O
and O
money O
confiscated B-TER
, O
apart O
from O
some O
small O
change O
, O
so O
that O
they O
were O
virtually O
penniless O
when O
they O
arrived O
. O

The O
people O
were O
happy O
to O
have O
got O
away O
with O
their O
lives O
, O
the O
pictures O
were O
terrible O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
and O
the O
women B-TER
arrived O
in O
this O
state O
with O
their O
children B-TER
. O

And O
initially O
no O
one O
knew O
where O
the O
men B-TER
had O
been O
taken O
and O
what O
they O
would O
do O
to O
them O
. O

In O
... O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
were O
put O
in O
prison B-TER
and O
others O
taken O
to O
the O
Jewish O
café O
. O

Initially O
they O
lay O
on O
straw O
in O
the O
café O
and O
apparently O
they O
were O
not O
treated O
very O
nicely O
there O
either O
. O

From O
there O
the O
men B-TER
were O
sent O
to O
... O
and O
then O
transported B-TER
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

Three O
men B-TER
, O
including O
... O
, O
had O
their O
visas B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
were O
therefore O
released B-TER
in O
... O
. O

Initially O
no O
one O
dared O
go O
back O
to O
.... O
However O
one O
day O
the O
refugees B-TER
in O
... O
were O
suddenly O
expelled O
again O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
were O
supposed O
to O
return O
to O
where O
they O
had O
been O
living O
previously O
. O

People O
therefore O
really O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
should O
do O
because O
every O
town O
had O
its O
own O
arrangements O
- O
there O
were O
no O
longer O
any O
real O
laws B-TER
to O
speak O
of O
. O

In O
... O
it O
was O
particularly O
good O
because O
the O
Kreisleiter O
[ O
Nazi O
municipal O
leader O
] O
there O
was O
something O
of O
a O
hero O
when O
it O
came O
to O
these O
things O
. O

Almost O
all O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
were O
more O
or O
less O
wrecked B-TER
and O
more O
than O
a O
little O
had O
been O
stolen O
. O

First O
the O
women B-TER
were O
allowed O
back O
into O
the O
wrecked B-TER
homes B-TER
and O
had O
no O
idea O
where O
to O
begin O
clearing O
up O
. O

The O
homes B-TER
had O
been O
sealed O
by O
the O
police B-TER
and O
one O
first O
had O
to O
go O
there O
to O
get O
the O
key O
to O
gain O
access O
. O

Mama O
was O
with O
... O
who O
often O
used O
to O
visit O
us O
and O
who O
lived O
with O
... O
at O
her O
mother O
in O
law O
's O
in O
... O
She O
also O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
... O
in O
order O
to O
get O
into O
the O
flat B-TER
. O

They O
had O
forgotten O
to O
wreck B-TER
this O
flat B-TER
, O
which O
was O
also O
a O
stroke O
of O
luck O
for O
us O
because O
we O
had O
left O
our O
clock O
etc O
. O

there O
as O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
taken O
them O
to O
... O
because O
when O
Mama O
was O
in O
hospital B-TER
, O
initially O
I O
stayed O
with O
... O
in O
... O
. O

In O
... O
I O
ended O
up O
running O
a O
law B-TER
office O
pure O
and O
simple O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
women B-TER
discovered O
that O
I O
had O
not O
been O
taken O
away O
. O

Alongside O
my O
own O
affairs O
I O
had O
endless O
petitions O
to O
write O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
on O
behalf O
of O
acquaintances O
concerning O
the O
release B-TER
of O
the O
men B-TER
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
the O
men B-TER
were O
released B-TER
once O
they O
had O
received O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
also O
heard O
that O
... O
had O
been O
released B-TER
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
is O
true O
but O
it O
may O
be O
the O
case O
because O
he O
had O
pushed O
ahead O
with O
his O
plan O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
USA B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
wrecking B-TER
old O
Herr O
X. O
, O
who O
suffered O
from O
a O
heart B-TER
condition I-TER
, O
had O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
. O

No O
one O
knows O
who O
buried B-TER
him O
because O
there O
were O
no O
men B-TER
left O
in O
... O
. O

A O
certain O
Herr O
Z. O
in O
... O
also O
died B-TER
of O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
Y. O
died B-TER
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

P. O
was O
apparently O
auf O
der O
Flucht O
erschossen O
[ O
shot B-TER
whilst O
escaping B-TER
] O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
everything O
that O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
of O
course O
in O
all O
the O
excitement O
all O
kinds O
of O
rumours O
did O
the O
rounds O
which O
later O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
false O
. O

I O
myself O
could O
not O
return O
to O
... O
until O
the O
Sunday O
before O
our O
departure O
. O

Acquaintances O
and O
someone O
from O
the O
Kreisleitung O
with O
whom O
I O
had O
a O
telephone O
conversation O
advised O
me O
not O
to O
go O
to O
... O
. O

In O
our O
house B-TER
the O
whole O
of O
the O
first O
floor O
has O
been O
let O
to O
an O
army O
officer O
. O

On O
the O
second O
floor O
the O
large O
pane O
of O
glass O
in O
the O
corridor O
was O
smashed O
and O
the O
fine O
gentlemen O
moved O
on O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
our O
flat B-TER
was O
empty O
. O

Apparently O
they O
had O
also O
wrecked B-TER
the O
furniture O
on O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

Frau O
... O
had O
gone O
to O
her O
relatives O
. O

The O
flat B-TER
is O
let O
to O
a O
Feldwebel O
[ O
sergeant O
] O
and O
Frau O
... O
intended O
to O
give O
up O
the O
flat B-TER
once O
we O
had O
moved O
to O
... O
. O

On O
the O
Sunday O
after O
going O
to O
the O
cemetery B-TER
we O
went O
to O
visit O
... O
who O
was O
there O
that O
day O
. O

... O
is O
also O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
and O
... O
is O
with O
... O
staying O
with O
her O
[ O
their O
] O
parents O
. O

Her O
father O
was O
also O
picked O
up O
but O
released B-TER
again O
, O
and O
the O
brother O
picked O
up O
. O

It O
is O
barely O
possible O
to O
describe O
how O
... O
's O
flat B-TER
looked O
. O

The O
heavy O
furniture O
had O
been O
hacked O
up O
into O
firewood O
, O
the O
pictures O
slashed O
, O
all O
the O
crockery O
and O
mirrors O
smashed O
into O
a O
thousand O
pieces O
. O

This O
chaos O
was O
strewn O
around O
all O
the O
rooms O
. O

Only O
old O
and O
dirty O
linen O
remained O
, O
and O
the O
same O
with O
the O
suits O
. O

Silver O
and O
new O
things O
were O
all O
missing O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
imagine O
how O
it O
looked O
, O
and O
even O
with O
my O
descriptions O
you O
can O
not O
imagine O
how O
the O
wrecked B-TER
homes B-TER
looked O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
trying O
to O
describe O
it O
in O
any O
more O
detail O
because O
one O
would O
not O
know O
where O
to O
end O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
... O
's O
and O
there O
also O
much O
was O
wrecked B-TER
. O

... O
went O
with O
his O
family O
to O
... O
to O
stay O
with O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
also O
lodged O
with O
us O
. O

By O
now O
he O
will O
be O
on O
his O
way O
here O
and O
initially O
intended O
to O
go O
to O
Luxembourg B-LOC
until O
the O
steamer O
was O
due O
to O
depart O
, O
where O
... O
has O
emigrated B-TER
to O
. O

Onkel O
... O
also O
stayed O
with O
us O
and O
his O
place O
had O
also O
been O
completely O
wrecked B-TER
. O

He O
also O
wants O
to O
come O
here O
but O
is O
a O
long O
way O
down O
the O
registration B-TER
list O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

Elsbeth O
and O
her O
acquaintances O
have O
stood O
surety O
for O
him O
. O

We O
were O
in O
... O
for O
one O
night O
because O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
time O
during O
the O
day O
, O
and O
was O
out O
and O
about O
sorting O
out O
our O
emigration B-TER
every O
day O
. O

They O
had O
not O
wrecked B-TER
any O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
there O
and O
Kurt O
was O
not O
picked O
up O
. O

Tante O
Frieda O
is O
due O
to O
go O
to O
Sweden B-LOC
soon O
to O
stay O
with O
... O
. O

... O
has O
stood O
surety O
for O
... O
. O

... O
and O
... O
have O
not O
had O
any O
luck O
getting O
surety O
yet O
, O
but O
we O
hope O
to O
sort O
this O
out O
as O
well O
because O
they O
have O
a O
low O
number O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

We O
hope O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
them O
out O
soon O
. O

On O
the O
street O
in O
... O
I O
met O
... O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
and O
he O
came O
round O
to O
me O
at O
midday O
. O

I O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
we O
have O
a O
visa B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Holland B-LOC
. O

He O
immediately O
wrote O
me O
an O
invitation O
from O
home B-TER
, O
and O
following O
my O
telephone O
conversation O
also O
had O
one O
from O
... O
. O

He O
had O
left O
Mannheim B-LOC
to O
stay O
with O
relatives O
and O
was O
imprisoned B-TER
there O
until O
he O
received O
a O
summons O
from O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

However O
he O
was O
not O
badly O
off O
there O
and O
was O
happy O
not O
to O
have O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
stop O
describing O
all O
these O
wonderful O
things O
because O
I O
could O
go O
on O
for O
page O
after O
page O
and O
there O
is O
no O
point O
. O

From O
these O
lines O
you O
can O
get O
an O
impression O
of O
what O
these O
fine O
people O
we O
have O
been O
living O
with O
are O
like O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
there O
are O
also O
perfectly O
decent O
people O
there O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
something O
of O
this O
kind O
has O
happened O
in O
Germany B-LOC
in O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

You O
will O
now O
doubtless O
understand O
why O
I O
began O
by O
quoting O
the O
motto O
of O
the O
speaker O
at O
the O
Chanukah O
celebration O
, O
and O
just O
want O
to O
mention O
once O
again O
that O
these O
occurrences O
should O
remain O
in O
the O
memory O
not O
only O
of O
this O
generation O
but O
also O
the O
next O
, O
and O
that O
no O
Jew O
should O
ever O
forget O
something O
of O
this O
kind O
. O

Children O
of O
Israel O
, O
do O
not O
forget O
what O
Amalek O
did O
to O
you O
. O

However O
now O
I O
just O
want O
to O
mention O
briefly O
all O
the O
things O
that O
at O
the O
time O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
for O
emigration B-TER
. O

I O
am O
not O
doing O
this O
just O
so O
that O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
all O
the O
things O
I O
had O
to O
do O
, O
but O
rather O
so O
that O
you O
will O
understand O
if O
and O
when O
you O
ask O
yourselves O
whether O
this O
or O
that O
could O
not O
have O
been O
sorted O
out O
first O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
were O
summoned O
to O
the O
consulate B-TER
on O
9th O
August O
thanks O
to O
the O
surety O
stood O
for O
us O
by O
... O
. O

Because O
a O
formality O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
with O
the O
surety O
we O
only O
received O
our O
visas B-TER
on O
12th O
September O
. O

It O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
immediately O
delivered O
the O
letter B-TER
to O
the O
Brazilian B-LOC
consulate B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
time O
the O
secretary O
in O
the O
consulate B-TER
told O
me O
it O
could O
take O
three O
months O
and O
Mama O
should O
be O
grateful O
if O
she O
got O
a O
visa B-TER
at O
all O
as O
there O
was O
only O
one O
letter B-TER
of O
recommendation O
. O

As O
I O
have O
already O
told O
you O
, O
Mama O
did O
get O
her O
visa B-TER
so O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
write O
about O
that O
all O
over O
again O
. O

I O
also O
applied O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Uruguay B-LOC
. O

To O
this O
end O
I O
handed O
over O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
for O
both O
of O
us O
. O

The O
visa B-TER
was O
to O
be O
issued O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
the O
consul B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
told O
me O
I O
should O
pack O
everything O
and O
then O
travel O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

There O
I O
would O
receive O
the O
visa B-TER
once O
the O
formalities O
had O
been O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

Yet O
during O
this O
period O
there O
was O
the O
business B-TER
with O
Argentina B-LOC
where O
people O
prepared O
everything O
and O
were O
then O
banned O
from O
going O
, O
so O
they O
did O
not O
get O
their O
visa B-TER
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
they O
had O
given O
up O
their O
homes B-TER
and O
had O
no O
visas B-TER
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
whole O
thing O
with O
Uruguay B-LOC
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
too O
risky O
because O
I O
could O
not O
get O
the O
visa B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
before O
everything O
was O
packed O
. O

This O
is O
all O
sorted O
now O
and O
I O
have O
taken O
the O
paperwork O
with O
me O
in O
case O
it O
comes O
in O
useful O
at O
some O
point O
. O

So O
at O
this O
critical O
point O
Mama O
had O
her O
visa B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
so O
did O
I. O
We O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Frankfurt B-LOC
a O
number O
of O
times O
until O
Mama O
got O
the O
Brazilian B-LOC
visa B-TER
. O

E.g. O
we O
were O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
one O
day O
when O
they O
were O
still O
arresting B-TER
people O
there O
, O
although O
the O
Aktion O
[ O
operation O
] O
, O
as O
they O
called O
the O
whole O
thing O
, O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
died O
down O
. O

The O
Uruguayan B-LOC
consul B-TER
advised O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
immediately O
and O
leave O
on O
the O
next O
ship B-TER
because O
they O
were O
still O
going O
to O
round O
up O
more O
people O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
it O
was O
a O
major O
struggle O
to O
keep O
one O
's O
head O
during O
this O
period O
. O

There O
were O
long O
queues O
of O
Jews O
at O
the O
consulates B-TER
and O
the O
offices O
of O
the O
shipping B-TER
lines I-TER
and O
the O
faces O
of O
these O
beleaguered O
people O
were O
a O
terrible O
sight O
to O
behold O
. O

You O
now O
know O
all O
about O
the O
visa B-TER
question O
. O

Then O
the O
containers O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
, O
because O
we O
were O
fortunate O
in O
that O
our O
furniture O
had O
not O
been O
smashed O
to O
pieces O
. O

Because O
we O
had O
moved O
to O
... O
on O
10th O
October O
the O
relevant O
Devisenstelle O
[ O
foreign O
currency O
office O
] O
for O
us O
was O
in O
... O
, O
and O
they O
were O
much O
more O
conciliatory O
there O
than O
at O
the O
office O
in O
... O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
been O
registered B-TER
in O
... O
for O
four O
weeks O
I O
intended O
to O
submit O
the O
application O
for O
permission O
to O
pack O
to O
the O
office O
in O
... O
. O

The O
cutlery O
and O
the O
linen O
had O
already O
been O
packed O
into O
containers O
ready O
for O
the O
move O
to O
... O
. O

So O
immediately O
after O
10th O
November O
I O
submitted O
the O
list O
of O
what O
we O
were O
taking O
in O
... O
, O
because O
you O
had O
to O
have O
lived O
in O
... O
for O
some O
time O
before O
it O
could O
be O
dealt O
with O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
some O
electrical O
equipment O
from O
a O
Jewish O
family O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
these O
people O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
on O
10th O
November O
. O

So O
once O
we O
had O
collected O
the O
things O
we O
had O
bought O
from O
the O
wives B-TER
of O
the O
business B-TER
owners O
we O
had O
to O
submit O
a O
supplementary O
list O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
some O
photo O
equipment O
for O
myself O
but O
the O
Devisenstelle O
would O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
take O
it O
. O

We O
only O
had O
to O
make O
a O
small O
duty O
payment O
to O
the O
Golddiskontbank O
[ O
gold O
discount O
bank O
] O
for O
the O
new O
things O
, O
and O
in O
this O
respect O
got O
off O
very O
lightly O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
I O
had O
a O
Unbedenklichkeitsschein O
[ O
clearance O
certificate O
] O
for O
both O
of O
us O
from O
the O
Finanzamt O
[ O
tax B-TER
office O
] O
in O
... O
and O
the O
city O
of O
.... O
We O
now O
heard O
that O
no O
more O
of O
these O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
were O
being O
distributed O
, O
and O
that O
before O
one O
could O
be O
drawn O
up O
people O
would O
have O
to O
make O
the O
20 O
% O
Kontribution O
[ O
on O
Jews O
for O
the O
cost O
of O
Novemberaktion O
damage O
] O
. O

Yet O
as O
I O
have O
already O
explained O
to O
you O
, O
no O
one O
was O
allowed O
to O
sell O
securities O
, O
so O
how O
was O
I O
supposed O
to O
pay O
this O
20 O
% O
and O
on O
top O
of O
that O
the O
Reichsfluchtsteuer O
[ O
Reich B-TER
flight O
tax B-TER
] O
for O
Mama O
, O
which O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
paid O
. O

The O
time O
limit O
offered O
protection O
, O
and O
I O
had O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
extended O
again O
and O
again O
. O

But O
during O
that O
period O
one O
only O
went O
to O
the O
authorities B-TER
with O
some O
trepidation O
, O
because O
one O
did O
not O
know O
if O
one O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
after O
all O
if O
someone O
caught O
sight O
of O
one O
there O
. O

In O
the O
... O
they O
recently O
also O
instigated O
an O
accounts B-TER
check O
. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
usually O
the O
Zollfahndung O
[ O
customs O
investigation B-TER
] O
, O
which O
checked O
every O
last O
detail O
with O
a O
fine O
toothcomb O
. O

So O
I O
made O
photocopies O
of O
all O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
that O
I O
had O
, O
then O
had O
them O
witnessed O
by O
a O
notary O
and O
used O
these O
documents O
instead O
. O

I O
frequently O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Devisenstelle O
in O
... O
and O
then O
received O
permission O
for O
Mama O
to O
pack O
, O
though O
in O
my O
case O
there O
were O
still O
some O
questions O
to O
be O
answered O
. O

Following O
various O
visits O
to O
the O
Devisenstelle O
the O
official O
told O
me O
they O
did O
not O
recognise O
me O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsschein O
I O
was O
able O
to O
ensure O
that O
I O
could O
pack O
as O
well O
. O

However O
when O
he O
then O
informed O
me O
that O
the O
outstanding O
question O
had O
not O
been O
answered O
I O
thought O
again O
that O
I O
might O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

Two O
days O
after O
receiving O
the O
Packgenehmigung O
[ O
packing O
permit O
] O
we O
filled O
both O
of O
the O
containers O
and O
the O
suitcases O
and O
had O
everything O
sent O
to O
Rotterdam B-LOC
. O

Through O
a O
notary O
I O
had O
already O
made O
sure O
that O
... O
had O
been O
sent O
power O
of O
attorney O
over O
everything O
and O
arranged O
that O
I O
would O
write O
to O
him O
from O
Holland B-LOC
. O

He O
would O
then O
sort O
out O
the O
Reichsfluchtsteuer O
and O
the O
20 O
% O
Kontribution O
with O
the O
Finanzamt O
. O

I O
am O
now O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
he O
has O
done O
so O
. O

I O
wrote O
to O
him O
from O
Holland B-LOC
once O
the O
containers O
had O
arrived O
in O
Rotterdam B-LOC
so O
that O
they O
did O
not O
get O
held O
up O
for O
any O
reason O
. O

We O
could O
not O
transfer B-TER
anything O
under O
these O
circumstances O
and O
I O
was O
told O
that O
for O
the O
time O
being O
no O
Sperrmark O
[ O
blocked O
Marks O
] O
were O
being O
sold O
. O

However O
in O
Holland B-LOC
I O
heard O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
after O
all O
, O
and O
will O
see O
what O
remains O
after O
the O
taxes B-TER
have O
been O
paid O
and O
how O
it O
can O
be O
transferred B-TER
. O

We O
spent O
a O
week O
in O
Holland B-LOC
and O
boarded O
ship B-TER
in O
Rotterdam B-LOC
on O
the O
13th O
of O
this O
month O
. O

February O
1939 O
Dear O
Sister O
, O
I O
have O
another O
big O
favour O
to O
ask O
you O
. O

I O
have O
received O
the O
following O
sad O
, O
deeply O
sad O
letters B-TER
from O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

C. O
ten O
days O
ago O
I O
got O
one O
from O
a O
little O
girl B-TER
who O
is O
almost O
twelve O
. O

I O
have O
told O
you O
about O
her O
already O
, O
she O
had O
come O
to O
England B-LOC
with O
her O
sister O
and O
was O
called O
back O
by O
a O
relative O
because O
the O
children B-TER
of O
Martha B-PER
( O
a O
cousin O
of O
her O
father O
) O
were O
very O
seriously O
ill B-TER
. O

The O
little O
boy B-TER
recovered O
, O
but O
the O
little O
girl B-TER
of O
four O
, O
whose O
picture O
I O
once O
showed O
you O
, O
died B-TER
. O

Leni B-PER
has O
now O
written O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
child B-TER
has O
died B-TER
and O
that O
Martha B-PER
is O
refusing O
to O
eat B-TER
and O
does O
n’t O
want O
to O
see O
anyone O
, O
not O
even O
her O
little O
boy B-TER
. O

I O
wrote O
her O
a O
consoling O
letter B-TER
and O
then O
yesterday O
received O
an O
even O
sadder O
one O
, O
also O
written O
by O
the O
girl B-TER
. O

Martha B-PER
is O
in O
hospital B-TER
and O
has O
had O
a O
nervous B-TER
breakdown I-TER
, O
but O
not O
just O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
death B-TER
of O
her O
little O
girl B-TER
. O

She O
wrote O
the O
following O
: O
It O
has O
been O
very O
hot O
here O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
and O
in O
order O
to O
cool O
down O
we O
had O
to O
spend O
a O
day O
and O
a O
night O
in O
the O
cellar O
. O

When O
we O
came O
back O
up O
again O
burglars O
had O
been O
there O
and O
stolen O
everything O
– O
money O
, O
linen O
, O
clothes O
, O
jewellery O
, O
even O
things O
belonging O
to O
the O
little O
boy O
– O
and O
that O
’s O
when O
TanteMartha O
had O
her O
nervous O
breakdown O
. O

They O
only O
have O
what O
they O
were O
wearing B-TER
at O
the O
time O
. O

So O
to O
my O
request O
. O

If O
you O
have O
anything O
your O
daughter O
really O
ca O
n’t O
wear B-TER
any O
longer O
and O
anything O
you O
yourself O
do O
n’t O
use O
then O
I O
can O
send O
it O
to O
Martha B-PER
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
big O
mitzvah O
[ O
good O
deed O
] O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
your O
husband O
will O
agree O
. O

The O
girl B-TER
now O
has O
to O
look O
after O
the O
little O
boy B-TER
. O

She O
spends O
the O
day O
with O
friends O
and O
at O
night O
sleeps O
alone O
with O
the O
boy B-TER
in O
the O
flat B-TER
. O

Is O
n’t O
this O
a O
terrible O
tragedy O
? O

more O
than O
clothes B-TER
we O
were O
wearing O
. O

In O
the O
heat O
of O
the O
moment O
I O
said O
some O
words O
I O
should O
n’t O
have O
and O
that O
’s O
why O
I O
've O
been O
here O
for O
the O
last O
three O
months O
. O

Please O
do O
n’t O
think O
ill O
of O
me O
as O
a O
result O
. O

After O
all O
, O
dear O
Tante O
, O
your O
brother O
was O
also O
here O
for O
13 O
weeks O
last O
year O
, O
as O
you O
know O
, O
and O
that O
did O
n’t O
make O
him O
a O
bad O
person O
. O

Thank O
you O
thousands O
of O
times O
for O
the O
lovely O
things O
. O

If O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
them O
I O
would O
have O
to O
wear O
the O
same O
dress B-TER
all O
the O
time O
. O

They O
fit O
very O
well O
, O
although O
the O
shoes B-TER
are O
rather O
large O
, O
but O
I O
can O
still O
wear O
them O
. O

You O
ca O
n’t O
imagine O
how O
happy O
I O
was O
about O
everything O
you O
sent O
and O
above O
all O
because O
they O
came O
from O
you O
. O

I O
am O
always O
thinking O
of O
you O
. O

Please O
do O
n’t O
be O
angry O
that O
Leni B-PER
told O
you O
I O
was O
in O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
was O
too O
embarrassed O
to O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
. O

Please O
do O
n’t O
tell O
Tante O
Berta O
anything O
about O
this O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
'm O
here O
I O
'm O
not O
despondent O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
I O
will O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
be O
with O
my O
little O
boy B-TER
again O
. O

Leni B-PER
is O
a O
good O
child B-TER
and O
if O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
her O
I O
would O
be O
completely O
alone O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
will O
always O
keep O
her O
close O
to O
me O
. O

I O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
if O
Leni B-PER
could O
bring O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
you O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

She O
comes O
and O
visits O
me O
every O
Wednesday O
. O

A O
thousand O
greetings O
and O
kisses O
Your O
Martha B-PER
. O

Very O
best O
wishes O
to O
your O
husband O
, O
daughter O
and O
to O
Tante O
Anna O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
a O
picture O
of O
me O
. O

It O
was O
taken O
here O
and O
is O
n’t O
very O
good O
. O

I O
'll O
give O
the O
letter B-TER
to O
Leni B-PER
. O

I O
hope O
it O
arrives O
safely O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
please O
do O
n’t O
tell O
Berta O
anything O
about O
this O
. O

Vienna B-LOC
, O
April O
1939 O
Dear O
good O
Tanterle O
I O
received O
your O
letter B-TER
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
got O
the O
parcel B-TER
yet O
, O
but O
they O
always O
take O
longer O
. O

I O
will O
write O
to O
you O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
arrives O
. O

This O
time O
it O
was O
n’t O
possible O
to O
include O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
Tante O
Martha B-PER
. O

Onkel O
was O
watching O
too O
carefully O
. O

She O
is O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
write O
or O
receive O
letters B-TER
. O

Dear O
Tante O
, O
you O
say O
we O
should O
put O
our O
faith B-TER
in O
God B-TER
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
believe B-TER
in O
God B-TER
. O

Why O
has O
he O
punished O
us O
so O
harshly O
? O
I O
ca O
n’t O
begin O
to O
describe O
what O
we O
've O
been O
through O
. O

God B-TER
has O
taken O
my O
beloved O
parents O
. O

My O
brother O
was O
in O
the O
same O
rest O
home O
as O
your O
brother O
last O
year O
and O
died B-TER
there O
. O

It O
’s O
the O
same O
home B-TER
that O
our O
Tante O
is O
in O
now O
. O

The O
most O
terrible O
thing O
was O
that O
the O
burglars O
were O
here O
and O
took B-TER
everything O
away B-TER
from O
us O
. O

At O
the O
time O
we O
[ O
were O
] O
hidden O
in O
the O
cellar O
for O
three O
days O
and O
did O
n’t O
dare O
come O
out O
. O

Can O
one O
still O
believe B-TER
in O
God B-TER
in O
these O
circumstances O
? O
Just O
look O
, O
dear O
Tante O
, O
at O
how O
badly O
Onkel O
treats O
us O
– O
I O
'm O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
go I-TER
to O
the O
cinema O
, O
to O
the O
theatre B-TER
, O
I O
'm O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
go I-TER
to O
the O
park O
, O
some O
days O
I O
'm O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
show O
my O
face O
on O
the O
street O
. O

Is O
n’t O
that O
enough O
? O
I O
'm O
not O
quite O
twelve O
years O
old O
but O
sometimes O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
'm O
100 O
years O
old O
. O

But O
I O
'll O
stop O
now O
or O
you O
'll O
get O
angry O
. O

Hansi B-PER
now O
spends O
all O
his O
time O
with O
Frau B-TER
F. O
, O
she O
gets O
15 O
Marks O
a O
month O
for O
him O
from O
the O
Gemeinde O
[ O
community O
] O
and O
I O
eat B-TER
in O
the O
girl O
’s O
refuge B-TER
. O

Hansi B-PER
is O
very O
naughty O
but O
a O
cute O
little O
scallywag O
. O

I O
'm O
sending O
you O
a O
picture O
of O
him O
. O

He O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
stand O
still O
so O
we O
tied O
his O
hands O
to O
the O
railing O
. O

I O
photographed O
him O
. O

In O
the O
next O
letter B-TER
I O
'll O
send O
you O
a O
photograph O
of O
me O
. O

My O
Tante O
has O
a O
lawyer B-TER

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
else O
I O
can O
write O
to O
you O
. O

Vienna B-LOC
, O
May O
1939 O
Dear O
, O
dear O
Tanterle O
I O
received O
your O
kind O
letter B-TER
and O
read O
it O
with O
great O
pleasure O
. O

I O
am O
always O
so O
happy O
when O
you O
write O
to O
me O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
subject O
of O
God B-TER
is O
concerned O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
some O
time O
what O
you O
imagine O
him O
to O
be O
like O
. O

I O
know O
you O
'll O
tell O
me O
that O
God B-TER
is O
an O
invisible O
force O
, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
believe B-TER
in O
him O
all O
the O
same O
. O

Let O
me O
now O
give O
you O
a O
little O
example O
. O

If O
I O
wrote O
to O
you O
telling O
you O
that O
I O
have O
sent O
you O
1,000 O
Marks O
, O
but O
you O
'd O
never O
receive O
it O
because O
the O
money O
remains O
invisible O
, O
would O
you O
still O
believe O
me O
? O
You O
'd O
tell O
me O
that O
you O
'd O
believe O
it O
when O
you O
see O
it O
. O

That O
’s O
what O
I O
say O
too O
. O

I O
only O
believe O
what O
I O
see O
. O

And O
you O
also O
say O
that O
you O
could O
tell O
me O
about O
many O
things O
you O
have O
seen O
. O

Dear O
Tante O
, O
you O
certainly O
have O
n’t O
seen O
the O
kind O
of O
things O
I O
've O
seen O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
change O
the O
subject O
or O
you O
'll O
get O
angry O
. O

I O
think O
a O
lot O
about O
everything O
and O
say O
what O
I O
think O
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O
you O
've O
got O
such O
a O
weak O
heart B-TER
. O

If O
I O
was O
there O
I O
could O
have O
taken O
the O
workload O
off O
you O
. O

I O
can O
already O
cook O
a O
bit O
. O

I O
can O
make O
coffee B-TER
and O
I O
've O
also O
made O
Powidlknödel O
[ O
plum O
jam O
dumplings O
] O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
a O
picture O
of O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
wearing O
everything O
you O
sent O
me O
. O

You O
'll O
laugh O
because O
I O
was O
photographed O
with O
the O
doll O
. O

I O
still O
like O
to O
play O
sometimes O
. O

Please O
do O
n’t O
laugh O
at O
me O
or O
get O
angry O
with O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
pleased O
you O
're O
going O
to O
the O
Comité O
. O

Perhaps O
you O
can O
sort O
something O
out O
. O

I O
'd O
be O
very O
grateful O
if O
you O
could O
... O
Please O
write O
to O
me O
again O
soon O
. O

Your O
letters B-TER
are O
a O
real O
comfort O
to O
me O
. O

For O
today O
best O

a O
million O

Today O

said O
you O
had O

to O
the O

a O
picture O
of O
me O
. O

The O
man B-TER
was O
very O
angry O
and O
said O
I O
was O
a O
stupid O
creature O
and O
that O
the O
Kultusgemeinde O
had O
better O
things O
to O
do O
than O
be O
pestered O
about O
things O
like O
this O
. O

Why O
have O
n’t O
you O
written O
to O
me O
? O
do O
n’t O
you O
believe O
what O
I O
told O
you O
about O
Tante O

? O
I O
will O
try O
to O
get O
a O
confirmation O
from O
them O

send O
it O
to O
you O

please O
do O
n’t O
write O
to O

. O

I O
will O

( O
The O
inquiry O
directed O

to O
ascertain O
whether O
the O

knew O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
the O

Hansi B-PER
are O
travelling O
to O
America B-LOC

At O
the O
moment O
I O

Vienna B-LOC
, O
June O
1939 O
My O
dear O
Tante O
I O
received O
your O
letter B-TER
today O
. O

The O
man B-TER
from O
the O
Kultusgemeinde O
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
knew O
you O
so O
I O
told O
him O
yes O
, O
I O
do O
know O
you O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
know O
I O
was O
n’t O
supposed O
to O
do O
it O
. O

But O
I O
did O
n’t O
say O
that O
my O
Tante O
is O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

That O
’s O
none O
of O
the O

I O

and O
have O
n’t O
had O
a O
reply O
. O

They O
always O
say O
there O
's O
no O
money O
. O

Do O
you O
really O
believe O
that O
the O
Kultusgemeinde O
cares O
about O
its O
own O
people O
? O
You O
could O
perish O
like O
a O
dog O
and O
they O
would O
n’t O
care O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
14 O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
drop O
religion B-TER
entirely O

Please O
do O
n’t O
turn O

want O
to O
have O
anything O
to O

with O
them O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC

But O
you O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
worry O

If O

first O
you O
will O
need O
to O
ask O
if O
she O
would O
be O
allowed O
to O
work O
there O
. O

Tante O
Grete O
has O
handed O
the O
matter O
over O
to O
a O
solicitor O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
and O
we O
hope O
that O
Tante O
Martha B-PER
will O
soon O
be O
able O
to O
come O
home B-TER
. O

So O
in O
the O
name O
of O
Tante O
Martha B-PER
please O
understand O
that O
we O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
the O
Kultusgemeinde O
. O

Please O
do O
n’t O
show O
the O
lady B-TER
from O
the O
Comité O
this O
letter B-TER
. O

Otherwise O
she O
'll O
write O
to O
the O
Kultusgemeinde O
and O
then O
we O
wo O
n’t O
even O
get O
any O
food B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
the O
Comité O
could O
help O
Tante O
Martha B-PER
by O
sending O
her O
something O
so O
that O
she O
can O
improve O
the O
quality O
of O
her O
food B-TER
. O

Now O
I O
'll O
answer O
your O
questions O
. O

My O
sister B-TER
is O
seven O
years O
old O
and O
has O
been O

My O

I O
was O

June O
and O
am O
still O
alive O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

My O
good O
Papi O
was O
53 O
years O
old O
and O
died B-TER
in O
October O
. O

Tante O
Martha B-PER
wo O
n’t O
tell O
me O
what O
he O
died B-TER
of O

He O
was O
a O

inspector O
until O
March O
1938 O

My O

was O
the O
end O
of O
her O

She O

53 O
years O
old O
as O
well O
. O

My O
Papi O
was O
the O
cousin O
of O
Tante O
Martha B-PER

Papi O
's O
mother O
and O
Tante O

Before O

into O
the O
events O
of O
10th O

1938 O

I O
would O
like O
briefly O
to O
list O
the O
reasons O
which O
led O
to O
the O
ruin O
of O
our O
business B-TER
. O

Customers O
started O
the O
boycott B-TER
immediately O
after O
the O
seizure O
of O
power O
, O
it O
intensified O
continuously O
, O
not O
so O
much O
voluntarily O
as O
through O
coercive O
means O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
state O
and O
the O
Party B-TER

. O

However O
, O
since O
this O
did O
not O
lead O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
fast O
enough O
for O
the O
Party B-TER
, O
a O
boycott B-TER
by O
suppliers O
was O
later O
instigated O
. O

First O
the O
Reichsnahrstand O
Reich O
Food O
Corporation O
blocked O
the O
delivery O
of O
flour B-TER
and O
semolina B-TER
, O
then O
consignments O
of O
foreign O
goods O
were O
also O
blocked O
( O
oil B-TER
, O
citrus B-TER
fruit I-TER
, O
later O
partly O
cocoa B-TER
, O
chocolate B-TER
, O
rice B-TER
) O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
1937 O
the O
National O
Salt O
Mines O
in O
Munich B-LOC
informed O
us O
that O
they O
would O
no O
longer O
supply O
salt B-TER
; O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
1938 O
the O
South B-ORG
German I-ORG

, O
with O
whom O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
business B-TER
for O
decades O
, O
made O
the O
same O
announcement O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
manufacturers O
of O
branded O
goods O
partly O
started O
to O
block O
deliveries O
, O
first O
Oetker B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Bielefeld I-ORG
. O

Early O
on O
a O
number O
of O
customers O
cited O
the O
Party B-TER
in O
cases O
of O
non O
- O
payment O
. O

Since O
all O
our O
demands O
were O
justified O
, O
we O
mostly O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
that O
, O
although O
we O
sometimes O
received O
directly O
threatening O
letters B-TER
from O
the O
Party B-TER
telling O
us O
not O
to O
take O
any O
action O
against O
debtors O
. O

Initially O
, O
contact O
with O
the O
authorities B-TER
was O
still O
polite O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1937 O
, O
the O
district O
office O
in O
Weißenburg B-LOC
refused O
to O
issue O
travel O
permits O
, O
which O
was O
actually O
nine O
months O
before O
the O
corresponding O
Reich O
law O
was O
passed O
. O

This O
made O
any O
travel O
impossible O
, O
which O
would O
inevitably O
lead O
to O
the O
demise O
of O
most O
wholesale O
businesses B-TER
. O

In O
1938 O
, O
the O
Finanzamt O
tax O
office O
belatedly O
collected O
the O
sum O
of O
RM B-TER
. O

35,000.- O
for O
turnover O
tax B-TER
, O
since O
allegedly O
the O
conditions O
for O
a O
reduction O
based O
on O
wholesale O
did O
not O
apply O
, O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
written O
permit O
from O
the O
Finanzamt O
. O

During O
a O
meeting O
at O
the O
Finanzamt O
to O
apply O
for O
a O
refund O
the O
clerk O
said O
that O
if O
an O
appeal O
was O
lodged O
the O
regional O
tax B-TER
office I-TER
would O
carry O
out O
a O
further O
audit O
of O
turnover O
tax B-TER
for O
the O
period O
up O
to O
1935 O
. O

This O
was O
indeed O
scheduled O
for O
November O
1938 O
and O
was O
only O
not O
carried O
out O
because O
of O
the O
events O
in O
November O
. O

In O
... O
the O
situation O
was O
such O
that O
for O
years O
it O
had O
been O
almost O
impossible O
to O
let O
children B-TER
out O
on O
the O
streets O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Adults O
were O
also O
not O
safe O
from O
being O
accosted O
by O
school B-TER
children B-TER
; O
until O
the O
start O
of O
1938 O
complaints O
to O
the O
constabulary O
resulted O
in O
some O
peace O
, O
later O
even O
complaints O
were O
pointless O
. O

Window O
smashing O
was O
in O
part O
prevented O
by O
the O
glass O
insurance B-TER
companies I-TER
. O

Any O
purchases O
made O
in O
Jewish B-TER
shops I-TER
and O
talking O
to O
or O
greeting O
of O
a O
Jew O
by O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
were O
immediately O
reported O
to O
the O
mayor O
who O
called O
the O
culprits O
in O
. O

They O
were O
excluded O
from O
city O
deliveries O
, O
support O
etc O
. O

In O
May O
1938 O
, O
hairdressers O
agreed O
en O
bloc O
not B-TER
to I-TER
serve I-TER
Jews O
any O
more O
. O

Individual O
craftsmen O
had O
already O
done O
this O
earlier O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
autumn O
1938 O
during O
the O
Czech B-LOC
war O
crisis O
animosities O
visibly O
increased O
. O

Being O
jostled O
by O
people B-TER
large O
and O
small O
, O
stone B-TER
throwing I-TER
, O
window O
smashing O
, O
removal O
of O
shutters O
during O
the O
day O
were O
not O
uncommon O
. O

The O
unrest O
and O
nervousness O
increased O
even O
further O
when O
it O
was O
learnt O
from O
various O
Jewish B-TER
Gemeinden I-TER
communities O
( O
Leutershausen B-LOC
, O
Ellingen B-LOC
etc O
. O

) O
that O
Jews O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
leave O
their O
houses B-TER
on O
the O
high B-TER
holidays I-TER
, O
leaving O
their O
goods O
and O
chattels O
wherever O
they O
were O
, O
and O
sell O
the O
synagogues B-TER
at O
ludicrously O
low O
prices O
( O
in O
some O
cases O
for O
a O
few O
marks B-TER
) O
. O

I O
want O
to O
add O
that O
my O
17 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
daughter B-TER
witnessed O
a O
mob B-TER
attack I-TER
during O
the O
Juniaktion O
June O
operation O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
girls I-TER
boarding I-TER
school I-TER
was O
attacked B-TER
; O
a O
telephone O
call O
to O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
Überfallkommando O
flying O
squad O
prompted O
the O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
were O
involved O
, O
in O
which O
case O
it O
would O
not O
be O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
Überfallkommando O
. O

On O
10th O
November O
1938 O
between O
4 O
and O
5 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
heard O
steps O
in O
the O
garden O
. O

When O
I O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
eight O
to O
ten O
men B-TER
( O
SA B-ORG
) O
were O
standing O
, O
heavily O
armed O
with O
axes O
, O
hatchets O
, O
daggers O
and O
revolvers O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
woke O
my O
wife B-TER
and O
my O
11 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son B-TER
a O
man B-TER
was O
already O
in O
the O
bedroom B-TER
who O
ordered O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
basement B-TER
and O
immediately O
started O
to O
smash B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
: O
the O
washing O
jug O
and O
bowl O
, O
mirrors O
, O
windows O
, O
furniture O
, O
doors O
etc O
. O

After O
we O
( O
which O
included O
my O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
and O
daughter B-TER
) O
had O
been O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
for O
a O
short O
time O
I O
was O
called O
up O
. O

When O
my O
daughter B-TER
wanted O
to O
come O
with O
me O
she O
was O
pushed O
back O
. O

Somebody O
yelled O
at O
me O
: O
Du O
Lumpyou O
wretch O
, O
you O
know O
that O
since O
12 O
o'clock O
midnight O
you O
have O
been O
declared O
fair O
game O
for O
us O
, O
give O
us O
your O
documents O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
had O
unlocked O
the O
desk O
I O
had O
received O
such O
a O
blow O
to O
the O
face O
that O
my O
glasses O
fell O
off O
and O
broke O
, O
my O
right O
eye O
swelled B-TER
up I-TER
heavily O
and O
my O
pupil B-TER
was I-TER
paralysed I-TER
. O

The O
doctor B-TER
explained O
later O
that O
I O
could O
have O
lost O
my O
sight O
from O
this O
blow O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
shoved O
into O
a O
corner O
and O
indiscriminately O
pelted O
with O
items O
of O
furniture O
. O

That O
I O
only O
sustained O
three O
flesh O
wounds O
and O
no O
serious O
injury O
has O
to O
be O
described O
as O
extremely O
lucky O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
entire O
house B-TER
was O
wrecked O
in O
the O
way O
described O
above O
. O

In O
the O
kitchen B-TER
every O
last O
piece O
of O
crockery O
was O
smashed B-TER
; O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
my O
wife B-TER
was O
hit O
on O
the O
head O
with O
a O
full O
tin O
of O
food O
; O
the O
women B-TER
had O
to O
smash B-TER
wine O
bottles O
and O
preserving O
jars O
themselves O
. O

The O
mob O
came O
after O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
then O
the O
school B-TER
children B-TER
; O
each O
party O
destroyed O
and O
stole O
yet O
more O
. O

It O
can O
be O
stated O
without O
any O
doubt O
that O
the O
SA B-ORG
took O
away O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
writing O
desk O
: O
a O
gentleman O
’s O
gold B-TER
wristwatch I-TER
, O
a O
new O
gentleman O
’s O
wristwatch B-TER
, O
RM B-TER
. O

120.- O
in O
cash B-TER
, O
a O
wedding B-TER
ring I-TER
, O
a O
necklace B-TER
. O

A O
lady O
's O
gold B-TER
wristwatch I-TER
and O
a O
girl O
’s O
ring B-TER
were O
also O
stolen O
on O
the O
same O
Thursday O
. O

It O
should O
be O
added O
that O
a O
part O
of O
the O
large O
tiled O
stoves O
and O
the O
grand O
piano B-TER
were O
also O
destroyed O
. O

By O
the O
time O
my O
wife B-TER
got O
round O
to O
packing O
a O
few O
days O
later O
, O
all O
the O
wardrobes O
and O
drawers O
were O
almost O
completely O
empty O
, O
so O
that O
almost O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
and O
most O
of O
the O
underwear B-TER
had O
been O
stolen O
. O

All O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
in O
were O
treated O
in O
this O
or O
a O
similar O
way O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
synagogue B-TER
with O
all O
the O
Thorarollen O
Torah O
scrolls O
, O
all O
the O
prayer B-TER
books I-TER
, O
tefillin O
[ O
phylacteries O
] O
, O
tallits O
prayer O
shawls O
, O
the O
over-100 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Memorbuch O
memory O
book O
etc O
. O

were O
also O
set O
on O
fire O
and O
burnt B-TER
. O

The O
unusable O
Thorarollen O
, O
which O
had O
been O
stored O
in O
the O
outbuilding O
, O
were O
not O
burnt B-TER
. O

The O
city O
did O
not O
pay O
anything O
for O
the O
large O
plot O
where O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
the O
bath B-TER
house I-TER
, O
the O
teacher B-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
had O
stood O
, O
nor O
for O
the O
outbuilding O
and O
the O
garden O
, O
since O
the O
cost O
for O
clearing O
up O
equalled O
its O
value O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
was O
also O
repeatedly O
desecrated O
before O
and O
after O
the O
10th O
November O
. O

On O
the O
10th O
November O
, O
after O
the O
various O
destruction B-TER
operations O
, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
pack O
some O
underwear B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
and O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
railway B-TER
station I-TER
through O
rows O
of O
the O
rabble O
and O
accompanied O
by O
their O
jeers O
. O

Other O
members O
of O
the O
Gemeinde B-TER
were O
already O
there O
, O
others O
already O
left O
on O
earlier O
trains B-TER
. O

Some O
who O
remained O
were O
badly O
mistreated O
the O
same O
evening O
; O
partly O
by O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
Rathaus O
town O
hall O
the O
over O
70 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
doctor B-TER
... O
in O
particular O
, O
who O
was O
so O
upset O
by O
it O
that O
he O
took B-TER
his I-TER
own I-TER
life I-TER
. O

The O
remaining O
Jews O
had O
to O
leave O
town O
the O
following O
day O
, O
which O
brought O
the O
century O
- O
old O
Jewish O
Gemeinde O
to O
an O
end O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Munich B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
met O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
travelled O
a O
few O
hours O
earlier O
. O

After O
a O
short O
stay O
my O
brother O
and O
I O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

After O
various O
personal O
details O
had O
been O
taken O
down O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
various O
personal O
details O
were O
recorded O
again O
, O
we O
were O
photographed O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
hours O
until O
we O
got O
to O
the O

There O
we O
were O
brought O
before O
the O
doctor B-TER
after O
the O
bath B-TER
and O
had O
to O
announce O
: O

Because O
we O
had O
not O
announced O
ourselves O
loud O
enough O
, O
with O
most O
of O
the O
other O
prisoners B-TER
I O
was O
slapped O
round O
the O
face O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Stabsarzt O
medical O
officer O
. O

Examinations O
were O
not O
carried O
out O
; O
we O
were O
simply O
asked O
: O
Ill O
or O
had O
an O
accident O
? O
However O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
the O
old O
, O
cripples O
, O
diabetics B-TER
and O
the O
mentally B-TER
subnormal I-TER
all O
remained O
in O
custody B-TER
; O
in O
our O
barrack B-TER
e.g. O
an O
elderly O
gentleman O
who O
had O
polio B-TER
, O
could O
hardly O
walk O
and O
speak O
and O
was O
incontinent B-TER
. O

After O
the O
examination O
we O
came O
out O
into O
the O
open O
from O
the O
warm O
bath B-TER
house I-TER
dressed B-TER
only O
in O
short O
shirts B-TER
, O
socks B-TER
, O
trousers B-TER
and O
cotton O
drill O
jacket B-TER
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
stand O
until O
midnight O
whether O
we O
had O
been O
imprisoned B-TER
early O
that O
morning O
, O
like O
individual O
gentlemen O
from O
Munich B-LOC
, O
or O
later O
. O

SS B-TER
men I-TER
watched O
us O
and O
if O
anybody O
was O
seen O
not O
standing O
to O
attention O
properly O
there O
were O
slaps O
around O
the O
face O
and O
shoves O
. O

After O
12 O
o'clock O
we O
were O
led O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

There O
we O
received O
the O
only O
food B-TER
of O
the O
day O
, O
tea B-TER
and O
Kommissbrot O
army O
bread O
. O

The O
barracks B-TER
themselves O
were O
split O
into O
four O
dormitories O
; O
each O
dormitory O
consisted O
of O
two O
rooms B-TER
, O
intended O
for O
50 O
men B-TER
. O

However O
, O
they O
were O
occupied O
by O
200 O
. O

The O
washroom B-TER
and O
toilet B-TER
were O
accordingly O
insufficient O
. O

Initially O
four O
men B-TER
had O
to O
make O
do O
with O
one O
towel O
, O
which O
was O
also O
used O
for O
drying O
the O
crockery O
. O

Later O
towels O
and O
underpants O
could O
be O
bought O
in O
the O
canteen O
. O

The O
daily O
routine O
was O
roughly O
as O
follows O
: O
wake O
- O
up O
at O
5 O
o'clock O
, O
wash B-TER
, O
coffee B-TER
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
eat B-TER
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
there O
were O
blocks O
where O
almost O
always O
one O
had O
to O
eat B-TER
and I-TER
drink I-TER
outside O
, O
i.e. O
standing O
. O

This O
depended O
on O
the O
Stubenältester O
room O
elders O
, O
who O
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
never O
taken O
to O
task O
by O
the O
SS B-ORG
in O
charge O
for O
bad O
treatment O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Since O
the O
rooms B-TER
had O
to O
be O
cleaned O
before O
the O
Appell O
roll O
call O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
leave O
them O
at O
half O
past O
5 O
. O

We O
then O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
some O
time O
on O
the O
camp B-TER
road O
before O
we O
were O
led O
to O
the O
Appellplatz O
parade O
ground O
. O

After O
the O
Appell O
, O
the O
Zimmerdienst O
room O
cleaning O
group O
xx O
( O
which O
included O
me O
most O
of O
the O
time O
) O
was O
allowed O
to O
stand O
down O
, O
whereas O
most O
people B-TER
had O
to O
march O
and O
do O
Exerzieren O
punitive O
drills O
in O
all O
weathers O
until O
after O
11 O
o'clock O
. O

Initially O
Jewish O
former O
officers B-TER
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
, O
later O
only O
Aryans B-TER
. O

After O
lunch B-TER
, O
we O
usually O
had O
30 O
- O
60 O
minutes O
’ O
free O
time O
, O
then O
it O
was O
Appell O
again O
, O
marching O
and O
Exerzieren O
again O
and O
after O
a O
short O
break O
, O
evening O
Appell O
. O

After O
the O
evening O
meal B-TER
we O
were O
free O
until O
bed O
time O
( O
8 O
o'clock O
) O
. O

On O
the O
Appellplatz O
as O
in O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
and O
even O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

One O
was O
[ O
never O
] O
safe O
from O
SS B-ORG
checks O
. O

These O
almost O
never O
passed O
without O
beatings B-TER
and O
shoving O
. O

On O
one O
occasion O
I O
was O
helping O
a O
sick B-TER
person O
along O
when O
an O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
came O
and O
ordered O
me O
to O
let O
him O
walk O
by O
himself O
and O
gave O
me O
a O
push O
from O
behind O
for O
no O
other O
reason O
. O

Similarly O
I O
had O
a O
broom O
thrown O
at O
my O
head O
when O
I O
did O
not O
carry O
out O
an O
order O
fast O
enough O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
, O
luckily O
, O
without O
being O
hit O
. O

Everybody O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Appell O
, O
whether O
sick B-TER
or O
old O
. O

So O
it O
happened O
that O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
weak O
often O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
by O
2 O
- O
4 O
men B-TER
. O

People O
who O
reported O
to O
the O
Revier O
sick O
bay O
or O
the O
doctor B-TER
were O
often O
sent O
away O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
before O
they O
were O
seen O
; O
then O
they O
were O
often O
discharged O
without O
any O
or O
insufficient O
examination O
and O
without O
decent O
treatment B-TER
. O

Special O
events O
On O
one O
occasion O
all O
the O
Jewish O
blocks O
( O
c. O
10,000 O
men B-TER
) O
had O
to O
stand O
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
from O
lunchtime O
till O
6 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Standing O
still O
for O
30 O
- O
60 O
minutes O
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
was O
not O
uncommon O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
evening O
Appell O
we O
were O
often O
bullied O
by O
having O
to O
stand O
still O
for O
longer O
than O
usual O
instead O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
move O
. O

An O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
asked O
an O
acquaintance O
( O
aged O
over O
70 O
) O
his O
name O
. O

When O
he O
gave O
it O
without O
the O
prerequisite O
addition O
Schutzhaftjude O
he O
was O
twice O
slapped O
round O
the O
face O
so O
hard O
that O
he O
fell O
over O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
the O
man B-TER
was O
released B-TER
and O
died B-TER
two O
days O
[ O
after O
] O
his O
release B-TER
, O
another O
man O
2 O
hours O
after O
his O
return O
to O
Munich B-LOC
. O

An O
approximately O
60 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
man B-TER
with O
a O
bladder O
complaint O
asked O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
relieve O
himself O
. O

When O
this O
was O
refused O
and O
he O
replied O
something O
, O
he O
was O
hit O
so O
hard O
that O
he O
fell O
over O
. O

His O
comrades O
were O
forbidden O
to O
help O
him O
up O
. O

In O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
he O
was O
so O
badly O
beaten B-TER
by O
the O
Stubenälteste O
( O
an O
Aryan B-TER
prisoner B-TER
) O
that O
he O
was O
dead B-TER
when O
he O
was O
carried O
off O
the O
square O
. O

One O
evening O
a O
Munich B-LOC
Sanitätsrat O
medical O
consultant O
reported O
to O
the O
doctor B-TER
with O
appendix B-TER
pains O
. O

He O
was O
refused O
treatment B-TER
and O
had O
to O
return O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

The O
following O
morning O
the O
Sanitätsrat O
called O
for O
help O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
a O
colleague O
had O
to O
confirm O
that O
he O
was O
dead B-TER
. O

It O
could O
not O
be O
ascertained O
whether O
a O
ruptured O
appendix B-TER
or O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
had O
been O
the O
cause O
. O

One O
gentleman O
died B-TER
of O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
. O

He O
was O
simply O
left O
there O
and O
it O
took O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
before O
the O
Sanitätspersonal O
medical O
orderlies O
came O
to O
pick O
him O
up O
with O
the O
words O
Another O
one O
's O
croaked O
. O

On O
release B-TER
day O
after O
having O
coffee B-TER
we O
had O
to O
stand O
from O
5 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
until O
the O
train B-TER
left O
Dachau B-LOC
at O
4 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
without O
any O
other O
food B-TER

operation O
of O
November O
1938 O
, O
as O
the O

was O
called O
in O

no O
connection O
with O
the O

Rath I-PER
affair O
, O
since O
preparations O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
had O
been O
completed O
considerably O
earlier O
. O

Even O
whilst O
I O
was O
still O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
, O
my O
wife B-TER
was O
threatened O
that O
I O
would O
not O
be O
released B-TER
from O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
until O
my O

cancelled O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
although O
I O
was O

I O
had O
to O
sell O
my O

over O
our O

after O
the O
1st O
of O
September O
1939 O
. O

The O
next O
day O
we O
saw O
refugees B-TER
from O
Ostrołęka B-LOC
and O
Przasnysz B-LOC
. O

They O
reported O
that O
cannons O
were O
shooting O
there O

The O
refugees B-TER
came O
by O

all O
of O
them O
were O

in O
the O
morning O
, O
a O
German B-TER

landed O

in O
a O
village O
, O
I O

People O
were O
saying O
that O
the O

had O
been O
damaged O
near O
Warsaw B-LOC

The O
pilots O
, O
there O
were O
three O
of O
them O
, O
disappeared O
, O
and O
the O
subsequent O

The O
same O
day O
, O
a O
few O
refugees B-TER
arrived O
from O
Pułtusk B-LOC
. O

Airplanes O
flew O
over O
our O
town O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
drop O
any O
bombs O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
the O
4th O
of O
September O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
refugees B-TER
came O
through O
our O
town O
, O
on O
foot O
or O
by O
horse O
and O
wagon O
, O
Jews O
with O
their O
bundles O
of O
bedclothes O
, O
peasants O
and O
landowners O
with O
cattle O
and O
wagons O
. O

There O
were O
so O
many O
people O
that O
the O
entire O
town O
was O
crowded O
. O

They O
came O
from O
Ciechanów B-LOC
, O
Pułtusk B-LOC
and O
other O
places O
. O

Only O
some O
of O
them O
stayed O
in O
Wyszków B-LOC
for O
the O
night O
, O
the O
majority O
set O
out O
directly O
for O
Warsaw B-LOC

On O
Monday O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
airplanes O
flew O
over O
the O
town O
, O
and O
dropped O
bombs O
in O
the O
vicinity O
. O

The O
stream O
of O
refugees B-TER
continued O
to O
pour O
in O
and O
it O
was O
really O
difficult O
to O
make O
one O
’s O
way O
through O
, O
even O
at O
night O
. O

In O
some O
houses O
, O
influenced O
by O
the O
stream O
of O
refugees B-TER
, O
people O
started O
to O
pack O
their O

. O

In O
my O
parents B-TER
’ O
house O
, O
we O
had O
not O
started O
to O
pack O
our O
things O
yet O
. O

We O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
slept O
through O
the O
night O
undisturbed O
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
the O
5th O
of O
September O
, O
I O
was O
woke O
up O
by O
the O
explosions O
of O
bombs O
, O
thrown O
by O
German B-TER
airplanes O
. O

There O
was O
an O
explosion O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
Pułtuska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Stodolna B-LOC
Street I-LOC
: O
five O
Jews O
were O
killed B-TER
; O
a O
barn O
containing O
oats O
caught O
fire O
and O
burned O
down O
. O

A O
bomb O
fell O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
my O
uncle B-TER
Hershl B-PER
Shults I-PER
’s O
house O
on O
Pułtuska B-LOC

, O
but O
did O
not O
explode O
. O

But O
it O
broke O
the O
doorposts O
and O
window O
frames O
, O
so O
we O
carried O
everything O
out O
of O
his O
house O
. O

Nobody O
from O
my O
uncle B-TER

family B-TER
was O
harmed O
, O
but O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
, O
Antoni B-PER
Zyskowski I-PER

was O
wounded O
. O

There O
were O
attempts O
to O
extinguish O
the O
burning O
barn O
next O
to O
the O
house O
, O
but O
without O
result O
, O
because O
the O
firefighters O
could O
not O
manage O
the O
pumps O
. O

The O
airplanes O
continued O
to O
fly O
and O
inspired O
terror O
in O
the O
population O
. O

The O
German B-TER
airplanes O
dropped O
bombs O
all O
day O
long O
. O

They O
destroyed O
Nadgórze B-LOC
and O
Świętojańska B-LOC
Streets I-LOC

The O
airplanes O
probably O
came O
then O
because O
on O
the O
same O
day O
, O
troops O
had O
appeared O
in O
our O
town O

an O

no O
policemen B-TER
any O
more O
, O
apparently O
they O
disappeared O
the O
same O
day O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
Christians B-TER
and O
Jews O
was O
very O
good O
. O

People O
were O
helping O
each O
other O
. O

Tuesday O
in O
the O
evening O
we O
did O
not O
get O
undressed B-TER
for O
the O
night O
. O

We O
discussed O
to O
where O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

We O
decided O
to O
run B-TER
to I-TER
the O
village O
of O
Sieczychy B-LOC
( O
18 O
km O
from O
Wyszków B-LOC
) O
, O
where O
some O
Germans B-TER
were O
living O
, O
our O
customers O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
nothing O
would O
happen O
in O
a O
place O
where O
Germans B-TER
were O
living O
. O

But O
on O
Wednesday O
we O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
escape B-TER
to O
Sieczychy B-LOC
, O
because O
in O
our O
family B-TER
there O
are O
small O
children B-TER
, O
six O
months O
old O
. O

So O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
the O
6th O
of O
September O
, O
we O
escaped B-TER
to O
Natalin B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
forest O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
the O
forest O
the O
whole O
day O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
the O
airplanes O
. O

All O
day O
long O
, O
we O
had O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
or O
to O
drink O
. O

We O
were O
afraid O
to O
go O
out O
of O
the O
forest O
because O
next O
to O
it O
there O
was O
a O
railroad O
that O
was O
constantly O
being O
bombed O
by O
German B-TER
airplanes O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
return O
to O
town O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
town O
around O
12 O
or O
12:30 O
a.m. O
Some O
buildings O
were O
still O
burning O
. O

We O
saw O
flashes O
and O
heard O
cannonfire O
, O
a O
sign O
that O
the O
front O
was O
already O
near O
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
except O
for O
the O
high O
school O
building O
, O
nothing O
else O
had O
been O
destroyed O
. O

On O
Thursday O
, O
the O
7th O
of O
September O
, O
the O
street O
was O
empty O
. O

Only O
the O
refugees B-TER
and O
Polish B-LOC
troops O
were O
hurrying O
through O
toward O
the O
bridge O
on O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

The O
German B-TER
airplanes O
continued O
to O
drop O
bombs O
. O

Around O
3 O
p.m. O
Szkolna B-LOC
and O
Chopin B-LOC
Streets I-LOC
Fryderyk O
started O
to O
burn O
. O

The O
fire O
lasted O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
came O
out O
from O
our O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
because O
the O
fire O
was O
already O
threatening O
us O
. O

We O
tried O
everything O
to O
prevent O
the O
fire O
from O
progressing O
. O

The O
first O
row O
of O
houses O
on O
Wąska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
were O
rescued O
. O

The O
other O
houses O
, O
on O
Szkolna B-LOC
and O
Chopin B-LOC
Streets I-LOC
, O
burned O
down O
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
, O
around O
3 O
p.m. O
, O
a O
bomb O
hit O
the O
butcher O
shops O
and O
destroyed O
a O
wall O
of O
Leybl B-PER
Przytycki I-PER
’s O
shop O
on O
Kościuszko B-LOC
street I-LOC
. O

There O
was O
soda O
- O
water O
, O
kvass O
and O
beer O
there O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
the O
Polish B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
robbed O
the O
shop O
and O
drank O
everything O
up O
. O

Polish B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
were O
also O
in O
our O
courtyard O
, O
slipping O
along O
the O
walls O
, O
and O
shooting O
with O
their O
guns O
at O
German B-TER
airplanes O
. O

Therefore O
we O
were O
very O
scared O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
drop O
bombs O
on O
our O
house O
. O

At O
12 O
a.m. O
we O
consulted O
the O
Polish B-TER
officers O
about O
what O
to O
do O
. O

They O
advised O
us O
to O
escape B-TER
with O
the O
army B-TER
. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
on O
Friday O
morning O
both O
bridges O
would O
be O
blown O
up O
and O
afterwards O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
. O

But O
one O
of O
our O
acquaintances O
, O
a O
Jewish B-TER
soldier I-TER
from O
Wyszków B-LOC
, O
advised O
us O
to O
stay O
, O
because O
of O
our O
small O
children B-TER
. O

So O
we O
stayed O
. O

At O
night O
we O
cooked O
a O
meal B-TER
, O
because O
during O
the O
day O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
do O
anything O
. O

We O
did O
not O
go O
to O
sleep O
. O

Throughout O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
Polish B-LOC
troops O
marched O
through O
, O
in O
such O
a O
dense O
throng O
that O
we O
could O
not O
make O
our O
way O
through O
them O
to O
get O
to O
the O
pump O
at O
the O
market B-LOC
square I-LOC
to O
get O
some O
water O
. O

On O
Friday O
, O
the O
8th O
of O
September O
, O
the O
German B-TER
airplanes O
continued O
to O
drop O
bombs O
. O

There O
were O
not O
many O
Polish B-LOC
troops O
left O
. O

Soldiers B-TER
drove O
through O
only O
rarely O
on O
the O
roads O
from O
Ostrów B-LOC
Mazowiecka I-LOC
and O
Pułtusk B-LOC
. O

There O
were O
no O
more O
civilian O
refugees B-TER
. O

No O
more O
bombs O
were O
fallings O
in O
town O
anymore O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
Polish B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
remained O
. O

The O
retreating O
army B-TER
blew O
up O
Elye B-PER
- I-PER
Meyer I-PER
Goldman I-PER
’s O
bakery O
; O
the O
population O
was O
told O
to O
take O
the O
flour O
, O
in O
order O
not O
to O
leave O
it O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Mainly O
Jews O
were O
left O
in O
town O
, O
and O
they O
took O
the O
flour O
. O

The O
Poles B-LOC
had O
apparently O
already O
escaped B-TER
, O
because O
we O
did O
not O
see O
any O
. O

German B-TER
airplanes O
flew O
quite O
low O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
shoot O
. O

We O
did O
not O
run O
away O
from O
them O
, O
because O
we O
believed O
that O
after O
the O
Poles B-LOC
had O
left O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
not O
shoot O
any O
more O
. O

Until O
4 O
p.m. O
it O
was O
calm O
. O

Around O
4 O
o’clock O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
violent O
shooting O
was O
heard O
. O

Apparently O
the O
bridges O
were O
being O
blown O
up O
. O

We O
crept O
into O
our O
homes O
. O

Around O
5 O
o’clock O
a O
small O
house O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
Wąska B-LOC
and O
Szkolna B-LOC
Streets I-LOC
caught O
fire O
. O

I O
and O
some O
other O
Jews O
ran O
over O
to O
help O
. O

But O
the O
German B-TER
artillery O
opened O
fire O
right O
then O
, O
so O
we O
dispersed O
and O
ran O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
the O
prayer B-TER
house I-TER
. O

The O
right O
side O
of O
the O
market B-LOC
square I-LOC
caught O
fire O
. O

All O
the O
people O
gathered O
in O
the O
courtyard O
of O
the O
prayer B-TER
house I-TER
and O
descended O
[ O
the O
stairs O
] O
to O
the O
ritual B-TER
bath I-TER
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
enter O
the O
prayer B-TER
house I-TER
, O
because O
in O
the O
Talmud B-TER
- I-TER
Torah I-TER
classroom O
inside O
lay O
10 O
- O
15 O
corpses B-TER
, O
people O
who O
had O
perished B-TER
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
, O
whom O
it O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
possible O
to O
bury B-TER
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
. O

There O
was O
an O
unbearable O
smell O
there O
. O

There O
was O
a O
loud O
lament O
in O
the O
prayer B-TER
house I-TER
– O
women B-TER
were O
crying O
, O
men B-TER
were O
saying O
the O
deathbed B-TER
confessional O
prayers B-TER
. O

The O
shooting O
lasted O
from O
5 O
p.m. O
until O
around O
2 O
a.m. O
A O
German B-TER
scout O
, O
alone O
on O
a O
horse O
, O
arrived O
in O
town O
and O
stopped O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
Kościuszko B-LOC
and O
Wąska B-LOC
Streets I-LOC
, O
by O
the O
police B-TER
station O
. O

That O
was O
around O
10 O
p.m. O
We O
looked O
out O
through O
a O
crack O
[ O
in O
the O
shutter O
] O
, O
and O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
conflagration O
we O
saw O
the O
German B-TER
. O

Around O
2 O
a.m. O
it O
became O
calmer O
and O
we O
ran O
, O
keeping O
close O
to O
the O
walls O
, O
to O
our O
house O
, O
which O
was O
still O
undamaged O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
my O
father B-TER
made O
kiddush B-TER
the O
Sabbath O
blessing O
over O
wine O
, O
although O
it O
was O
dark O
; O
we O
ate O
a O
symbolic O
portion O
of O
food B-TER
and O
said O
the O
end O
- O
of- O
meal B-TER
blessing B-TER
. O

Shooting O
could O
still O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
distance O
. O

We O
did O
not O
undress B-TER
to O
sleep O
and O
could O
only O
doze O
during O
the O
night O
. O

At O
dawn O
, O
the O
artillery O
fire O
intensified O
and O
the O
town O
was O
burning O
on O
all O
sides O
. O

On O
Saturday O
the O
9th O
of O
September O
, O
around O
11 O
a.m. O
, O
we O
ran O
away O
from O
our O
small O
wooden O
house O
and O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
house O
made O
of O
bricks O
. O

On O
Saturday O
afternoon O
, O
when O
I O
was O
looking O
out O
through O
the O
courtyard O
, O
I O
spotted O
a O
Jew O
running O
. O

Three O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
ran O
after O
him O
aiming O
their O
guns O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
I O
heard O
shots O
– O
the O
Jew O
was O
apparently O
shot B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

Buildings O
continued O
to O
catch O
fire O
. O

I O
saw O
a O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
hanging O
around O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
Pułtuska B-LOC
and O
Ogrodowa B-LOC
Streets I-LOC
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
a O
small O
house O
started O
to O
burn O
– O
apparently O
the O
German B-TER
had O
set O
fire O
to O
it O
. O

Through O
a O
shutter O
I O
saw O
a O
group O
of O
eight O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
use O
explosives O
on O
one O
of O
shop O
of O
Nielipowiczun B-PER
’s O
shops O
on O
Wąska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
the O
building O
caught O
fire O
right O
away O
. O

On O
Saturday O
afternoon O
the O
Germans B-TER
shot O
in O
through O
the O
windows O
into O
several O
houses O
on O
the O
market O
square O
. O

Afterwards O
they O
set O
fire O
to O
them O
. O

Some O
wounded O
Jews O
, O
shot O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
came O
to O
us O
in O
Marke O
’s O
Spelling O
uncertain O
. O

house O
on O
Wąska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

I O
know O
that O
the O
Portowicz B-PER
Spelling O
uncertain O
. O

family B-TER
was O
wounded O
( O
the O
father B-TER
in O
the O
arm O
, O
the O
mother B-TER
in O
the O
leg O
and O
head O
, O
and O
the O
four O
- O
year O
- O
old O
child B-TER
in O
the O
leg O
) O
. O

When O
we O
saw O
that O
the O
houses O
across O
the O
street O
were O
burning O
, O
and O
that O
the O
houses O
next O
to O
us O
, O
ignited O
by O
the O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
, O
were O
also O
catching O
fire O
, O
we O
were O
afraid O
that O
our O
house O
would O
be O
also O
set O
on O
fire O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
shot O
into O
our O
house O
too O
, O
through O
the O
window O
, O
but O
nobody O
was O
hit O
because O
we O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

So O
we O
went O
out O
of O
the O
house O
( O
around O
11 O
a.m. O
) O
and O
we O
ran O
into O
a O
Polish B-LOC
house O
with O
a O
damaged O
roof O
. O

We O
ran O
into O
the O
ditch O
that O
encircled O
the O
bath O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
shot O
after O
us O
, O
hit O
Tsirl B-PER
Holand I-PER
( O
60 O
years O
old O
) O
, O
and O
killed B-TER
her O
. O

Her O
son B-TER
– O
Fishl B-PER
Holand I-PER
– O
was O
wounded O
in O
the O
leg O
; O
a O
woman B-TER
– O
Shoshke B-PER
( O
60 O
years O
old O
) O
was O
killed B-TER
. O

There O
were O
other O
murder B-TER
victims B-TER
there O
, O
and O
the O
corpses B-TER
smelled O
bad O
, O
but O
because O
I O
was O
running O
, O
I O
could O
not O
recognize O
them O
. O

From O
the O
ditch O
we O
crossed O
over O
into O
the O
cellars O
, O
through O
the O
cellar O
windows O
in O
the O
bath O
. O

After O
a O
half O
- O
hour O
, O
the O
fire O
had O
already O
reached O
the O
bath O
. O

I O
went O
from O
the O
cellar O
to O
another O
small O
room O
, O
to O
check O
if O
the O
fire O
had O
already O
reached O
that O
far O
. O

When O
I O
came O
back O
, O
nobody O
was O
left O
in O
the O
cellar O
except O
for O
Moyshe B-PER
- I-PER
Zelik I-PER
Ostry I-PER
and O
his O
mother B-TER
; O
everyone O
else O
had O
run B-TER
away I-TER
. O

We O
remained O
in O
the O
cellar O
from O
Sunday O
the O
10th O
of O
September O
until O
Wednesday O
, O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
Rosh O
- O
Hashanah O
Jewish O
New O
Year O
. O

( O
the O
13th O
of O
September O
) O
. O

More O
people O
arrived O
on O
Sunday O
the O
10th O
in O
the O
daytime O
, O
and O
so O
we O
passed O
the O
time O
there O
until O
Wednesday O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
eat B-TER
because O
we O
happened O
to O
find O
a O
packet O
of O
old O
pastries B-TER
there O
, O
which O
someone O
had O
apparently O
lost O
on O
the O
run O
. O

At O
night O
we O
slipped O
out O
into O
the O
courtyard O
to O
get O
water O
from O
the O
pump O
. O

We O
relieved O
our O
physiological O
needs O
in O
one O
of O
the O
cellars O
, O
because O
we O
were O
afraid O
to O
go O
outside O
. O

On O
the O
same O
Sunday O
, O
a O
German B-TER
approached O
the O
cellar O
window O
. O

I O
was O
hiding B-TER
in O
another O
cellar B-TER
room I-TER
, O
in O
the O
bath B-TER
boiler I-TER
, O
and O
I O
heard O
gunshots O
. O

On O
Sunday O
at O
noon O
, O
more O
people O
arrived O
in O
the O
cellars O
, O
bringing O
with O
them O
a O
Jew O
whom O
they O
had O
found O
on O
the O
street O
, O
Binyomtshe B-PER
( O
70 O
years O
old O
) O
, O
wounded O
in O
the O
leg O
. O

They O
took O
him O
into O
the O
cellar O
and O
put O
him O
in O
a O
bed O
that O
was O
there O
– O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
where O
it O
came O
from O
. O

The O
Jew O
died B-TER
on O
Tuesday O
the O
12th O
of O
September O
, O
without O
any O
[ O
medical B-TER
] O
help O
. O

The O
son B-TER
of O
Moyshe O
- O
Borekh O
the O
butcher O
also O
lay O
there O
, O
wounded O
in O
the O
belly O
. O

And O
opposite O
the O
bath O
, O
in O
a O
nearby O
orchard O
, O
lay O
a O
Jew O
from O
Pułtusk B-LOC
, O
wounded O
in O
the O
arm O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
seven B-TER
- I-TER
year I-TER
- I-TER
old I-TER
boy I-TER
with O
a O
piece O
of O
shoulder O
torn O
off O
; O
he O
bled O
a O
lot O
and O
smelled O
terrible O
, O
it O
was O
simply O
impossible O
to O
be O
near O
him O
. O

We O
learned O
from O
Simkhe B-PER
- I-PER
Yankev I-PER
Vengrov I-PER
, O
who O
looked O
like O
a O
German B-TER
and O
spoke O
German B-TER
, O
and O
who O
came O
to O
us O
in O
the O
cellar O
, O
that O
more O
than O
forty O
people O
were O

As O
I O

I O
was O

However O
, O
I O
continued O

A O
German B-TER

I O

even O

The O
Poles B-TER
had O
a O

attitude O
toward O
the O
Jews O
too O
, O
although O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
of O

But O
they O
accepted O

very O
quietly O

By O

and O
all O
the O

On O

the O

The O
Jews O
prayed B-TER
without O

, O
but O
less O
fearfully O
than O
on O
Rosh O

. O

After O
the O
service B-TER

the O

was O
blown O

On O

The O
Jewish O
population O
was O
preparing O
for O
war B-TER
. O

Groups O
were O
formed O
, O
people O
worked O
in O
the O
trenches O
, O
all O
tasks O
and O
injunctions O
were O
accomplished O
zealously O
. O

On O
the O
night O
of O
6th O
September O
there O
was O
an O
alert O
, O
our O
whole O
area O
was O
mobilised O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
trenches O
on O
Bielany B-LOC

At O
the O
gathering O
place O
anarchy O
reigned O
, O
there O
was O
no O
leader O
; O
several O
trams O
without O
conductors O
were O
parked O
there O
. O

When O
we O
got O
to O
Bielany B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
sent O
back O
– O
all O
of O
us O
, O
those O
who O
came O
with O
shovels O
or O
without O
. O

We O
heard O
loud O
shooting O
. O

People O
started O
to O
run O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

Thousands O
of O
people O
left O
Warsaw B-LOC
at O
that O
time O
, O
by O
the O
road O
to O
Minsk B-LOC
Mazowiecki I-LOC
or O
to O
Lublin B-LOC

I O
met O
a O
policeman B-TER
that O
morning O
( O
on O
the O
7th O
[ O
of O
September O
] O
) O
. O

He O
said O
that O
they O
[= O
the O
police B-TER
] O
were O
retreating O
together O
with O
the O
army B-TER
by O
the O
road O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
and O
that O
the O
young O
people O
should O
also O
come O
with O
them O
. O

So O
I O
set O
off O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
road O
stretched O
masses O
of O
soldiers B-TER
and O
civilians O
. O

The O
whole O
road O
was O
crowded O
with O
people O
. O

The O
German B-TER
planes O
did O
not O
let O
them O
rest O
, O
but O
bombed O
constantly O
. O

People O
were O
constantly O
hiding O
, O
victims O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
road O
: O
soldiers B-TER
, O
civilians O
, O
horses O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

From O
the O
field O
we O
would O
grab O
carrots B-TER
, O
beetroot B-TER
, O
tomatoes B-TER
; O
it O
was O
also O
hard O
to O
find O
water O
, O
the O
wells O
were O
already O
empty O
. O

Near O
Ryki B-LOC
, O
troops O
were O
camped O
, O
with O
a O
high O
- O
ranking O
officer O
. O

He O
was O
sending O
the O
people O
back O
: O
an O
order O
from O
Starzyński B-PER
, O
we O
were O
to O
go O
back O
to O
defend O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

He O
only O
let O
pass O
a O
certain O
category O
of O
conscripts O
. O

Therefore O
a O
lot O
of O
civilians O
returned O
, O
and O
so O
did O
I. O
On O
the O
way O
back O
there O
was O
heavy O
bombing O
, O
Kołbiel B-LOC
, O
Minsk B-LOC
Mazowiecki I-LOC
, O
Garwolin B-LOC
were O
burning O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
through O
. O

We O
kept O
on O
going O
to O
Celestynów B-LOC
- O
Otwock B-LOC
. O

There O
we O
got O
a O
kilo O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

In O
Otwock B-LOC
only O
a O
few O
places O
suffered O
damages O
. O

From O
there O
we O
took O
the O
local O
train B-TER
to O
Wawer B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
planes O
were O
constantly O
overhead O
. O

Masses O
of O
people O
lay O
dead B-TER
or O
wounded O
, O
there O
was O
no O
place O
to O
hide O
. O

Wawer B-LOC
. O

We O
went O
into O
a O
house O
that O
was O
standing O
open O
, O
a O
small O
wooden O
house O
. O

There O
we O
stayed O
the O
whole O
day O
Sunday O
, O
10th O
September O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
continued O
toward O
Warsaw B-LOC

The O
dead B-TER
lay O
on O
the O
road O
, O
people O
and O
horses O
. O

There O
were O
lost O
helmets O

All O

In O
Praga B-LOC

, O
every O
few O
minutes O
we O
had O
to O
take O
shelter O
in O
a O
doorway O
. O

Praga B-LOC
was O
already O
unrecognizable O
, O
particularly O
around O
the O
Przem.[ienienia B-LOC

Pańskiego I-LOC
hospital B-TER

near O
the O

, O
on O
the O

, O
already O
we O
could O
not O
cross O
Kierbedź O
bridge O
, O
which O
was O
badly O
damaged O
. O

I O
reached O
Warsaw B-LOC
only O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
Warsaw B-LOC
streets O
were O
empty O
, O
unrecognizable O
. O

On O
Nalewki- B-LOC
Franciszkańska I-LOC
they O
were O
grabbing O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
details O
, O
for O
the O
trenches O
. O

In O
the O
Polish B-TER
districts O
, O
work B-TER
was O
voluntary O
, O
they O
picked O
up O
people O
in O
the O
streets O
only O
in O
the O
Jewish O
district O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Jewish O
professional O
or O
party O
organizations O
( O
Bundists B-ORG
, O
Skifists O
, O
even O
in O

) O
, O
and O
Jews O
with O
[ O
traditional O

Jewish O
hats O
, O
were O
going O
to O
work B-TER
in O
organized O
groups O
with O
shovels O
. O

At O
Senatorska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
29 I-LOC
, O
Luxenburg B-LOC
Gallery I-LOC
, O
there O
was O
a O
bureau O
to O
recruit O

, O
which O
was O
besieged O
by O
Jews O
. O

Some O
Poles B-TER
even O
expressed O
their O
displeasure O
that O
there O
were O
too O
many O
Jews O
. O

I O
myself O
worked B-TER
with O
a O
group O
of O
Jewish O
transport O
workers B-TER
, O
we O
sang O
revolutionary O
songs O
, O
no O
one O
could O
expect O
that O
in O
a O
few O
days O
all O
the O
work B-TER
would O
be O
for O
nothing O
. O

My O
neighborhood O
had O
suffered O
badly O
from O
the O
bombing O
. O

In O
my O
house O
, O
Muranowska B-LOC
6 I-LOC
- I-LOC
8 I-LOC
, O
the O
adjoining O
wall O
had O
completely O
collapsed O
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
move O
out O
. O

We O
found O
a O
place O
at O
Prosta B-LOC
14 I-LOC
, O
in O
the O
high O
school O
. O

It O
had O
a O
shelter O
, O
where O
there O
were O
already O
refugees B-TER
from O
Żyrardów B-LOC
, O
Ząbki B-LOC
, O
Błonie B-LOC
and O
others O
. O

There O
were O
whole O
families B-TER
with O
children B-TER
. O

They O
had O
been O
given O
the O
cellars O
of O
the O
school O
. O

The O
bombings O
took O
place O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
evening O
, O
every O
day O
another O
district O
was O
hit O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
shrapnel O
, O
as O
the O
Germans B-TER
got O
closer O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

The O
planes O
threw O
out O
appeals O
telling O
us O
to O
surrender O
. O

In O
the O
Jewish O
neighborhood O
, O
the O
hardest O
hit O
streets O
were O
Stawki B-LOC
, O
Niska B-LOC
, O
and O
parts O
of O
Miła B-LOC
. O

Also O
badly O
hit O
were O
Nalewki B-LOC
and O
Franciszkańska B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
heavily O
bombed O
the O
churches O
on O
Leszno B-LOC
, O
Grzybów B-LOC
, O
Zbawiciela B-LOC
Square I-LOC
and O
others O
. O

The O
worst O
damage O
was O
in O
Wola B-LOC
, O
Mokotów B-LOC
and O
Marymont B-LOC
. O

The O
hardest O
hit O
of O
all O
were O
the O
houses O
with O
military B-TER
points O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
entered O
Warsaw B-LOC
on O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
October O
. O

First O
they O
opened O
soup B-TER
kitchens I-TER
to O
feed O
the O
population O
, O
who O
rushed O
to O
the O
kitchens B-TER
. O

A O
crowd O
of O
50 O
000 O
gathered O
on O
Broni B-LOC
Square I-LOC
, O
standing O
in O
4 O
rows O
which O
extended O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
Bonifraterska B-LOC
. O

From O
4 O
tables O
with O
4 O
large O
vats O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
distributed O
food B-TER
, O
and O
they O
filmed O
it O
all O
from O
a O
truck O
and O
played O
military B-TER
marches O
. O

Someone O
greeted O
the O
soldiers B-TER
in O
Polish O
. O

They O
made O
no O
distinction O
between O
non O
- O
Jews O
and O
Jews O
, O
even O
those O
wearing O
Hasidic O
dress B-TER
. O

But O
in O
the O
following O
days O
there O
began O
to O
be O
a O
difference O
between O
Jews O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
. O

For O
clearing O
the O
rubble O
they O
rounded O
up O
only O
Jews O
in O
the O
Jewish O
quarters O
. O

In O
the O
Polish B-TER
quarters O
this O
was O
not O
done O
. O

By O
this O
time O
there O
was O
no O
water O
, O
no O
electricity O
; O
Jews O
had O
to O
go O
for O
water O
to O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
or O
to O
the O
wells O
, O
and O
already O
some O
Poles B-TER
were O
starting O
to O
say O
things O
like O
: O
Hitler B-PER
's O
here O
already O
, O
he O
'll O
soon O
be O
getting O
even O
with O
the O
Jews O
. O

By O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
, O
I O
once O
saw O
the O
following O
: O
A O
young O
Gentile O
grabbed O
a O
large O
pitcher O
of O
water O
that O
an O
elderly O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
was O
carrying O
and O
poured O
it O
all O
out O
. O

This O
was O
already O
quite O
a O
distance O
from O
the O
river O
. O

An O
older O
man B-TER
, O
also O
a O
Gentile O
, O
reacted O
like O
this O
: O
What O
kind O
of O
a O
person O
are O
you O
, O
to O
do O
this O
in O
such O
a O
time O
. O

What O
would O
you O
do O
if O
someone O
did O
that O
to O
you O
? O
Life O
was O
very O
hard O
. O

Bread B-TER
was O
impossible O
to O
find O
. O

Potatoes B-TER
cost O
3 O
złoty O
a O
kilo O
and O
were O
also O
hard O
to O
find O
. O

Brave O
young O
men B-TER
went O
out O
to O
the O
fields O
, O
dug O
up O
potatoes B-TER
and O
sold O
them O
. O

No O
transportation O
existed O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
following O
scene O
: O
A O
Gentile O
came O
up O
to O
a O
Jewish O
boy O
to O
buy O
cigarettes O
. O

He O
asked O
the O
price O
, O
then O
quickly O
called O
over O
a O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
, O
who O
took O
all O
the O
cigarettes O
away O
from O
the O
boy O
and O
tossed O
them O
to O
the O
crowd O
. O

The O
Gentiles O
caught O
them O
. O

Another O
scene O
: O
a O
policeman B-TER
came O
up O
to O
woman O
selling O
herring B-TER
and O
asked O
the O
price O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
it O
all O
and O
gave O
it O
out O
to O
the O
crowd O
. O

The O
shops O
were O
completely O
closed O
. O

All O
commerce O
was O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

Before O
the O
Germans B-TER
arrived O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
robbery O
: O
Polish B-TER
soldiers B-TER
would O
steal O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
criminals B-TER
who O
had O
been O
let O
out O
of O
jail B-TER
. O

There O
were O
whole O
gangs O
. O

We O
posted O
guards O
by O
the O
gates O
. O

Some O
firms O
, O
however O
, O
themselves O
distributed O
their O
goods O
to O
the O
population O
, O
just O
so O
it O
would O
n’t O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Warsaw B-LOC
under O
the O
Germans B-TER
: O
Nowolipki B-LOC
from O
Zamenhof B-LOC
to O
Karmelicka B-LOC
was O
cleared O
of O
all O
Jews O
. O

Within O
the O
space O
of O
one O
or O
two O
hours O
all O
Jews O
had O
to O
leave O
their O
homes O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
cleaned O
up O
the O
street O
, O
there O
was O
no O
passage O
off O
Nowolipki B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
would O
grab O
Jews O
for O
work O
details O
and O
also O
make O
fun O
of O
them O
. O

I O
myself O
saw O
this O
scene O
: O
they O
asked O
an O
elderly O
Jew O
to O
clean O
the O
pavement O
with O
his O
beard O
. O

The O
Jew O
bent O
down O
and O
began O
wiping O
with O
his O
hands O
and O
they O
did O
n’t O
bother O
him O
any O
more O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
they O
forced O
people O
to O
work B-TER
but O
there O
were O
no O
shovels O
, O
no O
tools O
, O
and O
they O
had O
to O
work B-TER
with O
their O
bare O
hands O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
population O
stood O
in O
line O
to O
get O
bread B-TER
, O
mainly O
in O
the O
Polish B-TER
neighborhoods O
. O

They O
would O
throw O
Jews O
off O
the O
line O
. O

If O
a O
Jew O
refused O
to O
leave O
they O
would O
call O
over O
a O
German B-TER
policeman B-TER
and O
point O
to O
him O
: O
Jude O
! O
Jude O
! O
and O
they O
would O
throw O
him O
out O
. O

Particularly O
good O
at O
these O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
acts O
were O
the O
volunteer O
members O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
militia B-TER
: O
One O
of O
these O
took O
hold O
of O
a O
Jew O
by O
his O
lapel O
and O
pulled O
him O
off O
the O
line O
. O

For O
Jews O
there O
's O
no O
bread O
! O
For O
some O
Gentiles O
a O
little O
business O
sprang O
up O
– O
to O
sell O
loaves O
of O
bread B-TER
to O
Jews O
at O
exorbitant O
prices O
. O

A O
new O
means O
of O
livelihood O
became O
available O
for O
Jews O
also O
during O
the O
water O
shortage O
: O
carrying O
water O
on O
pushcarts O
; O
there O
were O
also O
Jews O
who O
would O
stand O
in O
line O
( O
for O
a O
fee O
) O
. O

Until O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
a O
four O
- O
page O
edition O
of O
the O
Folkstsaytung B-TER
came O
out O
every O

; O
once O

Yiddish O

but O
they O
all O
carried O
exactly O
the O

contents O
. O

There O
were O
2 O
appeals O
from O
Starzyński B-PER
to O
the O

. O

12 O
guarantors O
were O
appointed O

to O

After O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
under O
the O
Germans B-TER
I O
decided O
to O
escape B-TER
; O
I O
expected O
that O
later O
things O
would O
become O
worse O
, O
that O
there O
would O
be O
special O
persecutions B-TER
for O
the O
younger O
generation O
. O

The O
city O
made O
a O
terrifying O
impression O
after O
the O
bombing O
. O

I O
left O
for O
Falenica B-LOC
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
from O
there O
. O

In O
Falenica B-LOC
the O
entire O
Handlowa B-LOC
Street I-LOC
had O
been O
burned O
. O

In O
Falenica B-LOC
the O
Germans B-TER
shot B-TER
a O
number O
of O
Jews O
, O
supposedly O
taking O
them O
to O
a O
prisoners B-TER
' O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
shooting B-TER
them O
on O
the O
way O
. O

As O
a O
former O
patient O
of O
the O
Medem B-LOC
Sanatorium I-LOC
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
look O
at O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
in O
Miedzeszyn B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
reached O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
I O
found O
no O
one O
there O
. O

So O
I O
went O
in O
to O
see O
the O
guardian O
Maksimenko B-PER
and O
he O
described O
to O
me O
in O
tears O
the O
plundering B-TER
of O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
: O
there O
were O
Polish B-TER
soldiers B-TER
in O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
and O
they O
robbed O
the O
place O
together O
with O
the O
civilian O
population O
. O

The O
soldiers B-TER
simply O
let O
the O
civilians O
in O
and O
whoever O
wanted O
to O
could O
steal O
whatever O
they O
wanted O
, O
and O
they O
took O
everything O
, O
beds O
, O
mattresses O
, O
everything O
. O

With O
tears O
, O
Maksimenko B-PER
explained O
: O
All O
he O
could O
do O
was O
to O
kill B-TER
himself I-TER
, O
for O
it O
was O
his O
responsibility O
and O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
prevent O
the O
destruction O
. O

As O
we O
entered O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
we O
were O
struck O
by O
a O
terrible O
smell O
. O

A O
great O
number O
of O
dead B-TER
horses O
were O
buried O
here O
. O

The O
sanatorium B-TER
buildings O
were O
standing O
but O
everything O
was O
in O
disorder O
, O
everything O
thrown O
about O
, O
the O
rooms O
empty O
, O
even O
the O
door O
handles O
had O
been O
stolen O
. O

In O
the O
kitchen O
the O
cooking O
pots O
had O
been O
taken O
. O

Maksimenko B-PER
said O
: O
I O
know O
where O
all O
these O
things O
are O
. O

If O
the O
directors O
of O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
would O
come O
we O
could O
get O
them O
back O
. O

When O
I O
came O
back O
a O
second O
time O
I O
found O
9 O
staff O
members O
, O
technical O
and O
medical B-TER
personnel I-TER
: O
they O
decided O
to O
set O
up O
a O
collective O
and O
began O
to O
put O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
in O
order O
. O

I O
found O
them O
working B-TER
with O
rakes O
and O
brooms O
. O

We O
prepared O
a O
lunch B-TER
together O
, O
not O
in O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
, O
but O
at O
the O
home O
of O
a O
friend O
who O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
and O
lived O
nearby O
. O

I O
never O
entered O
the O
sanatorium B-TER
again O
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
17 O
/ O
18th O
October O
, O
I O
continued O
on O
my O
way O
, O
through O
Minsk B-LOC
- I-LOC
Maz.[owiecki I-LOC
] I-LOC
, O
to O
the O
Bug B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

In O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
had O
some O
bread B-TER
. O

There O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
. O

I O
also O
heard O
there O
was O
a O
prisoners B-TER
' O
camp B-TER
there O
, O
with O
many O
Jews O
, O
even O
civilians O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
in O
the O
open O
air O
. O

From O
Minsk B-LOC
I O
left O
for O
Kaluszyn B-LOC
. O

Nothing O
was O
left O
of O
the O
entire O
town O
. O

All O
that O
remained O
was O
bits O
of O
walls O
sticking O
up O
, O
but O
the O
church O
was O
still O
there O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
hidden O
in O
the O
church O
survived O
. O

The O
Poles B-TER
saw O
this O
as O
a O
miracle O
. O

They O
estimated O
the O
number O
of O
dead B-TER
in O
Kaluszyn B-LOC
to O
be O
900 O
, O
most O
of O
them O
Jews O
. O

Everyone O
told O
me O
: O
They O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
destruction O
, O
a O
whole O
town O
wiped O
out O
! O
From O
Kaluszyn B-LOC
I O
went O
to O
Siedlce B-LOC
. O

While O
I O
was O
there O
they O
were O
rounding O
up O
Jews O
in O
the O
street O
for O
work B-TER
details O
. O

A O
large O
part O
of O
Siedlce B-LOC
was O
burned O
down O
. O

We O
were O
able O
to O
get O
bread B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
complained O
that O
the O
Bolsheviks O
had O
retreated O
, O
for O
they O
had O
already O
been O
close O
to O
Siedlce B-LOC
. O

Then O
I O
headed O
for O
Mordy B-LOC
. O

There O
too O
they O
were O
taking O
Jews O
for O
labor B-TER
. O

I O
heard O
about O
Węgrów B-LOC
: O
they O
stabbed B-TER
the O
rabbi B-TER
with O
a O
knife O
. O

Many O
Jews O
were O
assembled O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
opened O
fire O
on O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
threw O
themselves O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
kept O
them O
there O
all O
day O
under O
threat O
of O
being O
shot B-TER
. O

No O
one O
was O
killed B-TER
, O
only O
wounded O
. O

They O
also O
related O
: O
From O
those O
who O
reached O
the O

the O
Germans B-TER
took O
everything O
: O
rings O
, O
furs O
, O
and O
distributed O
it O
all O
to O
the O
Christian O
population O
. O

From O
Mordy B-LOC
I O
went O
to O
the O

, O
using O
back O
roads O
, O
then O
crossed O
the O

with O
a O
small O
boat O
near O
Drohiczyn B-LOC

At O
night O
, O
on O
the O

I O
met O
Soviet B-TER

who O
gave O
me O

The O
attitude O
of O

the O

changed O
considerably O
for O

. O

On O
the O
9th O
[ O
of O
September O

there O
were O
two O
bombings B-TER
: O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
in O
the O

( O

they O
missed O

It O
was O

that O

, O
in O

the O

The O

Local O

, O
afraid O

had O
started O

already O
on O
the O
7th O
[ O

. O

On O
7th O
, O
there O
was O
a O
terrible O

the O

to O

the O

In O
the O
bombardment O

eight O

In O

as O
I O
already O
said O
, O
I O
arrived O

I O
went O
to O
the O
newspaper B-TER
distributor O
Yankev B-PER
Opfal I-PER
. O

The O
writer O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
could O
also O
be O
found O
among O
the O
refugees B-TER
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
who O
were O
stranded O
in O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
he O
was O
extremely O
agitated O
throughout O
. O

He O
constantly O
imagined O
that O
it O
was O
now O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
catch O
him O
. O

His O
panic O
fear O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
originated O
from O
an O
event O
he O
lived O
through O
in O
the O
World O
War B-TER
of O
1914 O
. O

Then O
, O
he O
was O
in O
Kalisz B-LOC
, O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
captured O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
woefully O
- O
famous O
massacre B-TER
of O
Kalisz B-LOC
, O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
shot B-TER
hundreds O
of O
people O
, O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
was O
also O
among O
those O
who O
the O
Germans B-TER
selected O
for O
execution B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
arranged O
a O
group O
of O
people O
and O
picked O
every O
tenth O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
– O
Horontshik B-PER
was O
the O
eleventh O
. O

Due O
to O
his O
great O
agitation O
, O
he O
paralyzed O
at O
once O
. O

He O
lost O
his O
ability O
to O
speak O
. O

Through O
the O
years O
, O
he O
recovered O
, O
but O
all O
along O
there O
remained O
blemish O
– O
a O
constant O
stutter O
. O

The O
memory O
of O
those O
days O
constantly O
tortured B-TER
him O
. O

In O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
, O
on O
Friday O
at O
night O
, O
September O
8 O
, O
1939 O

Horontshik B-PER

Yanovski I-PER
and O
agitatedly O
he O
proclaimed O
: O
Yanovski O
, O
they O
will O
slaughter O
us O
undecipherable O
. O

Yanovski B-PER
tried O
to O
calm O
him O
but O
Horontshik B-PER
immediately O
went O
away O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O

Shabbat O
, O
September O
9 O
, O
at O
noon O
, O
Yanovski B-PER
was O
called O
upon O
to O
identify O
a O
corpse B-TER
that O
was O
laying O
in O
a O
small O
room O
in O
the O
[ O
... O
] O
house O
from O
[ O

] O
. O

Yanovski B-PER
immediately O
identified O
the O
corpse B-TER
to O
be O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
– O
his O
neck O
was O
cut O
with O
a O
razor O
. O

In O
the O
corpse B-TER

pockets O
, O
they O
found O
sixteen O
hundred O

a O
golden O
watch O

and O
a O
written O
testament O
( O
the O

. O

In O
his O
will O
, O
Horontshik B-PER
writes O
that O
he O
got O
fed O
up O
with O
life O
and O
gives O
instructions O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
remaining O
money O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
he O
wanted O
the O
money O
to O
be O
distributed O
as O
follows O
: O
Three O
hundred O
Złoty O
for O
the O
burial B-TER
and O
a O

, O
three O
hundred O
Złoty O
to O
Yiddish O

schools B-TER
; O
three O
hundred O
Złoty O
to O
the O
YIVO B-ORG
; O
and O
the O
rest O
should O
be O
sent O
to O
his O
family B-TER
in O

The O
burial B-TER
took O
place O
on O
Sunday O

, O
at O
the O

Amongst O
others O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
Yanovski B-PER

the O
writer B-TER
Vulman B-PER

present O

I O
myself O
did O
not O
attend O
the O
burial B-TER

Before O
I O
arrived O
in O
Kałuszyn B-LOC

the O
city B-LOC
itself O
had O
not O
suffered O
yet O
. O

The O
city B-LOC
was O
besieged O
by O
refugees B-TER
. O

The O
local O
Jews O
were O
living O
in O
fear O

A O
rumor O
was O
circulating O
that O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
will O
be O
occupied O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
even O
before O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

As O
I O
learned O
later O
on O
, O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
was O
bombarded O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
on O
Monday O
, O
September O
11 O

The O
city B-LOC
was O
completely O

When O
I O
was O
approximately O
half O

at O

a O

Nobody O

there O

I O
spent O
the O

During O
my O
stay O
there O

the O

still O
unscathed O

Only O
later O

I O
learned O

attacked O
with O
incendiary O
bombs O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
a O
second O
time O

out O

) O
We O
arrived O
in O
Likeve B-LOC
already O
after O
German B-TER
airplanes O
had O
bombarded O
the O
city B-LOC

In O
the O
city B-LOC

we O
almost O
only O
encountered O
the O
military B-TER
and O
only O
a O
few O
civilians O
. O

The O
greater O
part O
of O
civilians O
left O
the O

some O
were O
hiding B-TER
somewhere O
. O

The O

were O
open O
– O
there O
were O
no O

Also O
the O
private O
apartments O
were O
abandoned O
. O

Who O
wanted O
could O
take O
whatever O
his O
heart O
desired O

We O
saw O
many O
destroyed O

all O
around O
in O
every O
corner O
( O
street O

were O
not O
recorded O
) O
completely O

We O
came O
across O

were O
buried B-TER

had O
come O
here O

Among O
those O
who O

When O
we O

With O
the O
fire O
, O

was O

thanks O
to O
German B-TER
incendiary O
bombs O
, O
almost O
the O
whole O

disappeared O
, O
in O

the O
Jewish O
part O

All O

went O
up O
in O

There O
were O

Life O
was O

There O
were O

there O
but O
not O
many O
. O

The O
mood O
was O
tensed O
. O

We O
inquired O
whether O
the O
urban B-LOC
administration I-LOC
was O
still O
there O
or O
whether O
it O
had O
already O
left O
. O

( O
Several O
times O
, O
the O
police B-ORG
left O
and O
returned O
to O

Sosnowica B-LOC

a O
small O
shtetele B-LOC

roughly O
sixty O
Jewish O
families B-TER

was O
intact O

The O
shtetl B-LOC
was O
overcrowded O
with O
refugees B-TER
from O
Warsaw B-LOC

In O
Sosnowica B-LOC
, O
I O
rested O
for O
one O
day O
and O
on O
September O
15 O
, O
1939 O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
back O

Warsaw B-LOC

B. O
From O
Sosnowica B-LOC
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
From O
Włodawa B-LOC
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
refugees B-TER
streamed O
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

This O
return O
current O
was O
not O
smaller O
than O
the O
one O
that O
streamed O
to O
Włodawa B-LOC
. O

The O
reason O
of O
the O
stream O
backwards O
was O
that O
in O
Włodawa B-LOC
was O
a O
hunger B-TER
crisis O
and O
high O
prices O
. O

Bread B-TER
costed O
, O
so O
it O
was O
told O

fifteen O

Again O
, O
a O
rumor O
circulated O
that O
generally O
the O
Germans B-TER
do O
not O
have O
armed O
, O
organized O
forces O
in O
Poland B-TER
; O
there O
are O
only O
groups O
of O
divisionary O
agents O
and O
small O
military B-TER
units I-TER
; O
the O
route O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
open O
; O
only O
air O
raids O
are O
a O
great O
concern O
, O
and O
one O
is O
nowhere O
safe O
from O
them O
. O

This O
was O
confirmed O
to O
me O
from O
the O
Polish B-TER
military B-TER
authorities I-TER
and O
they O
advised O
me O
to O
return O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC

and O
cried O
out O
: O
Who O
has O
shoes O
of O
this O
and O
that O
kind O
, O
for O
the O
left O
or O
right O
foot O
. O

Let O
’s O
exchange O
with O
each O
other O
. O

Jews O
were O
afraid O
to O
show O
themselves O
in O
the O
streets O
and O
they O
consequently O
did O
not O
react O
to O
the O
looting B-TER
. O

On O
the O
streets O
, O
there O
was O
no O
police B-ORG
, O
only O
the O
civilian O
militia O
, O
from O
which O
the O
Jews O
had O
been O
immediately O
removed O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

The O
civilian O
militia B-TER
did O
not O
react O
to O
the O
looting B-TER
at O
all O
, O
watching O
it O
indifferently O
. O

There O
was O
not O
one O
case O
when O
Jews O
tried O
to O
rescue O
their O
property O
. O

If O
it O
incidentally O
occurred O
that O
a O
Jew O
went O
by O
, O
they O
did O
not O
beat O
him O
/ O
her O
because O
the O
mob O
was O
too O
busy O
looting B-TER
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
around O
five O
hundred O
stores O
with O
textiles O
, O
shoes O
and O
haberdashery O
have O
been O
entirely O
looted B-TER
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
September O
12 O
, O
around O
noon O
, O
a O
Jewish O
delegation O
, O
led O
by O
Rumkowski B-PER
, O
who O
was O
designated O
as O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
chairman O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
turned O
to O
the O
German B-ORG
military I-ORG
commander I-ORG
. O

( O
There O
was O
also O
Levshteyn B-PER
– O
a O
manufacturer O
– O
and O
a O
third O
one O
whose O
name O
I O
have O
forgotten O
. O

) O
The O
delegation O
requested O
that O
steps O
be O
taken O
so O
that O
the O
looting B-TER
stopps O
. O

The O
commander O
replied O
that O
when O
the O
Jews O
open O
the O
stores O
the O
looting B-TER
will O
stop O
. O

On O
September O
13 O
, O
on O
Wednesday O
the O
eve O
of O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
the O
military B-ORG
headquarters I-ORG
summoned O
the O
rabbis B-TER
Treystman B-PER
and O
Segal B-PER
. O

From O
the O
headquarters B-LOC
, O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
escorted O
them O
in O
an O
open O
car O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
on O
Kastshushka B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

This O
happened O
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
in O
front O
of O
the O
military B-ORG
headquarters I-ORG
a O
car O
pulled O
up O
, O
so O
the O
rabbis B-TER
wanted O
to O
get O
in O
– O
they O
were O
brutally O
pushed O
away O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
got O
in O
the O
car O
. O

On O
the O
step O
on O
one O
side O
, O
the O
old O
sick B-TER
rabbi B-TER
Segal B-PER
was O
standing O
, O
on O
the O
other O
step O
, O
rabbi B-TER
Treystman B-PER
. O

Standing O
like O
this O
, O
they O
were O
driving O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

Everyone O
entered O
the O
synagogue B-TER
– O
the O
escorting O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
and O
the O
rabbis B-TER
, O
no O
one O
else O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
forced O
the O
rabbis B-TER
to O
take O
out O
the O
Torah O
scrolls O
from O
the O
Holy O
Ark O
, O
they O
ordered O
them O
to O
spit O
on O
the O
scrolls O
, O
to O
tread O
on O
them O
with O
their O
feet O
and O
to O
tear O
them O
apart O
. O

The O
rabbis B-TER
refused O
to O
do O
that O
: O
You O
can O
shoot O
us O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
then O
spit O
into O
the O
rabbis B-TER
’ I-TER
faces O
, O
shaved B-TER
off I-TER
the I-TER
rabbis I-TER
’ I-TER
beards I-TER
and O
beat O
them O
with O
their O
fists O
. O

The O
old O
rabbi B-TER
Segal B-PER
fell O
, O
was O
kicked O
and O
muddled O
up O
the O
scrolls O
. O

From O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
the O
rabbis B-TER
were O
escorted O
back O
to O
the O
municipal B-LOC
headquarters I-LOC
. O

There O
, O
they O
received O
the O
orders O
that O
Jews O
are O
forbidden O
to O
pray O
in O
the O
synagogues B-TER
and O
in O
private O
minyans O
Quorum O
of O
ten O
adult O
men O
meeting O
to O
prayer O
. O

on O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
and O
Yom O
Kippur O
. O

Wherever O
Jews O
are O
caught O
praying O
they O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
rabbis B-TER
received O
orders O
that O
the O
Jewish O
stores O
must O
be O
open O
during O
the O
Days O
of O
Awe O
and O
on O
the O
High O
Holidays O
. O

At O
the O
headquarters B-LOC
, O
the O
rabbis B-TER
were O
not O
beaten O
any O
longer O
. O

They O
were O
released O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
community O
published O
a O
printed O
bill O
, O
signed O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
chairman O
Rumkowski B-PER
and O
rabbi B-TER
Treystman B-PER
, O
that O
as O
per O
the O
decree B-TER
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
all O
Jewish O
stores O
have O
to O
be O
open O
, O
Jews O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
pray O
collectively O
, O
Jewish O
stores O
have O
to O
be O
open O
on O
the O
Holidays O
, O
on O
Shabbats O
and O
on O
the O
Days O
of O
Awe O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
Jews O
keep O
their O
stores O
indeed O
open O
and O
do O
not O
pray O
collectively O
. O

As O
per O
the O
promise O
by O
the O
German B-TER
municipal O
commander O
, O
that O
if O
the O
stores O
will O
be O
opened O
, O
the O
looting B-TER
will O
stop O
, O
the O
mass O
robberies B-TER
ended O
, O
but O
in O
different O
streets O
individual O
robbery B-TER
cases O
consistently O
happened O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
already O
by O
a O
larger O
percentage O
of O
German B-ORG
military I-ORG
personnel I-ORG
. O

The O
looting B-TER
was O
primarily O
done O
by O
local O
Germans B-TER
, O
Poles B-TER
in O
comparison O
participated O
not O
so O
much O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
intelligentsia O
were O
deeply O
affected O
by O
Poland B-TER
’s O
destruction O
. O

They O
felt O
for O
the O
Jewish O
population O
but O
did O
not O
actively O
stand O
up O
against O
the O
fraction O
of O
Poles B-TER
who O
took O
part O
in O
the O
mentioned O
robberies B-TER
. O

So O
, O
my O
neighbor O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
a O
judge B-TER
from O
appeal O
court B-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
called O
Kemptshinski B-PER
from O
Galicia B-LOC
, O
expressed O
it O
to O
me O
as O
follows O
: O
the O
fraction O
of O
Polish B-TER
population O
taking O
part O
in O
looting B-TER
is O
an O
expression O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
things O
that O
satisfies O
the O
Germans B-TER
should O
not O
have O
been O
done O
. O

One O
could O
feel O
such O
dejection O
in O
his O
words O
that O
is O
was O
unrealistic O
that O
he O
or O
any O
other O
Polish B-TER
intelligent O
would O
in O
any O
way O
become O
active O
. O

After O
Sukkot O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
turned O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
with O
the O
demand O
that O
20 O
elegantly O
dressed O
Jews O
, O
preferably O
with O
top O
hats O
, O
in O
any O
case O
dressed O
in O
the O
way O
Jews O
dress O
on O
holidays O
for O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
shall O
come O
to O
the O
elegant O
synagogue B-TER
on O
Kashtshushki B-LOC
Avenue I-LOC
. O

The O
headquarters B-LOC
demanded O
that O
they O
shall O
stage O
praying O
in O
participation O
of O
rabbi B-TER
Treystman B-PER
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
gathered O
around O
twenty O
Jews O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
several O
photographs B-TER
of O
the O
praying O
Jews O
. O

As O
it O
is O
understood O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
this O
in O
order O
to O
show O
the O
world O
that O
they O
permit O
Jews O
to O
pray O
. O

Soon O
after O
the O
German B-TER
invaded O
, O
they O
caught O
Jews O
both O
from O
the O
streets O
and O
the O
homes O
. O

They O
were O
forced O
to O
cover O
with O
naked O
hands O
the O
trenches O
which O
had O
been O
digged O
out O
for O
protection O
from O
bombs O
from O
airplanes O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
said O
during O
this O
: O
You O
took O
the O
biggest O
part O
in O
digging O
them O
out O
, O
now O
you O
have O
to O
fix O
what O
you O
have O
damaged O
. O

For O
the O
work B-TER
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
not O
pay O
anything O
. O

There O
were O
cases O
when O
the O
workers B-TER
were O
given O
food B-TER
and O
when O
cigarettes O
were O
distributed O
among O
them O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
started O
to O
intervene O
saying O
Jews O
should O
n’t O
be O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
obligated O
itself O
to O
supply O
700 O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
daily O
on O
the O
condition O
that O
Jews O
are O
no O
longer O
snapped O
from O
the O
streets O
and O
homes O
. O

In O
response O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
gave O
its O
consent O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Jews O
were O
still O
snapped O
from O
the O
streets O
to O
work B-TER
. O

From O
the O
homes O
, O
they O
were O
no O
longer O
dragged O
, O
though O
. O

As O
the O
consequence O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
stopped O
to O
send O
people O
to O
work B-TER
after O
a O
total O
of O
three O
weeks O
. O

For O
a O
Jew O
– O
man B-TER
or O
woman B-TER
– O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
go O
through O
the O
streets O
because O
they O
were O
catching O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
en O
masse O
. O

The O
relation O
to O
the O
caught O
Jews O
was O
better O
in O
the O
beginning O
when O
the O
regime O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
was O
a O
military B-ORG
one O
. O

Since O
October O
8 O
, O
1939 O
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
and O
SA B-ORG
and O
civilian O
local O
Germans B-TER
took O
over O
the O
power O
over O
the O
city B-LOC
( O
the O
Hitlerjugend O
and O
the O
Deutscher O
Selbstschutz O
) O
as O
well O
as O
the O
police B-ORG
, O
which O
was O
made O
up O
of O
local O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
caught O
Jews O
are O
brutally O
beaten O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Clothes O
, O
watches O
, O
cigarette O
- O
boxes O
etc O
. O

is O
robbed B-TER
away O
from O
them O
. O

One O
can O
say O
that O
the O
catching O
for O
work B-TER
has O
become O
a O
system O
in O
order O
to O
pressure O
Jews O
to O
pay O
ransom O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
often O
inventive O
local O
Germans B-TER
but O
also O
officers O
from O
the O
SS O
and O
SA O
took O
part O
in O
robbing B-TER
the O
caught O
Jews O
by O
taking O
ransom O
. O

They O
forced O
the O
Jews O
to O
clean B-TER
toilets O
and O
gutters O
with O
their O
bare O
hands O
, O
to O
clean O
a O
whole O
building O
with O
a O
toothbrush O
. O

Even O
ten O
- O
year O
old O
Jewish O
children B-TER
are O
caught O
for O
work B-TER
. O

a O
ten B-TER

year I-TER
old I-TER
Jewish I-TER
boy I-TER
to O
carry O
a O
big O
suitcase O
. O

The O
boy B-TER
was O
not O
able O
to O
lift O
it O
. O

So O
he O
dragged O
it O
over O
the O
cobblestone O
pavement O
. O

The O
German B-TER
beat O
the O
boy B-TER
mercilessly O
and O
threw O
him O
to O
the O
ground O

And O
while O
screaming O
out O
: O
Dirty O

a O
separate O
room O
. O

) O
I O
was O
beaten O
, O
pushed O
, O
kicked O
. O

Above O
me O
, O
a O
12 B-TER
- I-TER
year I-TER
old I-TER
German B-TER
was O
standing O
in O
a O
uniform O
from O
the O
Hitlerjugend B-ORG
. O

I O
scrubbed O
the O
floors O
standing O
. O

On O
your O
knees O
! O
he O
ordered O
generally O
addressing O
me O
informally O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

I O
pretended O
that O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
him O
. O

So O
he O
pushed O
me O
so O
that O
my O
head O
knocked O
against O
the O
floor O
. O

It O
was O
getting O
dark O
before O
my O
eyes O
and O
I O
was O
working B-TER
this O
way O
from O
9:30am O
to O
1 O
pm O
. O

From O
my O
coat B-TER
, O
which O
stayed O
downstairs O
, O
nothing O
was O
taken O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
this O
happened O
because O
there O
was O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
consulate O
in O
my O
pocket O
. O

When O
I O
exited O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Hitlerjugend O
, O
a O
teenager O
keeping O
watch O
pushed O
me O
. O

On O
my O
way O
back O
home O
, O
there O
is O
an O
assembly O
point O
for O
Germanrefugees O
( O
non O
- O
Jews O
) O
. O

I O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
reach O
my O
home O
as O
I O
was O
dragged O
to O
work B-TER
again O
at O
the O
assembly O
point O
. O

I O
showed O
my O
dirty O
hands O
from O
work B-TER
arguing O
that O
I O
can O
not O
work B-TER
any O
longer O
. O

It O
did O
not O
help O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
Jew O
, O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
mine O
called O
Moler B-PER
, O
a O
57 O
- O
years O
old O
traveling O
salesman O
, O
requested O
to O
let O
me O
go O
. O

Good O
, O
the O
German B-TER
said O
, O
but O
you O
will O
have O
to O
work O
for O
two O
: O
for O
yourself O
and O
for O
her O
. O

And O
so O
it O
was O
: O
Moler B-PER
was O
carrying O
coal O
for O
himself O
, O
and O
for O
me O
, O
he O
was O
scrubbing O
floors O
. O

Such O
work B-TER
was O
not O
necessary O
at O
all O
. O

The O
only O
goal O
was O
to O
torture B-TER
Jews O
and O
to O
make O
fun O
off O
them O
. O

They O
force O
one O
Jew O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
to O
beat O
another O
one O
. O

Or O
after O
work B-TER
, O
for O
example O
, O
they O
arrange O
the O
Jews O
in O
a O
row O
and O
order O
them O
to O
sing O
in O
a O
choir O
: O
We O
Jews O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
war O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
they O
start O
to O
beat O
the O
Jews O
for O
the O
very O
reason O
that O
they O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
war O
. O

They O
also O
force O
Jews O
to O
catch O
other O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
by O
taking O
a O
Jew O
’s O
documents O
and O
threatening O
him O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
if O
he O
does O
not O
deliver O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
Jews O
. O

Generally O
, O
Jews O
are O
treated O
like O
slaves B-TER
. O

The O
following O
cases O
might O
serve O
as O
an O
example O
: O
if O
a O
soldier B-TER
wants O
to O
get O
his O
shoes O
cleaned O
on O
Sundays O
, O
he O
goes O
out O
on O
the O
street O
and O
takes O
a O
Jew O
into O
the O
barracks O
to O
clean O
his O
shoes O
; O
if O
a O
German B-TER
, O
a O
military B-ORG
man I-ORG
or O
civilian O
, O
is O
carrying O
a O
bundle O
on O
the O
street O
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
heavy O
for O
him O
, O
he O
catches O
the O
first O
Jew O
on O
the O
street O
and O
forces O
him O
to O
carry O
the O
bundle O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
following O
scene O
: O
In O
front O
of O
a O
heavy O
truck O
, O
four O
Jews O
were O
harnessed O
instead O
of O
horses O
, O
and O
two O
Jews O
were O
pushing O
the O
wagon O
from O
behind O
. O

A O
German B-TER
was O
beating O
the O
Jews O
with O
whips O
. O

Seared O
into O
every O
German B-TER
’s O
mind O
was O
the O
believe O
that O
the O
Jew O
is O
his O
slave B-TER
. O

Into O
our O
yard O
, O
a O
12- B-TER
to I-TER
13 B-TER
- I-TER
year I-TER
old I-TER
young B-TER
German B-TER
from O
the O
Hitlerjugend O
came O
driving O
on O
a O
bicycle O
. O

On O
the O
yard O
, O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
playing O
whom O
the O
German B-TER
forced O
to O
clean O
his O
bicycle O
. O

And O
the O
young O
German B-TER
said O
: O
You O
, O
Jews O
, O
are O
our O
servants O
. O

Also O
Jewish O
women B-TER
are O
captured O
for O
work B-TER
, O
regardless O
of O
their O
age O
, O
also O
children B-TER
from O
the O
age O
ten O
onwards O
. O

There O
was O
a O
case O
when O
on O
Gdańsk B-LOC
Street I-LOC
90 I-LOC
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
hit O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
and O
broke O
her O
head O
into O
pieces O
. O

This O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
was O
dragged O
to O
work B-TER
, O
was O
over O
sixty O
years O
old O
. O

How O
the O
Germans B-TER
ripped O
away O
the O
trade B-TER
of O
Jews O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
Soon O
, O
two O
- O
three O
weeks O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
occupied B-TER
Łódź B-LOC
, O
they O
issued O
a O
decree B-TER
that O
the O
Jewish O
bakeries O
are O
prohibited O
from O
baking O
bread B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Jews O
were O
standing O
in O
the O
line O
of O
Christian B-TER
bakeries O
, O
they O
were O
pushed O
out O
of O
the O
lines O
. O

Even O
Poles B-TER
were O
pointing O
their O
fingers O
calling O
out O
: O
Jude O
! O
Jude O
! O
4 O
- O
6 O
weeks O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
new O
decrees B-TER
against O
Jews O
started O
pouring O
out O
every O
day O
. O

All O
Jews O
had O
to O
report O
how O
much O
they O
owned O
. O

One O
was O
allowed O
to O
have O
up O
to O
two O
thousand O
Złoty O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
money O
had O
to O
be O
transferred O
to O
a O
blocked O
account O
. O

All O
Jews O
who O
owned O
stores O
, O
warehouses O
, O
factories B-TER
had O
to O
give O
notice O
of O
their O
merchandise O
and O
of O
their O
raw O
material O
and O
to O
seal O
everything O
until O
a O
new O
decree B-TER
[ O
is O
issued O
] O
. O

The O
small O
shops O
were O
automatically O
closed O
down O
this O
way O
. O

The O
bigger O
company O
factories B-TER
and O
warehouses O
were O
occupied O
by O
German B-TER
commissioners O
– O
so O
- O
called O
“ O
depositaries B-TER
. O

” O
The O
whole O
power O
was O
de O
facto O
transferred O
to O
the O
German B-TER
commissioner O
, O
and O
the O
real O
owner O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
mere O
observer O
in O
his O
own O
store O
. O

In O
a O
big O
factory B-TER
or O
store O
, O
the O
owner O
received O
approximately O
200 O
Złoty O
per O
week O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
money O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
blocked O
account O
. O

In O
the O
big O
stores O
, O
one O
was O
allowed O
to O
sell O
merchandise O
to O
military B-ORG
personnel I-ORG
and O
Christians B-TER
. O

To O
Jews O
, O
one O
was O
not O
permitted O
to O
sell O
anything O
. O

In O
this O
transaction O
, O
the O
Jewish O
owner O
only O
took O
on O
the O
role O
of O
an O
observer O
. O

He O
did O
not O
collect O
the O
money O
. O

The O
Jewish O
money O
on O
the O
blocked O
accounts O
was O
put O
into O
different O
banks B-TER
. O

All O
banks B-TER
were O
shut O
down O
except O
for O
two O
German B-TER
banking B-TER
houses I-TER
where O
Jews O
usually O
did O
not O
hold O
their O
capital O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O
Jewish O
wealth O
was O
ruined O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

Coinciding O
with O
the O
large O
scale O
industry O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
also O
destroyed O
Jewish O
small O
industry O
and O
Jewish B-TER
retail I-TER
trading I-TER
. O

On O
Vskhadnye B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
trading B-TER
frank O
and O
free O
with O
bread B-TER
, O
socks O
, O
reforms O
uncertain O
. O

etc O
. O

An O
order O
was O
issued O
saying O
that O
trade B-TER
on O
the O
street O
is O
banned O
. O

Another O
order O
was O
published O
that O
all O
Jewish O
coachmans O
have O
to O
give O
away O
their O
horse O
- O
drawn O
coaches O
together O
with O
the O
horses O
; O
the O
Jews O
in O
return O
received O
a O
receipt O
over O
a O
few O
Mark O
. O

The O
Jewish O
coachman O
and O
driver O
disappeared O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

On O
November O
5 O
, O
1939 O
, O
a O
decree B-TER
was O
issued O
that O
Christian B-TER
stores O
are O
prohibited O
to O
sell O
anything O
to O
Jews O
. O

And O
one O
had O
to O
put O
up O
a O
leaflet O
[ O
saying O
] O
: O
Juden O
Eintritt O
verbotenJews O
entry O
forbidden O
.. O
A O
Jew O
had O
to O
beg O
one O
of O
his O
Christian B-TER
friends O
to O
buy O
shoes O
etc O
. O

for O
him O
. O

Also O
the O
peasants O
, O
who O
come O
to O
the O
city O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
were O
forced O
not O
to O
sell O
anything O
to O
a O
Jew O
. O

The O
peasants O
secretly O
sold O
Jews O
food B-TER
and O
did O
not O
take O
more O
money O
for O
it O
. O

In O
every O
sense O
, O
Jews O
were O
in O
a O
very O
difficult O
situation O
because O
food B-TER
was O
not O
sold O
to O
them O
in O
the O
stores O
cheaper O
and O
they O
were O
being O
chased O
out O
of O
the O
lines O
[ O
in O
front O
of O
the O
stores O
] O
. O

The O
life O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
literally O
paralyzed O
. O

All O
buildings O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
schools I-TER
were O
soon O
occupied O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Jewish O
children B-TER
from O
these O
schools B-TER
studied O
in O
private O
apartments O
in O
3 O
shifts O
– O
from O
9 O
am O
to O
5 O
pm O
. O

The O
Yellow B-TER
Badge I-TER
The O
decree B-TER
regarding O
the O
yellow B-TER
badge I-TER
for O
Jews O
came O
out O
on O
November O
6 O
or O
7 O
, O
1939 O
. O

The O
decree B-TER
says O
that O
Jews O
– O
women B-TER
, O
men O
and O
children B-TER
– O
have O
to O
wear O
the O
yellow B-TER
badge I-TER
. O

On O
strollers O
of O
small O
children B-TER
, O
the O
yellow B-TER
badge I-TER
has O
to O
be O
attached O
. O

Jews O
who O
do O
not O
wear O
the O
yellow B-TER
badge I-TER
get O
the O
death B-TER
penalty O
. O

The O
decree B-TER
had O
a O
dreadful O
effect O
on O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
intelligentsia O
felt O
very O
sorry O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
mob O
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
reacted O
to O
the O
Jews O
with O
their O
yellow B-TER
badges I-TER
with O
a O
mocking O
smile O
on O
their O
faces O
. O

Older O
local O
Germans B-TER
pretended O
that O
they O
do O
not O
see O
the O
yellow B-TER
badge I-TER
. O

The O
younger O
local O
Germans B-TER
reacted O
to O
it O
with O
content O
. O

Jews O
that O
had O
converted O
to O
Christianity B-TER
did O
not O
wear O
any O
badge B-TER
. O

Around O
November O
10 O
, O
a O
decree B-TER
came O
out O
pursuant O
to O
which O
it O
was O
prohibited O
to O
walk O
on O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

Jews O
who O
lived O
on O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
had O
to O
buy O
passing O
permits O
for O
20 O
Złoty O
per O
month O
. O

They O
were O
allowed O
to O
walk O
on O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
only O
until O
11 O
am O
. O

This O
created O
huge O
difficulties O
for O
the O
Jewish O
population O
in O
their O
everyday O
life O
since O
the O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
cuts O
through O
the O
whole O
city O
and O
one O
has O
to O
cross O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
order O
to O
make O
one O
’s O
way O
on O
one O
or O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Jews O
used O
to O
take O
a O
risk O
and O
jumped O
over O
from O
one O
street O
corner O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

This O
always O
ended O
in O
getting O
beaten O
up O
heavily O
and O
even O
in O
getting O
arrested B-TER
because O
on O
all O
street O
corners O
police B-ORG
guards I-ORG
or O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
were O
standing O
. O

To O
this O
day O
, O
the O
prisons B-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
are O
overcrowded O
with O
Jews O
, O
even O
with O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
who O
sinned O
by O
crossing O
Pyetrykover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

To O
this O
day O
, O
no O
one O
of O
the O
detainees O
has O
been O
released O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
intervened O
but O
without O
success O
. O

Around O
November O
13 O
, O
a O
decree B-TER
appeared O
that O
Jews O
are O
allowed O
to O
walk O
[ O
on O
the O
streets O
] O
from O
8 O
am O
to O
5 O
pm O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
used O
to O
turn O
back O
the O
pointer O
on O
their O
watches O
by O
a O
few O
minutes O
or O
, O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
turn O
it O
forward O
and O
they O
arrested B-TER
Jews O
accusing O
them O
of O
being O
on O
the O
street O
too O
early O
or O
of O
walking O
around O
too O
late O
. O

And O
the O
detainees O
have O
not O
been O
released O
to O
this O
day O
. O

Relatives O
of O
the O
detainees O
were O
refused O
any O
information O
and O
were O
told O
to O
leave O
threatening O
them O
that O
they O
will O
arrest O
those O
intervening O
as O
well O
. O

People O
became O
aware O
of O
the O
detainees O
only O
because O
the O
detainees O
, O
who O
receive O
parcels O
from O
outside O
three O
times O
per O
week O
, O
usually O
took O
pains O
to O
get O
out O
slips O
of O
paper O
with O
the O
names O
of O
those O
who O
are O
detained O
with O
the O
receptacles O
. O

Food B-TER
and O
warm O
clothes B-TER
were O
permitted O
. O

Food B-TER

were O
usually O
permitted O
in O
the O
prisons B-TER
on O
Tuesdays O
, O
Thursdays O
and O
Shabbats O
– O
on O
all O
of O
these O
days O
, O
one O
could O
see O
large O
numbers O
of O
Jews O
in O
front O
of O
the O
prisons B-TER
. O

Soon O
, O
in O
the O
first O
days O
, O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
invaded O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
Jews O
started O
to O
be O
kicked O
out O
of O
their O

There O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
prepared O

the O
Baltic O

They O
forced O

because O
the O
Baltic O

The O
looting B-TER
of O
Jewish O
apartments O
started O
in O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
taken O
on O
a O

The O

Allegedly O
, O
they O
were O
searching O

in O

they O
took O
all O
the O
valuable O

For O

in O

Soldiers B-TER

to O
stop O

asking O
how O

they O
had O
threatening O
them O
that O
if O
they O
understate O
the O

it O
will O
be O

The O
soldiers B-TER
used O
to O
take O
all O
of O

they O
found O
with O
the O

of O
their O

From O
the O

The O
Germans B-TER
anticipated O
that O
on O
November O
11 O
, O
the O
21st O
anniversary O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
independence O
, O

break O
out O

In O
order O
to O
scare O
off O
the O
residents O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
the O
following O
: O
very O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
on O
November O
11 O
, O
people O
noticed O
nine O

two O

and O
one O

on O
the O
Bałuty B-LOC
Market I-LOC
The O
faces O
of O
the O
9 O
hanged O
were O
blackened O
, O
smeared O
with O
ream O
so O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
recognize O
who O
it O
is O
. O

The O
whole O
city B-LOC
was O
terrified O
. O

On O
November O
12 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
down O
the O
hanged B-TER
from O
the O
gallows O
. O

On O
the O
11th O
, O
there O
was O
no O
attempt O
of O
rioting O
in O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

The O
hanged B-TER
shook O
the O
city B-LOC
to O
its O
core O
. O

Before O
November O
11 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
blew O
up O
the O
Kashtshushki B-LOC
monument I-LOC
on I-LOC
Liberty I-LOC
Square I-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
only O
took O
Poles B-TER
to O
work B-TER
and O
clean O
up O
the O
rests O
of O
the O
monument O
. O

Amongst O
the O
Poles B-TER
, O
this O
led O
to O
a O
dreadful O
agitation O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
eagerly O
looking O
for O
the O
Bundist B-ORG
Zelmanovitsh B-PER
and O
Filman B-PER

The O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
environs O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
month O
of O
November O
, O
around O
the O
15th O
, O
news O
made O
their O
way O
to O
Łódź B-LOC
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
expulse O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
border O
cities O
and O
from O
the O
cities O
that O
were O
incorporated O
into O
the O
German B-TER
Reich I-TER
. O

The O
first O
city O
from O
where O
Jews O
were O
expelled O
was O
Kalisz B-LOC
. O

The O
expulsion O
from O
Kalisz B-LOC
Thirteen O
thousand O
( O
13.000 O
) O
Jews O
lived O
in O
Kalisz B-LOC
. O

From O
the O
refugees B-TER
from O
Kalisz B-LOC
, O
who O
came O
to O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
we O
learned O
in O
detail O
how O
the O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
carried O
out O
. O

Kalisz B-LOC
Jews O
were O
sitting O
at O
home O
not O
suspecting O
any O
decree B-TER
[ O
to O
be O
issued O
] O
. O

The O
female O
guard O
of O
the O
house O
appeared O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
announced O
that O
they O
should O
gather O
in O
the O
yard O
. O

The O
Jews O
came O
down O
immediately O
as O
they O
were O
dressed O
, O
some O
women B-TER
in O
their O
dressing O
gowns O
. O

One O
quickly O
threw O
over O
a O
coat O
. O

In O
the O
yard O
, O
a O
German B-TER
patrol O
was O
already O
standing O
who O
led O
the O
Jews O
to O
the O
market B-LOC
square I-LOC
. O

He O
did O
not O
allow O
the O
Jews O
to O
go O
back O
up O
home O
and O
to O
take O
something O
with O
them O
. O

This O
was O
the O
way O
it O
happened O
in O
many O
houses O
. O

When O
there O
were O
already O
three O
thousand O
Jews O
on O
the O
market B-LOC
square I-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
chase O
them O
in O
a O
hurry O
and O
with O
bayonets O
. O

They O
chased O
them O
far O
outside O
the O
city O
screaming O
: O
Forward O
because O
we O
are O
shooting O
. O

This O
way O
, O
they O
chased O
them O
for O
approximately O
twenty O
kilometres O
, O
young O
and O
old O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
said O
that O
who O
dares O
and O
comes O
back O
to O
the O
city B-LOC
will O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

All O
apartments O
from O
the O
expelled O
were O
sealed O
. O

All O
of O
this O
went O
on O
for O
three O
days O
in O
a O
row O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
these O
three O
days O
, O
the O
whole O
Jewish O
population O
from O
Kalisz B-LOC
was O
expelled O
. O

The O
Jews O
were O
wandering O
through O
the O
neighboring O
cities O
and O
a O
part O
of O
them O
arrived O
in O
the O
protectorat O
. O

A O
large O
part O
of O
the O
expelled O
from O
Kalisz B-LOC
arrived O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
took O
care O
of O
them O
, O
gave O
them O
food B-TER
, O
but O
one O
can O
not O
speak O
of O
bigger O
help O
because O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
already O
did O
not O
have O
the O
funds O
. O

Poles B-TER
were O
not O
expelled O
from O
Kalisz B-LOC
at O
all O
. O

From O
Konin B-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
expelled O
both O
Poles B-TER
and O
Jews O
and O
afterwards O
from O
all O
cities O
in O
Pomerania B-LOC
, O
Vigdinye O
Uncertain O
. O

, O
Poznań B-LOC
, O
Gdańsk B-LOC
, O
Poyrn O
Uncertain O
. O

, O
Bydgoszcz B-LOC
– O
all O
Jews O
were O
expelled O
from O
there O
and O
also O
Poles B-TER
en O
masse O
. O

I O
also O
learned O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
threatened O
all O
Jews O
from O
Zduńska B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
with O
an O
expulsion O
if O
they O
do O
not O
pay O
a O
contribution O
of O
about O
five O
million O
Złoty O
. O

They O
payed O
a O
part O
of O
the O
contribution O
and O
the O
expulsion O
was O
stopped O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
bigger O
part O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
( O
roughly O
two O
thirds O
) O
was O
expelled O
from O
Pabianice B-LOC
near O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

Jews O
were O
mainly O
chased O
from O
the O
bigger O
streets O
. O

This O
took O
place O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
November O
. O

People O
also O
talked O
about O
that O
there O
will O
be O
an O
expulsion O
of O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
but O
the O
Jews O
consoled O
themselves O
that O
it O
can O
not O
come O
to O
that O
because O
it O
is O
technically O
impossible O
. O

After O
all O
, O
Łódź B-LOC
counts O
a O
quarter O
million O
Jews O
! O
Expulsion O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
On O
December O
11 O
, O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
on O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
there O
is O
a O
placard O
hanging O
in O
Polish B-TER
and O
German B-TER
saying O
that O
Łódź B-LOC
will O
become O
judenrein B-TER
free O
from O
Jews O
and O
that O
the O
Jews O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
voluntarily O
or O
that O
they O
have O
to O
register O
with O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
which O
will O
take O
care O
of O
sending O
them O
off O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

No O
deadline O
was O
indicated O
. O

I O
learned O
that O
Rumkowski B-PER
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
nominated O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
called O
upon O
the O
Jews O
on O
the O
factory B-TER
railway B-LOC
station I-LOC
that O
they O
should O
leave O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

Afterwards O
I O
got O
to O
know O
from O
a O
clerk O
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
how O
it O
came O
to O
that O
. O

A O
day O
earlier O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
informed O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
that O
the O
city O
Łódź B-LOC
has O
to O
become O
judenrein B-TER
and O
that O
they O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
will O
carry O
it O
out O
on O
their O
own O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
started O
to O
request O
that O
it O
should O
get O
the O
possibility O
to O
enforce O
it O
methodically O
, O
not O
en O
masse O
and O
not O
at O
once O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
replied O
that O
they O
will O
do O
a O
test O
: O
if O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
sends O
off O
eight O
thousand O
Jews O
in O
the O
course O
of O
4 O
days O
( O
two O
thousand O
a O
day O
) O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
will O
allow O
that O
everything O
should O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
: O
soon O
, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
began O
to O
work O
energetically O
on O
it O
. O

The O
yard O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
was O
literally O
sieged O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
Jewish O
poor O
registered O
because O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
gave O
50 O
Złoty O
( O
25 O
German B-TER
Mark O
) O
per O
family B-TER
and O
the O
poor O
who O
did O
not O
have O
anything O
were O
eager O
to O
get O
it O
. O

The O
first O
who O
registered O
had O
to O
come O
to O
the O
gathering O
point O
, O
which O
were O
determined O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
– O
and O
from O
there O
, O
they O
were O
sent O
off O
to O
Radogoszcz B-LOC
[ O
prison B-TER
] O
, O
where O
they O
were O
held O
for O
three O
days O
. O

There O
they O
had O
to O
work B-TER
and O
the O
Germans O
also O
carried O
out O
searches O
through O
their O
stuff O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
also O
did O
x O
- O
rays O
in O
order O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
Jews O
had O
not O
swallowed O
any O
diamonds O
. O

One O
was O
allowed O
to O
take O
the O
following O
: O
one O
pair O
of O
underwear O
, O
one O
suit O
of O
clothes O
, O
one O
pair O
of O
shoes O
, O
a O
few O
pairs O
of O
socks O
, O
a O
fork O
, O
spoon O
, O
knife O
, O
one O
pillow O
, O
one O
blanket O
, O
one O
bedsheet O
and O
25 O
Mark O
in O
the O
wallet O
. O

The O
first O
group O
consisted O
of O
five O
hundred O
individuals O
. O

On O
the O
second O
day O
, O
already O
two O
thousand O
five O
hundred O
individuals O
were O
leaving O
, O
and O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
was O
constantly O
sieged O
by O
Jews O
who O
were O
eager O
to O
leave O
the O
earlier O
the O
better O
. O

From O
Radogoszcz B-LOC
, O
the O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
were O
put O
into O
sealed B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
train I-TER
waggons I-TER
and O
sent O
off O
in O
an O
unknown O
direction O
. O

Only O
after O
two O
weeks O
, O
we O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
learned O
about O
their O
fate O
, O
but O
on O
that O
later O
. O

In O
the O
first O
two O
days O
of O
the O
expulsion O
, O
Łódź B-LOC
looked O
like O
in O
the O
most O
horrific O
scene O
in O
a O
film O
. O

On O
all O
streets O
, O
one O
could O
see O
rows O
of O
waggons O
and O
buses O
which O
moved O
slowly O
with O
people O
and O
stuff O
on O
them O
. O

The O
freezing O
weather O
was O
dreadful O
. O

Everyone O
wanted O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
ways O
. O

In O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
there O
are O
two O
train B-LOC
stations I-LOC
. O

The O
Kalisz B-LOC
train B-LOC
station I-LOC
was O
now O
designated O
exclusively O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

So O
, O
for O
Jews O
, O
the O
factory B-TER
train B-LOC
station I-LOC
remained O
. O

There O
, O
scenes O
out O
of O
Dante O
took O
place O
. O

There O
were O
cases O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
shot B-TER
into O
the O
queue O
in O
which O
Jews O
were O
standing O
to O
buy O
tickets O
. O

Three O
Jews O
were O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
in O
situations O
like O
that O
. O

If O
the O
first O
two O
days O
were O
already O
terrifying O
, O
the O
third O
day O
of O
the O
expulsion O
was O
even O
more O
horrible O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
because O
, O
in O
the O
night O
from O
Wednesday O
to O
Thursday O
( O
December O
13 O
, O
1939 O
) O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
surrounded O
a O
few O
streets O
like O
Zgyerzsher B-LOC
, I-LOC
Lushamirsker I-LOC
, O
and O
entered O
the O
Jewish O
apartments O
and O
ordered O
the O
Jews O
to O
leave O
everything O
behind O
within O
five O
minutes O
and O
to O
come O
with O
them O
. O

There O
were O
cases O
when O
mothers B-TER
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
dress O
their O
infants O
properly O
. O

They O
chased O
the O
Jews O
with O
their O
families B-TER
dressed O
as O
they O
were O
to O
the O
train B-LOC
station I-LOC
, O
crammed O
them O
into O
sealed B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
train I-TER
waggons I-TER
and O
sent O
them O
off O
in O
an O
unknown O
direction O
. O

When O
we O
got O
to O
know O
about O
it O
the O
next O
day O
in O
the O
city B-LOC
, I-LOC
a O
terrible O
panic O
erupted O
. O

Through O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
, O
it O
was O
still O
possible O
to O
take O
something O
with O
you O
. O

Those O
who O
got O
displaced O
directly O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
they O
went O
away O
naked O
and O
bare O
. O

The O
rich O
ran O
away O
with O
taxis O
and O
on O
buses O
. O

For O
a O
spot O
on O
a O
bus O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
one O
paid O
from O
500 O
to O
1000 O
Złoty O
. O

The O
poor O
, O
who O
could O
not O
go O
with O
buses O
, O
jump O
on O
waggons O
from O
the O
Warthegau O
( O
the O
part O
that O
was O
annexed O
to O
the O
German B-TER
Reich I-TER
) O
to O
the O
border O
of O
the O
protectorate O
to O
Głowno B-LOC
, O
approximately O
35 O
kilometres O
away O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

Without O
any O
means O
and O
possibilities O
to O
go O
on O
, O
they O
were O
stuck O
there O
. O

There O
were O
probably O
around O
eight O
thousand O
Jews O
there O
. O

Since O
Głowno B-LOC
is O
a O
small O
shtetl O
, O
and O
there O
was O
nowhere O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
, O
the O
expelled O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
lingered O
on O
the O
fields O
and O
in O
the O
forests O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
. O

The O
consequences O
were O
catastrophic O
: O
in O
the O
course O
of O
one O
night O
, O
400 O
children B-TER
froze O
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
relationship O
from O
the O
Polish B-TER
peasants O
to O
the O
Jewish O
expellees O
was O
a O
good O
one O
. O

They O
took O
the O
Jews O
in O
into O
cottages O
and O
gave O
them O
food O
for O
free O
. O

But O
the O
stream O
[ O
of O
refugees B-TER
] O
was O
so O
big O
that O
the O
peasants O
’ O
help O
did O
not O
suffice O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
was O
so O
helpless O
that O
it O
did O
not O
send O
anyone O
to O
Głowno B-LOC
. O

On O
Friday O
, O
December O
15 O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
rich O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
gathered O
on O
Bałut B-LOC
Market I-LOC
– O
in O
the O
true O
Jewish O
center O
– O
and O
shouted O
: O
Jews O
, O
take O
money O
and O
jewelry O
. O

And O
they O
simply O
threw O
diamonds O
on O
the O
street O
. O

The O
Jews O
did O
not O
take O
it O
, O
though O
, O
because O
they O
said O
to O
the O
rich O
: O
The O
same O
danger O
that O
threatens O
you O
threatens O
us O
. O

A O
Jew O
is O
prohibited O
to O
have O
on O
him O
jewelry O
and O
money O
, O
and O
they O
did O
not O
take O
the O
money O
and O
jewelry O
. O

In O
the O
night O
from O
Friday O
to O
Shabbat O
( O
from O
the O
15th O
to O
the O
16th O
) O
, O
mass O
arrests B-TER
among O
the O
intelligentsia O
began O
, O
among O
doctors B-TER
, O
lawyers O
, O
teachers O
– O
both O
Jews O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
. O

People O
were O
thinking O
that O
these O
were O
arrests B-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
was O
an O
expulsion O
. O

Within O
five O
minutes O
, O
all O
families B-TER
from O
these O
detainees O
were O
sent O
off O
in O
sealed B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
train I-TER
cars I-TER
. O

When O
, O
by O
coincidence O
, O
there O
was O
a O
stranger O
in O
the O
home O
of O
such O
an O
intelligent O
, O
a O
stranger O
who O
does O
not O
belong O
to O
that O
category O
, O
they O
sent O
him O
off O
as O
well O
. O

There O
were O
eight O
cases O
when O
people O
were O
severely O
ill B-TER
and O
they O
could O
not O
be O
sent O
off O
– O
so O
the O
Germans B-TER
sealed O
up O
the O
apartments O
. O

The O
ones O
sealed O
- O
up O
remained O
confined O
like O
that O
for O
ten O
days O
. O

The O
neighbors O
heard O
the O
cries O
from O
the O
wretched O
ones O
. O

One O
froze O
from O
the O
cold O
, O
also O
the O
pipes O
from O
the O
water O
conduit O
froze O
so O
that O
there O
was O
no O
water O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
constantly O
intervened O
at O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
but O
without O
success O
. O

Only O
on O
the O
tenth O
day O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
permitted O
to O
open O
the O
sealed O
- O
up O
apartments O
: O
in O
these O
apartments O
, O
one O
found O
two O
dead O
persons O
and O
the O
rest O
was O
unconscious O
and O
in O
terrible O
conditions O
. O

The O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Jews O
as O
well O
as O
the O
mass O
exodus O
lasted O
until O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
December O
17 O
, O
1939 O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
news O
circulated O
fast O
as O
lightning O
across O
the O
city O
that O
the O
expulsion O
was O
stopped O
. O

I O
soon O
went O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
and O
they O
told O
me O
that O
on O
Shabbat O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
at O
four O
o’clock O
, O
a O
delegation O
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
, O
namely O
Rumkowski B-PER
’s O
representative O
Dr. O
Helman B-PER
, O
the O
female O
lawyer O
Plivatska B-PER
and O
a O
third O
person O
, O
went O
to O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
city O
with O
the O
request O
that O
they O
should O
alleviate O
the O
expulsion O
. O

The O
Jewish O
delegation O
listed O
all O
the O
horror O
and O
consequences O
of O
the O
expulsion O
. O

The O
Jewish O
delegation O
was O
received O
by O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
city O
in O
the O
corridor O
and O
with O
a O
strict O
tone O
he O
said O
: O
The O
Jews O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
en O
masse O
. O

Łódź O
has O
to O
become O
judenrein O
! O
If O
the O
number O
of O
Jews O
who O
will O
leave O
Łódź O
will O
be O
satisfying O
, O
the O
Germans O
wo O
n’t O
be O
dragging O
Jews O
from O
their O
apartments O
. O

With O
this O
, O
the O
Jewish O
delegation O
left O
thinking O
that O
their O
intervention O
did O
not O
lead O
to O
anything O
. O

Around O
midnight O
on O
Shabbat O
, O
there O
was O
a O
telephone O
call O
for O
Rumkowski B-PER
’s O
representative O
Dr. O
Helman B-PER
. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
call O
was O
: O
Please O
tell O
the O
Jews O
that O
they O
should O
not O
leave O
Łódź O
. O

Dr. O
Helman B-PER
began O
to O
ask O
for O
how O
long O
the O
expulsion O
will O
be O
halted O
but O
he O
did O
n’t O
receive O
any O
reply O
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
the O
city B-LOC
learned O
about O
it O
and O
different O
rumors O
started O
to O
circulate O
. O

They O
said O
that O
it O
is O
temporary O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
freezing O
weather O
holds O
sway O
. O

Also O
that O
the O
expulsion O
is O
halted O
until O
March O
1 O
. O

Others O
said O
that O
it O
was O
an O
intervention O
from O
America O
which O
threatened O
that O
it O
will O
expel O
the O
Germans B-TER
from O
there O
on O
ships O
; O
others O
assured O
that O
it O
happened O
because O
it O
was O
technically O
impossible O
to O
send O
off O
such O
a O
big O
number O
of O
individuals O
because O
all O
paths O
were O
clogged O
up O
by O
the O
coaches O
and O
buses O
. O

The O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
felt O
relieved O
. O

We O
kissed O
each O
other O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
wished O
mazl O
- O
tov O
. O

But O
nonetheless O
, O
the O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
continued O
to O
leave O
the O
city B-LOC
in O
great O
numbers O
. O

The O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O
expulsion O
has O
been O
called O
off O
for O
good O
. O

They O
think O
that O
the O
halt O
of O
the O
expulsion O
is O
temporary O
because O
the O
official O
German B-TER
offices O
have O
not O
given O
any O
formal O
announcement O
. O

The O
panic O
to O
escape O
was O
not O
as O
frenzied O
as O
before O
but O
people O
still O
left O
the O
city B-LOC
en O
masse O
. O

The O
nervousness O
amongst O
the O
Jews O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
which O
has O
decreased O
a O
little O
was O
renewed O
again O
ten O
days O
later O
when O
we O
learned O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
expel O
the O
Jews O
from O
neighboring O
cities O
like O
Pabianice B-LOC
, O
Aleksandrów B-LOC
( I-LOC
Łódzki I-LOC
) I-LOC
, O
Konstantynów B-LOC
( I-LOC
Łódzki I-LOC

, O
Zg B-LOC
ierz B-LOC
and O
other O
shtetlekh O
surrounding O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

The O
Jews O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
once O
again O
had O
a O
nervous O
night O
[ O
leyl O
- O
shimurim O
= O
holiday O
eve O
, O
esp O
. O

the O
first O
night O
of O
Passover O
] O
. O

We O
were O
anxious O
. O

We O
were O
afraid O
that O
the O
expulsion O
would O
start O
anew O
because O
the O
roads O
were O
emptier O
again O
. O

On O
Shabbat O
, O
December O
30 O
, O
1939 O
, O
I O
drove O
out O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
and O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
anything O
about O
the O
subsequent O
fate O
of O
the O
people O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

Regarding O
the O
expelled O
Jews O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
to O
Głowno B-LOC
, O
I O
learned O
that O
only O
later O
– O
after O
two O
weeks O
after O
the O
expulsion O
– O
the O
Germans B-TER
sent O
the O
expelled O
Jews O
to O
Galicia B-LOC
, O
in O
small O
shtetlekh O
, O
in O
barracks O
à O
1000 O
individuals O
, O
on O
stony O
floors O
. O

From O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
circle O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
I O
got O
to O
know O
things O
that O
were O
not O
known O
in O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
namely O
: O
that O
the O
arrested B-TER
Jews O
were O
tortured B-TER
; O
they O
pulled O
out O
of O
their O
mouths O
golden O
teeth O
and O
crowns O
and O
there O
were O
also O
cases O
of O
castration O
. O

I O
learned O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
also O
expelled O
the O
Jews O
from O
Żychlin B-LOC
, O
which O
belongs O
to O
the O
protectorate O
, O
in O
the O
same O
way O
they O
did O
in O
Kalisz B-LOC
. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
let O
packs O
of O
dogs O
chase O
after O
the O
Jews O

On O

4 O
or O
5 O
, O
1939 O
, O
the O
Russians B-TER
left O
Suwałki B-LOC
. O

Before O
they O
left O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
they O
ceremonially O
transferred O
the O
city B-LOC
to O
the O
delegates O
of O
the O
German B-TER
army B-TER
on O
Magistrate B-LOC
Square I-LOC
. O

Thereafter O
, O
bigger O
German B-TER
army B-TER
detachments O
entered O
Suwałki B-LOC
. O

The O
initial O
two O
- O
three O
days O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
behaved O
calmly O
and O
did O
not O
bother O
anyone O
. O

They O
only O
issued O
decrees B-TER
that O
when O
Jews O
encounter O
a O
German B-TER
soldier O
on O
the O
street O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
down O
from O
the O
sidewalk O
and O
take O
their O
hats O
off O
. O

Simultaneously O
, O
they O
decreed B-TER
for O
all O
shops O
to O
open O
. O

The O
residents O
immediately O
opened O
the O
stores O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
went O
into O
each O
Jewish O
shop O
, O
took O
the O
cash O
from O
the O
check O
- O
outs O
, O
expelled O
the O
owners O
and O
locked O
the O
stores O
after O
having O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
keys O
. O

They O
did O
not O
touch O
the O
Christian B-TER
stores O
. O

My O
cousin B-TER
Genye B-PER
Viner I-PER
owned O
a O
rather O
big O
haberdashery O
store O
on O
Kashtshyushka B-LOC
Street I-LOC
10 I-LOC
( O
now O
General O
Bransch O
- O

) O
. O

Her O
husband B-TER
enlisted O
to O
the O
Polish B-TER
army B-TER
and O
was O
killed B-TER
near O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

And O
she O
remained O
a O
widow O
with O
two O
small O
children B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
entered O
also O
her O
store O
, O
just O
as O
they O
did O
with O
the O
others O
, O
took O
from O
the O
check O
- O
out O
counter O
several O
thousand O
Złoty O
as O
well O
as O
all O
her O
merchandise O
. O

My O
cousin B-TER
went O
to O
the O
German B-TER
captain O
and O
requested O
to O
at O
least O
return O
the O
cash O
to O
her O
since O
she O
was O
a O
miserable O
widow O
with O
two O
orphans B-TER
. O

The O
captain O
wanted O
to O
pay O
her O
back O
thirty O
Złoty O
. O

And O
when O
she O
started O
crying O
claiming O
that O
she O
wo O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
do O
anything O
with O
such O
a O
small O
sum O
, O
he O
cynically O
replied O
: O
You O
can O
buy O
a O
rope O
with O
the O
money O
and O
hang O
yourself O
. O

I O
myself O
had O
a O
store O
for O
candy B-TER
, O
fruits B-TER
and O
wine O
in O
my O
house O
. O

The O
first O
days O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
not O
bother O
me O
thinking O
that O
mine O
was O
a O
Christian B-TER
store O
. O

Later O
, O
though O
, O
they O
came O
into O
my O
store O
and O
took O
away O
all O
my O
merchandise O
. O

They O
also O
conducted O
a O
search O
in O
my O
home O
looking O
for O
gold O
and O
merchandise O
. O

Soon O
after O
their O
arrival O
in O
the O
city O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
imposed O
taxes O
on O
Jewish O
homeowners O
. O

From O
myself O
they O
demanded O
20 O
thousand O
Mark O
, O
to O
which O
I O
in O
turn O
gave O
an O
advance O
of O
800 O
Guilds O
. O

Whole O
days O
, O
the O
Jews O
remained O
locked O
in O
in O
their O
apartment O
because O
they O
were O
snatched O
up O
for O
the O
dirtiest O
kind O
of O
work B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
spare O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
also O
started O
to O
go O
to O
the O
homes O
of O
the O
rich O
Jews O
and O
robbed B-TER
everything O
they O
could O
. O

Many O
Jews O
, O
unable O
to O
take O
it O
any O
longer O
, O
began O
to O
flee O
to O
the O
Soviet B-TER
territories O
. O

In O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
month O
December O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
suddenly O
issued O
a O
decree B-TER
that O
the O
Jews O
should O
store O
up O
food B-TER
for O
three O
days O
. O

In O
the O
city O
, O
there O
was O
a O
turmoil O
. O

One O
did O
not O
know O
what O
this O
meant O
. O

I O
went O
into O
the O
city O
in O
order O
to O
go O
shopping O
but O
on O
the O
way O
I O
noticed O
how O
the O
German B-TER
police O
led O
Jews O
, O
Jewish O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

The O
turmoil O
got O
even O
bigger O
. O

People O
started O
saying O
that O
all O
Jews O
will O
be O
expelled O
from O
the O
city B-LOC
and O
sent O
away O
to O
the O
Lublin B-LOC
Reservation I-LOC
. O

I O
immediately O
returned O
home O
and O
started O
preparing O
myself O
and O
the O
children B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
. O

Soon O
, O
the O
Christian B-TER
woman B-TER
from O
next O
door O
came O
running O
to O
me O
and O
said O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
are O
already O
coming O
for O
me O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
escape O
with O
my O
children B-TER
from O
the O
apartment O
through O
the O
backdoor O
and O
hid B-TER
in O
the O
basement O
. O

Not O
everyone O
was O
as O
lucky O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
Jews O
with O
their O
families B-TER
were O
chased O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
courtyard I-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
did O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
take O
any O
baggage O
– O
hitting O
the O
old O
and O
weak O
with O
whips O
if O
they O
were O
not O
able O
to O
walk O
fast O
enough O
. O

I O
was O
laying O
with O
my O
children B-TER
in O
the O
basement O
until O
3 O
am O
when O
an O
acquainted O
Christian B-TER
led O
me O
out O
. O

I O
did O
not O
go O
back O
into O
my O
apartment O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
had O
looted B-TER
it O
entirely O
in O
the O
interim O
and O
sealed O
the O
doors O
afterwards O
. O

On O
circuitous O
routes O
, O
I O
, O
together O
with O
my O
children B-TER
, O
ran O
away O
and O
we O
met O
many O
acquaintances O
on O
our O
way O
who O
had O
also O
succeeded O
in B-TER
hiding I-TER
from O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
a O
village O
located O
four O
kilometres O
outside O
of O
Suwałki B-LOC
and O
there O
we O
hid B-TER
for O
2 O
days O
. O

In O
the O
village O
, O
we O
later O
got O
a O
ride O
and O
drove O
to O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
border B-TER
to O
the O
village O
Madani B-LOC
uncertain O
. O

We O
drove O
for O
2 O
days O
because O
driving O
was O
only O
possible O
at O
night O
. O

In O
the O
daytime O
, O
German B-TER
patrols O
stopped O
[ O
everyone O
] O
and O
sent O
them O
back O
to O
Suwałki B-LOC
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
we O
were O
50 O
individuals O
at O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
border B-TER
. O

From O
the O
remaining O
Suwałki B-LOC
Jews O
– O
around O
3 O
thousand O
persons O
were O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
Germans B-TER

sent O
off O

the O

10 O
individuals O
saved O
themselves O
on O
the O
last O
day O
by O
running O
to O
the O
Soviet B-TER

2 O

We O
, O
on O
the O

committed B-TER

from O
her O

Also O
the O
dentist O
Shtern B-PER
from O
Suwałki B-LOC
went O
insane O

At O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
border B-TER
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
arrested B-TER
me O
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
they O
took O
all O
the O
money O
that O
I O
had O
and O
then O
sent O
us O
back O
to O
Suwałki B-LOC

Coming O
to O
Suwałki B-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
wanted O
to O
send O
me O
off O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

But O
after O
much O
supplicating O
and O
pleading O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
me O
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
back O
to O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
border B-TER
, I-TER
and O
this O
time O
I O
made O
it O
to O

Being O
in O
Suwałki B-LOC
for O
the O
second O
time O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
there O
were O
still O
60 O
arrested B-TER
Jews O
sitting O

about O
the O
mass B-TER

of O
Jews O
in O
Ostrów B-LOC

On O

We O
ourselves O

to O
the O

the O

Yosl B-PER
Modrykamyen I-PER

who O

Yosl B-PER
Modrykamyen I-PER

died B-TER
as O
well O

Only O
his O
daughter B-TER
was O
able O
to O
save O
herself O
. O

We O
also O
talked O
with O
a O
Jew O
, O
who O
was O
in O
Ostrów B-LOC
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
massacre B-TER
and O
survived O
owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
wearing O
a O
Christian B-TER
[ O
peaked O
] O
cap O
, O
a O
matsheyuvke O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
cap O
with O
a O
visor O
and O
he O
was O
shaved O
and O
generally O
looked O
like O
a O
Christian B-TER
. O

They O
both O
related O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
themselves O
placarded O
posters O
on O
the O
streets O
announcing O
that O
the O
Jews O
of O
Ostrów B-LOC
died B-TER
in O
accordance O
with O
a O
verdict O
of O
a O
German B-TER
court B-TER
. O

The O
calamity O
happened O
under O
the O
following O
circumstances O
: O
One O
side O
of O
Rinek B-LOC
caught O
fire O
( O
Rinek B-LOC
the O
street O

called O
where O
once O
there O
was O
a O

; O
officially O
: O
Square O
of O
the O
Duchess O

. O

Only O
Jewish O
houses O
are O
located O
there O
like O
the O
house O
of O
Teytel B-PER
, O
Likhtnshteyn B-PER
, O
Kronenberg B-PER
, O
Bromberg B-PER
and O
of O
others O
. O

There O
were O
stores O
for O
textiles O

haberdasheries O
, O
groceries O
and O
also O
a O
candy O
store O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
the O
main O
street O
. O

We O
presume O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
themselves O
set O
the O
houses O
on O
fire O
. O

The O
houses O
burnt O
a O
whole O
night O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
later O
implied O
that O
the O
Jews O
set O
the O
fire O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
promised O
the O
Poles B-TER
25 O
Złoty O
per O
head O
when O
they O
turn O
over O
Jews O
, O
and O
the O
Poles B-TER
constantly O
dragged O
Jews O
to O
the O
city B-LOC
hall I-LOC
where O
the O
German B-TER
police B-TER
station O
was O
located O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
mob O
together O
with O
the O
Germans B-TER
dragged O
the O
Jews O
out O
of O
the O
houses O
. O

Everyone O
was O
dragged O
out O
, O
also O
old O
people O
, O
women B-TER
, O
and O
children B-TER

From O
the O
city B-LOC

the O
Jews O
were O
led O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
Road I-LOC
, O
after O
Starastve B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
near O
the O
woods O
of O
the O
former O
Polish B-TER
commander O
where O
once O
there O
was O
a O
summer O
house O
. O

This O
is O
located O
one O
and O
a O
half O
kilometres O
away O
from O
Ostrów B-LOC
Mazowiecka I-LOC

There O
, O
561 O
Jews O
were O
gathered O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
the O
Jews O
to O
dig O
out O
pits B-TER
. O

And O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
lay O
themselves O
into O
the O
pits B-TER
. O

Parents O
had O
to O
throw O
their O
own O
children B-TER
into O
the O
pits B-TER
, O
and O
with O
rifles O
and O
revolvers O
all O

were O
shot B-TER

were O
caught O
after O
the O
execution B-TER
[ O

were O
led O

as O
well O
as O
into O
the O
ice O

of O
the O

of O
the O

. O

Since O
Ostrów B-LOC
is O
less O
than O
2 O
kilometres O
away O
from O
the O
Soviet B-TER

, O
the O
majority O

ran O
away O
to O
the O
Russian B-TER
side O
. O

Roughly O
15 O

In O

not O

We O

The O
Polish B-TER

starved B-TER

such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
were O
unable O

stand O

They O
told O

that O
they O
have O
n’t O
had O
anything O

three O
days O

The O
Germans B-TER

Friday O
morning O

Most O

At O

They O
even O
started O

to O
take O
out O
men O
from O

I O
went O

my O
mother B-TER
saved O

by O
telling O
the O

But O
a O

They O
wanted O
to O
simply O
pierce O
myself O

In O

On O

Around O

, O
they O
made O

Due O

the O

We O

doused O
him O

In O

the O
Germans B-TER
permitted O

The O
Germans B-TER
ordered O

Every O
time O
they O
ordered O
one O
Jew O

carry O
a O
beam O
so O
big O
that O
it O
would O
normally O
have O
to O
be O
carried O

In O

When O
someone O

he O
was O
beaten O
with O

. O

Many O
prisoners B-TER
were O
wounded O

The O
Jews O
were O
walking O
barefoot O
because O
the O
Poles B-TER
had O
already O
taken O
everything O
from O
them O
– O
even O
the O
shoes O

Many O
of O

there O
were O
also O
many O
refugees B-TER
from O
Różan B-LOC
and O
other O
surrounding O

. O

In O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
we O
spent O
3 O
weeks O
– O
from O
Sunday O
, O
September O
10 O
, O
until O
Shabbat O
Chol O
- O
Hamoed O

on O
the O

days O
during O
Sukkot O

( O
September O
30 O
) O
. O

During O
the O
whole O
time O
, O
we O
were O
tortured B-TER
indescribably O
. O

Roll O
calls O
were O
called O
upon O
ten O
times O
per O
day O
and O
every O
time O
they O
would O
take O
photographs B-TER
of O
those O
with O
beards O
, O
dusty O
Probably O
meant O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
backward O
and O
poor O
. O

Jews O
, O
the O
shabby O
suffering O
victims B-TER
. O

When O
exiting O
the O
barracks O
after O
having O
crumbs O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
they O
would O
very O
often O
entertain O
themselves O
with O
us O
, O
chasing O
us O
, O
beating O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
they O
used O
to O
take O
the O
crowd O
to O
work B-TER
. O

They O
treated O
the O
Poles B-TER
not O
much O
better O
than O
us O
but O
they O
usually O
did O
not O
torture B-TER
them O
. O

Every O
barrack O
had O
its O
very O
own O
commander O
from O
among O
the O
internees O
proper O
. O

With O
us O
there O
was O
a O
Jew O
from O
Stawiski B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
responsible O
for O
keeping O
the O
order O
in O
the O
barrack O
. O

He O
also O
had O
to O
mediate O
between O
us O
and O
the O
camp B-LOC
commander O
’s O
office O
. O

But O
as O
long O
as O
the O
young O
soldiers B-TER
kept O
watch O
over O
us O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
miserable O
like O
death O
. O

We O
used O
to O
complain O
via O
our O
commander O
, O
that O
we O
are O
robbed B-TER
of O
everything O
, O
but O
that O
did O
not O
help O
at O
all O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
literally O
barefoot O
and O
in O
underwear O
. O

The O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
adjacent O
32nd O
barrack O
, O
as O
mentioned O
before O
, O
took O
away O
all O
our O
clothes B-TER
, O
the O
shoes O
and O
even O
the O
paillasses O
. O

We O
started O
to O
cut O
the O
remaining O
paillasses O
into O
bast O
shoes O
which O
we O
used O
to O
wrap O
around O
our O
naked O
feet O
. O

We O
were O
also O
wearing O
paillasses O
as O
clothes O
. O

One O
week O
after O
our O
arrival O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
they O
changed O
our O
guards O
. O

Other O
Germans B-TER
arrived O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
– O
older O
and O
demure O
ones O
who O
treated O
us O
a O
little O
more O
humane O
. O

The O
main O
accomplishment O
of O
the O
new O
guards O
was O
that O
they O
summoned O
the O
bandits O
of O
the O
adjacent O
32nd O
barrack O
to O
give O
back O
the O
looted B-TER
things I-TER
. O

A O
part O
of O
the O
clothes B-TER
were O
indeed O
returned O
to O
us O
: O
jackets B-TER
, O
sweaters B-TER
, O
shoes B-TER
etc O
. O

Whoever O
did O
not O
return O
the O
things O
on O
his O
own O
was O
forced O
by O
the O
guards O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
. O

If O
someone O
pointed O
out O
that O
somebody O
was O
wearing O
robbed B-TER
clothes O
, O
the O
commander O
used O
to O
stop O
this O
person O
immediately O
and O
to O
take O
off O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
him O
. O

The O
strongest O
boys O
of O
the O
32nd O
barrack O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
resist O
this O
time O
. O

Incited O
to O
loot B-TER
by O
the O
young O
Hitlerites B-TER
, O
they O
were O
now O
forced O
by O
the O
old O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
to O
return O
the O
little O
clothes B-TER
they O
had O
robbed B-TER
. O

Irrespective O
of O
that O
, O
we O
were O
dirty O
and O
full O
of O
lice O
because O
we O
were O
not O
provided O
with O
a O
bath O
. O

And O
the O
shirts B-TER
we O
were O
wearing O
for O
5 O
weeks O
straight O
. O

On O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
they O
started O
to O
compile O
lists O
of O
boys O
under O
17 O
and O
older O
men O
over O
45 O
. O

Doctors B-TER
were O
also O
coming O
, O
and O
inspected O
those O
persons O
who O
indicated O
that O
they O
are O
sick B-TER
. O

Of O
the O
weak O
and O
sick B-TER
special O
lists O
were O
compiled O
. O

The O
preparation O
of O
the O
lists O
took O
until O
Yom O
Kippur O
. O

Between O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
and O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
Polish B-TER
police B-ORG
, O
train O
officials O
, O
officers O
etc O
. O

arrived O
in O
camp B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
Days O
of O
Awe O
, O
we O
almost O
did O
not O
pray O
at O
all O
. O

On O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
we O
got O
up O
to O
pray O
at O
6 O
am O
but O
until O
we O
got O
to O
shakhres O
Morning O
prayer O
. O

we O
were O
taken O
aside O
for O
a O
roll O
call O
. O

On O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
our O
laments O
were O
immense O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
to O
work B-TER
that O
day O
. O

A O
few O
Germans B-TER
came O
to O
us O
into O
the O
barrack O
to O
hear O
us O
pray O
. O

They O
did O
not O
ridicule O
us O
. O

Approximately O
30 O
secular O
Jews O
volunteered O
to O
work B-TER
in O
order O
to O
free O
up O
from O
work B-TER
those O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

After O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
they O
started O
to O
send O
Poles B-TER
en O
masse O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
were O
first O
bathed O
and O
then O
send O
away O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
any O
cigarettes O
, O
and O
soon O
a O
tobacco O
trade B-TER
developed O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
. O

Individuals O
who O
had O
money O
were O
secretly O
buying O
tobacco O
from O
the O
guard O
and O
making O
cigarettes O
. O

For O
one O
cigarette O
, O
one O
had O
to O
pay O
2 O
Złoty O
. O

Only O
later O
, O
it O
started O
to O
get O
cheaper O
and O
it O
dropped O
to O
30 O
grosz O
. O

After O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
they O
gathered O
the O
Jews O
and O
special O
speakers O
were O
giving O
speeches O
for O
us O
that O
we O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
Russian O
– O
the O
Germans B-TER
do O
not O
want O
to O
have O
us O
. O

To O
the O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
territories O
that O
were O
occupied O
by O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
speeches O
were O
given O
that O
, O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
go O
home O
, O
they O
would O
be O
released O
– O
but O
those O
who O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Germany B-TER
could O
stay O
and O
work O
for O
4 O
Mark O
a O
day O
. O

The O
majority O
wanted O
to O
return O
home O
, O
however O
. O

2 O
peasants O
escaped O
from O
everything O
on O
their O
own O
, O
but O
they O
were O
caught O
and O
shot B-TER
. O

They O
were O
buried B-TER
together O
with O
the O
young O
man O
Reytshik B-PER
from O
Różan B-LOC
, O
who O
died B-TER
of O
too O
much O
food B-TER
. O

The O
story O
with O
him O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
Once O
a O
landowner O
from O
Tannenberg B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Olsztynek I-LOC
] I-LOC
entered O
the O
camp B-LOC
and O
took O
around O
one O
hundred O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
for O
him O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
he O
took O
workers B-TER
again O
. O

This O
repeated O
itself O
several O
times O
. O

There O
were O
also O
several O
times O
when O
they O
took O
Jews O
. O

Later O
they O
stopped O
taking O
Jews O
. O

The O
returnees O
from O
work B-TER
used O
to O
feel O
happy O
because O
the O
landowner O
used O
to O
give O
them O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TER
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
Reytshik B-PER
overate B-TER
himself O
and O
his O
intestines O
turned O
. O

The O
last O
week O
of O
our O
time O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
they O
brought O
to O
us O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
several O
hundred O
Jewish O
soldiers B-TER
from O
the O
Polish B-TER
army B-TER
. O

They O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
special O
barrack O
. O

On O
Thursday O
, O
28 O
September O
, O
they O
started O
to O

from O
all O
interned O
Jews O
and O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
territories O
, O
which O
were O
occupied O
by O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
, O
that O
we O
reject O
the O
right O
to O
German B-TER
citizenship B-TER
and O
that O

mentioned O

On O

. O

On O

So O

On O

. O

They O
told O
me O
that O
on O
the O
morning O
after O
we O
were O
led O
out O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
started O
to O
shoot O
into O
the O
houses O
and O
after O
that O
they O
set O
the O
city O
on O
fire O
with O
grenades O
. O

Then O
, O
approximately O
80 O
Jews B-TER
died I-TER
. O

Close O
to O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
were O
chased O
by O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
into O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
set O
them O
on O
fire O
but O
some O
officer O
rescued O
the O
Jews O
. O

Since O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
was O
already O
packed O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
standing O
outside O
, O
but O
the O
soldiers B-TER
were O
shooting O
at O
them O
with O
rifles O
and O
many O
Jews B-TER
died I-TER
this O
way O
. O

After O
rescuing O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
from O
certain O
death B-TER
, O
the O
young O
people O
were O
chased O
to O
Hohenstein B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Olsztynek I-LOC
] I-LOC
where O
I O
was O
at O
, O
and O
all O
remaining O
people O
– O
including O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
( O
even O
infants B-TER
) O
– O
were O
held O
on O
a O
field O
. O

They O
ate B-TER
beets B-TER
, O
[ O
unclear O
] O
etc O
. O

The O
elder O
Jews O
, O
who O
were O
sent O
home O
– O
as O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
– O
from O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
road O
soon O
after O
our O
arrest B-TER
in O
Goworowo B-LOC
, O
were O
detained O
in O
a O
stable O
on O
their O
way O
home O
. O

And O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
wanted O
to O
execute B-TER
them O
. O

Some O
peasant O
thankfully O
opened O
the O
stable O
for O
them O
in O
a O
moment O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
not O
there O
. O

And O
this O
way O
they O
survived O
. O

Once O
they O
gathered O
approximately O
50 O
Jews O
together O
with O
the O
rabbi B-TER
from O
the O
fields O
outside O
Goworowo B-LOC
and O
tortured B-TER
them O
terribly O
. O

One O
person O
was O
placed O
with O
his O
head O
on O
a O
log O
and O
an O
axe O
was O
lifted O
above O
his O
head O
. O

They O
did O
not O
chop B-TER
off I-TER
his I-TER
head I-TER
, O
only O
his O
beard B-TER
. O

Later O
they O
shaved B-TER
off I-TER
the I-TER
beards I-TER
of O
everyone O
. O

Only O
the O
rabbi B-TER
could O
keep O
his O
beard B-TER
. O

Two O
days O
after O
my O
arrival O
at O
home O
I O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
. O

I O
left O
to O
Śniadowo B-LOC
together O
with O
my O
brother B-TER
M. O
From O
there O
, O
we O
went O
through O
Łomża B-LOC

Białystok B-LOC
to O
… O
As O
people O
from O
Goworowo B-LOC
told O
us O

my O

later O
also O
escaped B-TER

They O
are O

X O
I O
was O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
from O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
war B-TER
until O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
German B-TER
invasion O
, O
I O
left O
on O
foot O
to O
Pulav B-LOC
( I-LOC
Puławy I-LOC
) I-LOC
in O
order O
to O
see O
how O
my O
mother B-TER
is O
doing O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Pulav B-LOC
passing O
through O
the O
shtetlekh O
Garwolin B-LOC
and O
Ryki B-LOC
. O

In O
Pulav B-LOC
, O
I O
stayed O
for O
3 O
days O
, O
and O
there O
, O
seeing O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
catching O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
, O
I O
ran O
to O
Kuzmir B-LOC
( I-LOC
Kazimierz I-LOC
[ I-LOC
Dolny I-LOC
] I-LOC
at O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
) O
. O

In O
Kuzmir B-LOC
, O
I O
stayed O
for O
8 O
days O
. O

From O
Kuzmir B-LOC
, O
I O
drove O
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
and O
, O
staying O
there O
until O
mid- O
November O
, O
I O
left O
for O
the O
Russian B-TER
side O
. O

Soon O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
Warsaw B-LOC
was O
overcrowded O
with O
refugees B-TER
who O
poured O
in O
from O
all O
surrounding O
cities O
, O
from O
nearby O
and O
faraway O
. O

Since O
everywhere O
it O
was O
overcrowded O
, O
they O
were O
crammed O
into O
the O
places O
of O
their O
acquaintances O
laying O
in O
the O
courtyards O
and O
flights O
of O
stairs O
. O

The O
city O
was O
continuously O
bombarded O
from O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
every O
day O
a O
new O
quarter O
. O

Every O
time O
news O
arrived O
about O
destroyed O
buildings O
and O
streets O
. O

I O
was O
a O
O.P.L O
Uncertain O
. O

.-Commander O
of O
my O
block O
, O
and O
it O
amounted O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
both O
to O
protect O
the O
house O
from O
fires O
and O
from O
looting B-TER
and O
robberies B-TER
. O

I O
also O
had O
to O
care O
for O
keeping O
the O
emotional O
equilibrium O
of O
the O
residents O
who O
were O
very O
nervous O
, O
upset O
. O

And O
I O
had O
to O
prevent O
any O
outbreak O
of O
panic O
and O
distress O
. O

At O
first O
, O
in O
the O
days O
from O
September O
6 O
to O
7 O
, O
I O
had O
in O
mind O
to O
follow O
the O
great O
mass O
of O
the O
Jewish O
youth O
: O
to O
leave O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

But O
when O
I O
came O
to O
my O
boss O
in O
order O
to O
say O
goodbye O
, O
he O
started O
to O
beg O
me O
not O
to O
leave O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O

Until O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
as O
mentioned O
before O
, O
Warsaw B-LOC
was O
bombarded O
day O
in O
, O
day O
out O
. O

But O
we O
had O
not O
endured O
a O
hell O
- O
like O
day O
before O
like O
the O
eve O
of O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
it O
was O
relatively O
calm O
. O

I O
left O
with O
a O
wagon O
for O
Grochów B-LOC
to O
the O
tannery O
and O
from O
there O
, O
I O
brought O
a O
wagon O
with O
leather O
( O
I O
had O
a O
special O
permit O
from O
the O
city B-LOC
headquarters I-LOC
to O
drive O
it O
) O
. O

When O
I O
came O
to O
Muranow B-LOC
Square I-LOC
, O
I O
was O
already O
trapped O
in O
the O
bombardment O
. O

Houses O
started O
to O
catch O
fire O
, O
flames O
flashed O
over O
from O
neighboring O
buildings O
where O
I O
lived O
and O
where O
I O
worked O
as O
a O
O.P.L.-commander O
( O
Nalewki B-LOC
No I-LOC
. I-LOC

40 I-LOC
) O
. O

The O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
in O
the O
basements O
of O
the O
house O
and O
we O
kept O
watch O
standing O
in O
the O
gate O
. O

At O
5 O
pm O
, O
we O
noticed O
how O
the O
fire O
from O
the O
German B-TER
incendiary O
bombs O
flashed O
over O
to O
Nalewki B-LOC
38 I-LOC
. O

The O
O.P.L.-headquarter B-LOC
decided O
that O
we O
had O
to O
prepare O
the O
crowd O
for O
a O
potential O
evacuation O
of O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
from O
the O
yard O
. O

We O
entered O
the O
basements O
and O
said O
: O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O
. O

We O
have O
to O
hang O
on O
, O
however O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
we O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
yard O
. O

But O
everyone O
should O
be O
careful O
and O
calm O
. O

In O
the O
basement O
, O
we O
, O
the O
O.P.L. O
activists O
( O
just O
like O
others O
) O
, O
had O
prepared O
hand O
luggage O
with O
the O
most O
necessary O
things O
in O
order O
to O
take O
it O
if O
need O
be O
. O

We O
took O
the O
suitcases O
and O
exited O
. O

The O
crowd O
, O
noticing O
that O
we O
took O
the O
suitcases O
, O
understood O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
serious O
and O
all O
at O
once O
everyone O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
basement O
. O

Everyone O
chaotically O
ran O
into O
the O
streets O
. O

People O
came O
running O
from O
everywhere O
and O
erratically O
, O
without O
a O
direction O
. O

I O
left O
for O
Shvyentayerske B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

I O
went O
there O
because O
my O
boss O
lives O
there O
and O
this O
corner O
was O
not O
touched O
by O
the O
bombardments O
and O
fires O
yet O
. O

At O
my O
boss O
’s O
house O
, O
I O
lived O
for O
3 O
days O
. O

His O
family B-TER
came O
running O
to O
him O
, O
however O
. O

7 O
individuals O
from O
Ayzn B-LOC
Street I-LOC
89 I-LOC
( O
Yakubovitsh B-LOC
) O
. O

Their O
house O
was O
hit O
by O
a O
bomb O
and O
destroyed O
their O
apartment O
. O

So O
they O
came O
to O
Shvyentayerske B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
I O
consequently O
had O
to O
move O
on O
. O

I O
left O
for O
Hazshe B-LOC
treet I-LOC
54 I-LOC
. O

During O
the O
whole O
bombardment O
until O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded O
, O
there O
were O
uncountable O
numbers O
of O
victims B-TER
, O
both O
those O
struck O
by O
shrapnels O
and O
those O
buried O
alive O
and O
heavily O
injured O
from O
bombs O
or O
burnt O
houses O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
it O
was O
calm O
. O

So O
I O
went O
out O
to O
have O
a O
look O
at O
the O
destruction O
of O
last O
night O
’s O
fire O
. O

The O
streets O
were O
full O
with O
corpses B-TER
. O

Freight O
wagons O
were O
driving O
across O
the O
streets O
and O
the O
victims B-TER
were O
placed O
on O
top O
on O
them O
. O

At O
the O
passageway O
Valove B-LOC
Street I-LOC
8 I-LOC
– O
Frantshishker B-LOC
Street I-LOC
29 I-LOC
, O
I O
saw O
a O
great O
number O
of O
burnt O
people O
. O

On O
the O
streets O
Stawki B-LOC
and O
Niska B-LOC
freight O
cars O
with O
corpses B-TER
were O
standing O
. O

On O
Frantshishker B-LOC
Street I-LOC
29 I-LOC
, O
the O
number O
of O
corpses B-TER
was O
estimated O
in O
the O
hundreds O
. O

On O
Gensha B-LOC
Street I-LOC
25 I-LOC
, O
35 O
men B-TER
were O
buried O
in O
the O
basements O
– O
among O
them O
my O
friend O
Reyman B-PER
, O
a O
house O
painter O
who O
lived O
on O
Muranowski B-LOC
Street I-LOC
40 I-LOC
, O
he O
was O
26 O
years O
of O
age O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
year O
after O
the O
wedding O
, O
he O
was O
alone O
from O
Chełm B-LOC
. O

For O
three O
weeks O
, O
he O
was O
laying O
under O
the O
debris O
. O

The O
following O
happened O
to O
me O
: O
on O
a O
certain O
day O
, O
a O
certain O
acquainted O
girl B-TER
came O
to O
me O
from O
Grochów B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
, O
we O
learned O
that O
Grochów B-LOC
had O
been O
bombarded O
heavily O
. O

The O
girl B-TER
went O
to O
great O
length O
to O
get O
home O
. O

I O
accompanied O
her O
to O
the O
Kerbedzsh B-LOC
bridge I-LOC
but O
in O
that O
same O
moment O
German B-TER
airplanes O
approached O
and O
started O
to O
heavily O
bombard O
the O
bridge B-LOC
and O
the O
royal B-LOC
palace I-LOC
. O

It O
was O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
my O
acquaintance O
was O
on O
the O
bridge B-LOC
. O

In O
shock O
, O
I O
let O
the O
bombardment O
pass O
and O
only O
afterwards O
I O
went O
looking O
for O
her O
. O

The O
bridge B-LOC
was O
perforated O
. O

I O
needed O
to O
jump O
from O
one O
plank O
to O
the O
next O
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
the O
dom O
żołmierza O
( O
soldiers B-TER
’ I-TER
home O
) O
was O
destroyed O
where O
one O
goes O
to O
the O
zoological O
garden O
. O

Under O
the O
debris O
, O
masses O
of O
corpses B-TER
were O
laying O
. O

I O
did O
not O
find O
my O
acquaintance O
. O

Only O
later O
, O
I O
got O
through O
to O
Grochów B-LOC
by O
phone O
and O
learned O
that O
she O
is O
alive O
. O

Immediately O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
it O
become O
possible O
to O
exit O
the O
city B-LOC
the O
next O
day O
. O

I O
left O
for O
Pulav B-LOC
to O
see O
how O
my O
mother B-TER
is O
doing O
. O

I O
went O
by O
foot O
. O

The O
140 O
kilometres O
took O
us O
3 O
days O
. O

One O
could O
only O
go O
until O
nightfall O
. O

We O
went O
in O
groups O
of O
two O
– O
me O
and O
another O
one O
, O
someone O
from O
Pulav B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
we O
spent O
the O
first O
night O
in O
a O
village O
near O
Otwock B-LOC
at O
a O
peasant O
’s O
house O
, O
and O
the O
second O
night O
in O
Ryki B-LOC
. O

We O
passed O
through O
Garwolin B-LOC
. O

The O
entire O
city O
was O
burnt O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Maybe O
a O
dozen O
houses O
remained O
intact O
. O

The O
Jewish O
population O
was O
not O
in O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

We O
met O
2 O
Jews O
who O
searched O
and O
rummaged O
in O
the O
rubble O
of O
their O
houses O
. O

In O
Ryki B-LOC
, O
we O
spent O
the O
night O
at O
the O
house O
of O
the O
Pulav B-LOC
rabbi B-TER
’s I-TER
son B-TER
( O
it O
was O
the O
second O
day O
of O
Sukkot O
) O
. O

More O
than O
60 O
percent O
of O
the O
city O
was O
burnt O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

The O
son B-TER
of O
the O
Pulav B-LOC
rabbi B-TER
told O
us O
that O
masses O
of O
Jews O
from O
Dęblin B-LOC
arrived O
in O
Ryki B-LOC
in O
the O
first O
week O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

They O
came O
to O
Ryki B-LOC
because O
in O
Dęblin B-LOC
there O
are O
great O
fortresses O
and O
airports B-LOC
. O

So O
Ryki B-LOC
’s O
population O
expected O
air O
strikes O
from O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Then O
the O
German B-TER
planes O
supposedly O
saw O
a O
big O
mob O
so O
they O
bombarded O
Ryki B-LOC
and O
that O
time O
400 O
residents O
of O
Dęblin B-LOC
and O
Ryki B-LOC
were O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
Pulav B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
half O
of O
the O
city O
was O
burnt O
to O
the O
ground O
as O
a O
result O
of O
German B-TER
incendiary O
bombs O
. O

The O
following O
were O
burnt O
down O
: O
the O
Pyaskove B-LOC
Street I-LOC
( O
where O
the O
butcher O
shops O
are O
) O
, O
the O
entire O

was O

Street I-LOC
( O

( O

. O

Both O
bote O
- O
midroshim O
and O
the O
old O
synagogue B-TER
were O
burnt B-TER
to O
the O
ground O
. O

In O
the O
old O
synagogue B-TER
, O
a O
granate O
came O
in O
and O
did O
not O
explode O
so O
the O
Germans B-TER
later O
blew O
up O
the O
granate O
and O
the O
synagogue B-TER
crumbled O
. O

Beside O
the O
hotel O

a O

40 O
men B-TER
from O
Pulav B-LOC
, O
primarily O
Jews O
, O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

Among O
the O
victims O
were O
: O

Gevirtsman B-PER
, O
a O
typesetter O
, O
he O
left O
behind O
a O
wife B-TER
with O
a O
child B-TER
; O

Dorfman B-PER

a O

in O
the O
Polish B-TER
secondary O

he O
lived O
on O
the O
Krantsover B-LOC
Street I-LOC
( O
his O
father B-TER
owns O
a O
grocery O
store O
) O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
Pulav B-LOC
for O
3 O
days O
and O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
catch O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
, O
I O
left O
for O
Kuzmir B-LOC
. O

Kuzmir B-LOC
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
bombardments O
. O

The O
city O
as O
a O
whole O
stayed O
intact O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
Kuzmir B-LOC
, O
a O
rumor O
circulated O
that O
in O
the O
coming O
night O
the O
Germans B-TER
will O
set O
fire O
to O
the O
city O
. O

2 O
peasants O
from O
Opole[Lubelskie B-LOC
] I-LOC
told O
this O
story O
. O

The O
Jews O
came O
out O
of O
the O
houses O
and O
they O
were O
laying O
in O
the O
yards O
for O
the O
whole O
night O
. O

It O
ended O
in O
a O
shock O
since O
very O
likely O
the O
Christians B-TER
themselves O
circulated O
the O
rumor O
in O
order O
to O
loot B-TER
the O
city B-LOC
. O

In O
Kuzmir B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
for O
a O
week O
and O
after O
that O
I O
drove O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

I O
transported O
merchandise O
back O
and O
forth O
. O

Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
the O
train B-TER
. O

But O
we O
put O
on O
matsheyuvkes O
caps O
with O
a O
visor O
( O
a O
kind O
of O
Polish B-TER
hat O
) O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
us O
for O
Christians B-TER
. O

This O
way O
, O
we O
drove O
back O
and O
forth O
for O
3 O
weeks O
. O

In O
Pulav B-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
time O
completely O
robbed B-TER
and O
ruined O
the O
Jews O
. O

At O
first O
, O
they O
took O
all O
Jewish O
stores O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
Poles B-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
drove O
out O
the O
Jews O
from O
all O
streets O
and O
permitted O
them O
to O
only O
live O
on O
Gdańsker B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
outside O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

Before O
the O
war B-TER
, O
Christians B-TER
were O
primarily O
living O
there O
. O

On O
houses O
, O
in O
which O
Jews O
were O
allowed O
to O
move O
in O
, O
they O
drew O
a O
Magen O
David O
through O
a O
stencil O
with O
red O
paint O
. O

Jews O
were O
allowed O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
other O
streets O
from O
10 O
am O
to O
12 O
at O
noon O
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
namely O
on O
Gdańsker B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
allowed O
to O
walk O
around O
the O
whole O
day O
. O

In O
a O
basement O
of O
Honigsfeld B-PER
’s O
house O
( O
the O
Jewish O
bank O
was O
there O
) O
, O
the O
Jews O
hid B-TER
their O
belongings O
. O

The O
basement O
was O
fire O
- O
proved O
. O

The O
house O
even O
burnt O
down O
and O
the O
basement O
stayed O
intact O
. O

Then O
the O
Germans B-TER
found O
out O
[ O
about O
the O
belongings O
] O
and O
took O
out O
everything O
from O
the O
basement O
. O

They O
admittedly O
gave O
notice O
to O
come O
to O
the O
city B-LOC
hall I-LOC
in O
order O
to O
identify O
and O
reclaim O
the O
things O
, O
but O
when O
the O
Jews O
came O
in O
city B-LOC
hall I-LOC
, O
they O
did O
not O
find O
anything O
anymore O
: O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
already O
taken O
everything O
for O
themselves O
or O
distributed O
it O
amongst O
the O
Christians B-TER
. O

I O
was O
in O
Pulav B-LOC
in O
the O
context O
of O
my O
business O
when O
the O
Jews O
were O
chased O
out O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

So O
I O
took O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
moved O
her O
to O
Nałęczów B-LOC
where O
an O
older O
sister B-TER
of O
mine O
is O
living O
. O

Nałęczów B-LOC
in O
general O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
the O
war O
. O

Once O
the O
German B-TER
airplanes O
threw O
bombs O
which O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
hit O
the O
shtetl O
. O

In O
Nałęczów B-LOC
, O
a O
German B-TER
general O
staff O
was O
established O
. O

On O
a O
certain O
day O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
went O
from O
house O
to O
house O
and O
dragged O
out O
the O
Jews O
. O

They O
gathered O
around O
30 O
Jews O
( O
there O
were O
not O
more O
than O
30 O
Jewish O
families B-TER
in O
Nałęczów B-LOC
) O
. O

They O
ordered O
them O
to O
lay O
down O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
in O
a O
puddle O
and O
swim O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
beaten O
mercilessly O
. O

Also O
my O
brother B-TER
-in O
- O
law O
and O
a O
son B-TER
of O
his O
were O
among O
the O
swimmer O
. O

From O
the O
beating O
, O
they O
got O
ill B-TER
and O
laid O
down O
in O
bed O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
shtetl O
and O
hid B-TER
. O

At O
that O
moment O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
leave O
the O
German B-TER
- O
occupied B-TER
territory O
. O

The O
interview O
took O
place O
on O
3.11.1954 O
, O
partly O
in O
English B-LOC
, O
partly O
in O
German B-LOC
. O

Miss O
X O
was O
born O
at O
Breslau B-LOC
in O
June O
1923 O
. O

Her O
father B-TER
is O
Jewish O
, O
her O
mother B-TER
Aryan O
. O

Her O
parents B-TER
separated O
, O
for O
purely O
private O
reasons O
, O
in O
1930 O
and O
were O
divorced O
in O
1934 O
. O

Miss O
stayed O
with O
her O
mother B-TER
who O
, O
shortly O
afterwards O
, O
married B-TER
an O
Aryan O

Mr. O
Krimke B-PER
emigrated B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
in O
1938 O
. O

Miss O
Krimke B-PER
joined O
her O
father B-TER
there O
after O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Miss O
X O
First O
of O
all O
I O
should O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
in O
some O
respects O
my O
story O
is O
not O
a O
typical O
one O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
living O
in O
an O
entirely O
non O
- O
Jewish O
household O
, O
am O
of O
Nordic O
appearance O
, O
and O
was O
converted B-TER
in O
June O
1933 O
from O
my O
father B-TER
’s I-TER
Jewish O
to O
my O
mother B-TER
’s I-TER
Protestant B-TER
faith B-TER
probably O
saved O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
unpleasantness O
. O

Neither O
my O
father B-TER
nor O
my O
mother B-TER
are O
strict O
in O
their O
respective O
religions B-TER
, O
and O
my O
early O
religious B-TER
upbringing O
had O
been O
correspondingly O
liberal O
; O
so O
that O
the O
conversion B-TER
itself O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
remember O
, O
made O
little O
impression O
on O
me O
. O

The O
practical O
significance O
, O
however O
, O
became O
soon O
apparent O
: O
At O
that O
time O
I O
attended O
a O
private O
school B-TER
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
Jewish O
pupils O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
1933 O
the O
classes B-TER
were O
separated O
into O
a O
Christian B-TER
and O
a O
Jewish O
section O
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
not O
on O
official O
orders B-TER
, O
but O
the O
initiative O
of O
the O
Headmaster O
. O

I O
was O
at O
first O
put O
into O
the O
Jewish O
section O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
was O
made O
to O
realize O
the O
problem O
of O
my O
part B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
parentage O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
that O
I O
was O
very O
upset O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
protested O
to O
the O
Headmaster O
, O
and O
I O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Christian B-TER
section O
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
incident O
, O
my O
school B-TER
- I-TER
life I-TER
was O
quite O
happy O
when O
I O
was O
twelve O
I O
changed O
over O
to O
a O
Lyzeum O
. O

The O
school B-TER
kept O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
to O
its O
liberal O
traditions O
. O

The O
teachers O
showed O
no O
discrimination B-TER
against O
me O
, O
although O
they O
all O
learned O
sooner O
or O
later O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
my O
work B-TER
was O
seriously O
affected O
by O
worry B-TER
about O
my O
father B-TER
in O
London B-LOC
, O
my O
Latin O
mistress O
went O
out O
of O
her O
way O
to O
be O
sympathetic O
and O
helpful O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
master O
who O
evidenced O
animosity O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
this O
was O
from O
racial B-TER
prejudice I-TER
. O

In O
such O
lessons O
as O
German B-LOC
, O
history O
and O
geography O
we O
were O
taught O
an O
exaggerated O
patriotism O
rather O
than O
specifically O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
doctrines O
. O

I O
can O
not O
recall O
any O
direct O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
observations O
Jewish O
achievements O
were O
simply O
not O
mentioned O
. O

The O
names O
of O
Spinoza O
, O
Ehrlich O
, O
Offenbach O
and O
Einstein O
- O
to O
gave O
but O
a O
few O
examples O
- O
were O
unknown O
to O
me O
until O
I O
came O
to O
England B-LOC
after O
the O
war B-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
only O
non O
- O
Aryan O
in O
my O
class B-TER
. O

There O
were O
some O
other O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
girls O
in O
the O
school B-TER
and O
I O
learnt O
from O
hearsay O
that O
their O
position O
was O
sometimes O
difficult O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
was O
always O
on O
excellent O
terms O
with O
my O
class O
- O
mates O
. O

My O
class B-TER
may O
have O
been O
exceptional O
in O
that O
it O
contained O
not O
a O
single O
ardent O
Nazi O
. O

At O
first O
my O
fellow O
pupils O
did O
not O
know O
of O
being O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

When O
somebody O
told O
them O
they O
decided O
, O
as O
I O
learnt O
later O
, O
to O
hide O
their O
knowledge O
from O
me O
in O
order O
to O
spare O
me O
any O
embarrassment O
. O

We O
were O
altogether O
not O
greatly O
interested O
in O
politics B-TER
. O

I O
passed O
my O
Abitur O
in O
1941 O
, O
the O
last O
year O
when O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
I O
was O
faced O
with O
my O
first O
real O
difficulties O
. O

Politics B-TER
had O
entered O
into O
my O
home O
life O
earlier O
and O
more O
forcefully O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
was O
a O
violent O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Nazi I-TER
. O

She O
talked O
very O
freely O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
constant O
fear O
that O
she O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

My O
step B-TER
- I-TER
father I-TER
was O
a O
Nazi O
of O
the O
idealistic O
type O
, O
who O
expected O
wonderful O
things O
of O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
. O

There O
were O
frequent O
and O
sometimes O
rather O
violent O
political O
arguments O
between O
him O
and O
my O
mother B-TER
. O

About O
Jews O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
strong O
feelings O
either O
for O
and O
against O
, O
and O
he O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
if O
were O
his O
own O
daughter O
. O

He O
had O
been O
a O
Party B-TER
member I-TER
, O
but O
although O
he O
had O
been O
told O
that O
the O
Party B-TER
would O
not O
object O
to O
his O
marrying B-TER
the O
former O
wife O
of O
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
mother B-TER
of O
a O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
child B-TER
, O
he O
was O
afterwards O
put O
under O
pressure O
to O
leave O
the O
Party B-TER
. O

My O
presence O
caused O
a O
number O
of O
problems O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
. O

I O
particularly O
remember O
the O
problem O
of O
ration O
stamps O
: O
As O
a O
rule O
, O
ration B-TER
stamps O
were O
distributed O
into O
the O
households O
by O
the O
street O
warden O
; O
but O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
had O
to O
collect O
them O
personally O
from O
a O
special O
Centre O
. O

This O
applied O
also O
to O
every O
member O
of O
a O
household O
which O
contained O
a O
non- O
Aryan B-TER
. O

To O
be O
seen O
regularly O
at O
this O
Centre O
for O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
would O
have O
gravely O
endangered O
my O
step B-TER
- I-TER
father I-TER
’s I-TER
position O
in O
the O
firm B-TER
which O
employed B-TER
him O
. O

He O
finally O
managed O
to O
obtain O
dispensation O
from O
the O
rule B-TER
, O
but O
we O
were O
still O
obliged O
to O
collect O
our O
ration B-TER
stamps O
from O
the O
Food B-TER
Office O
direct O
, O
and O
were O
not O
granted O
occasional O
extra O
rations B-TER
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
. O

This O
and O
similar O
difficulties O
are O
trifling O
in O
retrospect O
, O
but O
seemed O
very O
important O
at O
the O
time O
and O
made O
me O
disturbingly O
aware O
of O
my O
inferior O
status O
in O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
. O

This O
feeling O
increased O
with O
the O
problems O
which O
arose O
on O
my O
leaving O
school B-TER
. O

I O
had O
set O
my O
heart O
on O
a O
University B-TER
education B-TER
, O
but O
one O
could O
not O
be O
enrolled O
at O
a O
Univerity B-TER
before O
having O
completed O
the O
six O
months O
’s O
Labour B-TER
Service I-TER
( O
Arbeitsdienst O
) O
, O
from O
which O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
excluded O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
had O
to O
complete O
a O
Year O
of O
Duty O
( O
Pflichtjahr O
at O
some O
place O
where O
there O
was O
urgent O
need O
for O
a O
servant O
, O
as O
in O
families B-TER
with O
many O
children B-TER
. O

In O
my O
first O
service O
of O
this O
kind O
I O
did O
not O
mention O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
; O
when O
my O
employer B-TER
was O
informed O
of O
it O
, O
I O
was O
dismissed B-TER
. O

I O
finished O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
Protestant B-TER
cleric B-TER
, O
Kirchenrätin O
Viebig O
. O

She O
was O
markedly O
pro O
- O
Jewish O
, O
keeping O
up O
contact O
, O
at O
great O
risk O
to O
herself O
, O
with O
her O
Jewish O
friends O
until O
these O
were O
deported B-TER
. O

I O
was O
treated O
more O
as O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
house B-TER
than O
as O
a O
servant O
. O

During O
that O
time O
9 O
made O
several O
further O
application O
for O
admittance O
into O
the O
Labour B-TER
Service I-TER
. O

I O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
suggest O
that O
I O
was O
the O
illegitimate O
child B-TER
of O
an O
Aryan O
father B-TER
. O

I O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O

I O
felt O
very O
bitter O
about O
the O
whole O
situation O
in O
a O
quite O
childishly O
self O
- O
centred O
way O
. O

I O
blamed O
my O
mother B-TER
for O
having O
married B-TER
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
several O
times O
even O
told O
her O
so O
to O
her O
face O
. O

It O
was O
not O
that O
I O
experienced O
any O
conflict O
of O
loyalties O
or O
felt O
tainted O
by O
my O
Jewish O
blood O
. O

I O
simply O
resented O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
under O
a O
special O
handicap O
; O
most O
of O
all O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
start O
a O
career O
to O
which O
I O
felt O
my O
talents O
and O
education B-TER
entitled O
me O
. O

Inconsistently O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O
did O
not O
affect O
feelings O
towards O
my O
father B-TER
. O

I O
had O
always O
been O
on O
most O
affectionate O
terms O
with O
him O
. O

From O
the O
time O
when O
my O
parents O
separated O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
his O
emigration B-TER
I O
had O
visited O
him O
regularly O
. O

Shortly O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
I O
spent O
a O
holidays O
with O
him O
in O
London B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
considered O
for O
a O
while O
joining O
him O
there O
permanently O
. O

All O
through O
the O
war B-TER
I O
tried O
to O
obtain O
news O
from O
him O
though O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

My O
social O
relations O
with O
other O
young O
people O
were O
less O
problematic O
than O
the O
official O
discrimination B-TER
against O
non O
- O
Aryans O
would O
lead O
one O
to O
expect O
. O

None O
of O
my O
old O
friends O
changed O
her O
or O
his O
attitude O
. O

Whenever O
I O
met O
a O
young O
man B-TER
who O
seemed O
to O
take O
an O
illegible O
interest O
in O
me O
I O
told O
him O
at O
once O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

I O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
special O
implications O
. O

I O
considered O
such O
firendships O
and O
flirtations O
as O
proof O
that O
my O
personal O
attractions O
were O
stronger O
than O
the O
influence O
of O
official O
disapproval O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
I O
found O
that O
at O
least O
in O
the O
circles O
in O
which O
I O
moved O
the O
younger O
generation O
took O
Nazi B-TER
doctrines I-TER
far O
less O
seriously O
than O
their O
elders O
. O

The O
interest O
of O
my O
friends O
was O
mainly O
limited O
to O
their O
personal O
affairs O
; O
they O
were O
rather O
cynical O
in O
their O
attitude O
to O
politics B-TER
and O
the O
war B-TER
. O

The O
one O
exception O
I O
remember O
was O
, O
curiously O
enough O
, O
a O
Czech B-LOC
with O
whom O
I O
formed O
a O
serious O
attachment O
. O

He O
had O
pronounced O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
feeling O
, O
and O
at O
first O
I O
could O
not O
find O
the O
moral O
courage O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
my O
father B-TER
was O
Jewish O
. O

When O
I O
told O
him O
eventually O
, O
he O
got O
over O
the O
shock O
after O
having O
wrestled O
with O
the O
problem O
, O
as O
he O
told O
me O
, O
for O
a O
whole O
sleepless O
night O
. O

Our O
friendship O
continued O
, O
and O
at O
one O
stage O
we O
seriously O
considered O
marrying B-TER
. O

This O
brought O
home B-TER
to O
me O
the O
paradox O
of O
my O
position O
in O
regard O
to O
marriage B-TER
: O
as O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
I O
could O
marry B-TER
neither O
a O
Jew O
nor O
an O
Aryan O
without O
special O
permission O
; O
and O
as O
a O
German B-LOC
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
marry B-TER
, O
or O
have O
intimate O
relations O
with O
, O
a O
man B-TER
of O
inferior O
foreign B-TER
nationality I-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
frequently O
warned O
that O
I O
had O
been O
seen O
in O
the O
company O
of O
this O
Czech B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
this O
might O
get O
me O
into O
trouble O
. O

It O
did O
not O
come O
to O
a O
formal O
application O
for O
permission O
to O
marry B-TER
, O
but O
once O
I O
made O
a O
general O
enquiry O
as O
to O
my O
chances O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
marry B-TER
an O
Aryan O
. O

The O
official O
in O
charge O
of O
non O
- O
Aryan O
affairs O
in O
Breslau B-LOC
told O
me O
that O
my O
chances O
were O
fairly O
good O
, O
since O
neither O
my O
father B-TER
himself O
nor O
a O
member O
of O
his O
family B-TER
had O
received O
a O
University B-TER
education B-TER
; O
thus O
there O
was O
little O
risk O
of O
my O
transmitting O
Jewish O
intelligence O
to O
my O
children B-TER
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
I O
learnt O
that O
a O
strict O
watch O
was O
kept O
on O
all O
non O
- O
Aryans O
. O

The O
official O
knew O
practically O
everything O
about O
my O
family B-TER
affairs O
, O
work B-TER
, O
friendships O
etc O
. O

After O
the O
completion O
of O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
I O
found O
it O
difficult O
, O
as O
a O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewess I-TER
, O
to O
find O
suitable O
employment B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
finish O
a O
course O
in O
shorthand O
- O
typing O
at O
the O
[ O
Städtische O
Handelsschule O
] O
. O

I O
had O
to O
leave O
a O
congenial O
position O
as O
shop B-TER
assistant I-TER
in O
a O
music O
shop O
, O
because O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
forbidden O
employment B-TER
which O
would O
bring O
them O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
general O
public O
. O

I O
applied O
for O
a O
job B-TER
in O
a O
factory B-TER
owned O
by O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
my O
father B-TER
's I-TER
. O

At O
first O
he O
did O
not O
dare O
take O
me O
on O
because O
, O
having O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
wife O
, O
he O
was O
himself O
in O
a O
delicate O
position O
. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
him O
a O
little O
later O
through O
the O
official O
employment B-TER
exchange O
, O
he O
engaged O
me O
as O
a O
typist B-TER
. O

I O
had O
no O
difficulties O
with O
my O
fellow B-TER
- I-TER
workers I-TER
in O
the O
office O
. O

In O
August O
1944 O
I O
was O
drafted O
into O
a O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
, O
Unternehmen O
Berthold O
, O
about O
20 O
miles O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

We O
numbered O
approximately O
150 O
girls B-TER
, O
for O
the O
greater O
part O
children B-TER
of O
mixed O
marriages B-TER
, O
like O
myself O
( O
though O
there O
were O
also O
some O
Aryan O
and O
a O
few O
Jewesses O
who O
somehow O
had O
escaped B-TER
arrest B-TER
and O
deportation B-TER
before O
them O
) O
. O

divided O
into O
5 O
groups O
. O

Some O
Nordic O
-looking O
girls B-TER
, O
including O
myself O
, O
were O
picked O
out O
to O
be O
group O
leaders O
. O

We O
were O
made O
to O
dig O
fortifications O
, O
but O
supervision O
was O
rather O
lax O
and O
we O
did O
not O
overwork O
ourselves O
. O

Our O
accommodation B-TER
, O
first O
in O
a O
barn B-TER
, O
later O
on O
the O
dance O
floor O
of O
a O
country O
inn B-TER
, O
was O
primitive O
, O
the O
food B-TER
bad O
and O
insufficient O
, O
and O
the O
sanitary B-TER
arrangements O
shocking O
. O

Our O
guards O
, O
uniformed B-TER
members O
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
were O
unpleasant O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
physical O
violence B-TER
. O

Frequent O
beatings B-TER
, O
however O
, O
occurred O
in O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
near O
- O
by O
, O
as O
we O
learnt O
from O
the O
men B-TER
when O
we O
met O
them O
at O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
daily O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
were O
perfunctory O
, O
and O
some O
of O
us O
went O
several O
times O
secretly O
to O
Breslau B-LOC
for O
a O
day O
. O

We O
did O
not O
try O
to O
escape B-TER
altogether O
, O
as O
we O
feared O
that O
reprisals O
would O
be O
taken O
against O
those O
left O
behind O
. O

Almost O
from O
the O
beginning O
we O
developed O
a O
strong O
spirit O
of O
solidarity O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
acquired O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
positive O
attitude O
towards O
the O
Jewish O
part O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Previously O
I O
had O
felt O
the O
kind O
of O
Jewish O
antisemitism O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
was O
often O
found O
in O
some O
sections O
of O
German B-LOC
Jewry O
. O

This O
feeling O
I O
lost O
completely O
through O
the O
intimate O
contact O
with O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
, O
some O
of O
whom O
had O
physically O
and O
mentally O
strong O
Jewish O
characteristics O
. O

Without O
that O
experience O
, O
I O
doubt O
that O
later O
on O
I O
would O
have O
made O
the O
decision O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
and O
live O
with O
my O
father B-TER
. O

Some O
girls B-TER
- O
very O
few O
- O
tried O
to O
curry O
favour O
with O
the O
guards B-TER
and O
slept O
with O
them O
. O

They O
were O
boycotted O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
. O

Their O
behaviour O
was O
considered O
treacherous O
. O

There O
was O
no O
objection O
to O
sexual B-TER
misbehaviour O
, O
as O
such O
including O
Lesbian B-TER
practices O
, O
of O
which O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
outlook O
on O
sexual B-TER
behaviour O
amongst O
my O
contemporaries O
had O
become O
completely O
cynical O
under O
the O
Nazi O
regime O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
war B-TER
. O

When O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
the O
Russian B-ORG
army I-ORG
had O
advanced O
to O
within O
hearing O
distance O
of O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
I O
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
girls B-TER
made O
our O
escape B-TER
. O

This O
was O
not O
difficult O
, O
as O
by O
that O
time O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
already O
demoralised O
and O
hardly O
tried O
to O
maintain O
control O
. O

On O
the O

of O

it O
. O

In O
1940 O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
obtained O
employment O
with O
Geb O
. O

Roever O
, O
Aktiengesellschaft B-TER
. O

This O
gentile O
firm B-TER
employed O
many O
Jews O
in O
separate O
and O
inferior B-TER
departments O
to O
the O
gentile O
workers B-TER
. O

They O
also O
received O
smaller O
remuneration O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
, O
as O
Mischling O
, O
was O
, O
at O
first O
, O
allowed O
to O
work B-TER
together O
with O
the O
gentiles O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
an O
SA B-ORG
control O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
, O
who O
has O
presumably O
been O
denounced O
by O
one O
of O
her O
colleagues O
, O
was O
asked O
by O
an O
SA B-ORG
man I-ORG
how O
much O
she O
earned B-TER
. O

An O
unpleasant O
scene O
ensued O
and O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
sewing B-TER
department I-TER
with O
the O
full O
- O
Jews O
, O
where O
she O
earned B-TER
considerably O
less O
. O

When O
the O
regulation B-TER
first O
came O
into O
existence O
, O
according O
to O
which O
Jews O
were O
forced O
to O
wear O
a O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
made O
an O
application O
through O
her O
lawyer B-TER
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
in O
which O
she O
maintained O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
star B-TER
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
re B-TER
- I-TER
marriage I-TER
. O

She O
based O
this O
on O
a O
clause O
in O
the O
regulation B-TER
which O
stated O
that O
Jews O
married O
to O
gentiles O
, O
whose O
children O
had O
a O
Christian O
up O
- O
bringing O
, O
need O
not O
wear O
the O
star O
, O
even O
if O
the O
marriage O
had O
been O
dissolved O
. O

There O
was O
a O
time O
- O
lapse O
of O
three O
months O
while O
her O
applicatiogestagestn O
was O
being O
considered O
. O

Meanwhile O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
did O
not O
wear O
the O
star B-TER
and O
therefore O
did O
not O
suffer O
the O
resulting O
loss O
of O
privilege O
( O
smaller O
rations B-TER
etc O
) O
. O

After O
three O
months O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
was O
summoned O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
H.Q. O
in O
Lindenstrasse O
. O

Here O
, O
after O
a O
two O
hour O
wait O
, O
during O
which O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
accosted O
and O
insulted O
her O
in O
the O
corridor O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
was O
interviewed O
by O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
, O
Schmidt B-PER
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
more O
humanity O
than O
most O
of O
his O
colleagues O
. O

However O
, O
he O
told O
her O
that O
he O
had O
received O
orders B-TER
from O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
that O
she O
had O
, O
in O
future O
, O
to O
wear O
the O
star B-TER
. O

During O
the O
interview O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
Commissar O
entered O
, O
shouted O
at O
her O
and O
told O
her O
she O
would O
be O
sent O
to O
prison B-TER
and O
deported B-TER
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
answered O
very O
quietly O
and O
the O
Commissar O
left O
without O
taking O
any O
further O
action O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
at O
another O
table O
in O
the O
same O
room O
, O
another O
Mischling O
was O
being O
interviewed O
. O

Her O
children B-TER
had O
had O
a O
Jewish B-TER
education I-TER
. O

Suddenly O
the O
doors O
were O
flung O
open O
and O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
officer O
yelled O
: O
Any O
more O
for O
prison O
? O
and O
the O
woman B-TER
was O
dragged B-TER
away O
. O

Before O
allowing O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
to O
leave O
, O
Schmidt B-PER
asked O
her O
to O
send O
her O
father O
to O
his O
office O
, O
as O
he O
, O
too O
, O
now O
had O
to O
wear O
a O
star B-TER
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
asked O
whether O
anything O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
and O
Schmidt B-PER
assured O
her O
that O
he O
would O
be O
sent O
back O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
asked O
whether O
she O
could O
not O
simply O
give O
her O
father O
the O
message O
, O
and O
Schmidt B-PER
finally O
agreed O
to O
her O
request O
. O

Deportation B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
- I-LOC
am I-LOC
- I-LOC
Main I-LOC
The O
first O
two O
transports B-TER
, O
consisting O
only O
of O
full O
Jews O
, O
had O
left O
Frankfurt B-LOC
for O
Poland B-LOC
and O
Minsk B-LOC
on O
October O
and O
November O
1941 O
, O
respectively O
. O

In O
May O
, O
1942 O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
was O
leaving O
her O
home B-TER
when O
she O
met O
an O
officer O
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
entering O
the O
house B-TER
. O

As O
the O
Community B-TER
had O
to O
compile O
the O
lists O
for O
the O
transports B-TER
and O
had O
to O
break O
the O
news O
to O
the O
deportees B-TER
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
feared B-TER
the O
worst O
. O

Indeed O
, O
she O
was O
on O
the O
list O
of O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
. O

She O
went O
immediately O
to O
see O
the O
lawyer O
, O
who O
represented O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
and O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
relative O
of O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
. O

The O
lawyer O
suggested O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
escape B-TER
deportation B-TER
was O
to O
divorce B-TER
her I-TER
Jewish I-TER
husband I-TER
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
's I-PER
brother O
there O
upon O
went O
to O
Gestapo B-ORG
H.Q. O
where O
he O
was O
told O
that O
if O
divorce B-TER
proceedings O
had O
been O
started O
by O
that O
same O
afternoon O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
would O
not O
be O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
was O
spent O
in O
running O
from O
office O
to O
office O
( O
Jews O
were O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to O
use O
public O
transport O
) O
until O
a O
document O
was O
obtained O
stating O
officially O
that O
proceedings O
had O
been O
begun O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
then O
took O
this O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
who O
, O
at O
first O
refused O
to O
accept O
it O
and O
asked O
why O
she O
had O
waited O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
to O
begin O
proceedings O
and O
why O
she O
had O
married B-TER
a O
Jew O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
answered O
that O
if O
they O
( O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
) O
had O
any O
humanity O
( O
Menschliches O
Verstaendnis O
) O
at O
all O
, O
they O
would O
understand O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
give O
her O
daughter O
a O
home B-TER
and O
had O
married B-TER
for O
her O
sake O
. O

This O
evidently O
had O
some O
effect O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
officers O
who O
passed O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
's I-PER
application O
not O
to O
be O
deported B-TER
, O
not O
because O
of O
the O
divorce O
, O
but O
because O
we O
do O
have O
humanity O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
man O
came O
to O
collect O
her O
for O
the O
transport B-TER
. O

She O
told O
him O
that O
she O
was O
not O
to O
go O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
left O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
H.Q. B-ORG
, O
telling O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
that O
if O
he O
did O
not O
return O
by O
12 O
a.m. O
, O
she O
would O
not O
be O
taken O
. O

He O
did O
not O
return O
, O
and O
so O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
escaped B-TER
almost O
certain O
death B-TER
. O

For O
nothing O
was O
ever O
heard O
again O
from O
anyone O
who O
left O
on O
this O
transport B-TER
. O

Amongst O
other O
of O
her O
acquaintances O
who O
were O
taken O
away O
on O
this O
transport B-TER
was O
an O
Eduard B-PER
Stern I-PER
, O
the O
Jewish O
hairdresser B-TER
, O
whose O
job B-TER
it O
had O
been O
to O
cut O
the O
hair O
of O
the O
deportees B-TER
at O
the O
collecting O
centre O
. O

With O
Stern B-PER
were O
his O
wife O
and O
his O
10 O
year O
- O
old O
daughter B-TER
. O

In O
August O
, O
1942 O
, O
Hermann B-PER
Fraenkel I-PER
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
's I-PER
father O
- O
in O
- O
law O
, O
was O
deported B-TER
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

He O
had O
previously O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
Jewish O
Old B-TER
Age I-TER
Home I-TER
, O
Hermesweg O
. O

The O
home B-TER
was O
kept O
in O
existence O
after O
the O
dissolution O
of O
all O
the O
others O
. O

To O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
Hermesweg O
home O
meant O
certain O
deportation B-TER
. O

Hermann B-PER
Fraenkel I-PER
was O
67 O
years O
old O
at O
the O
time O
. O

In O
September O
, O
1942 O
, O
Arthur B-PER
Obst I-PER
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
's I-PER
uncle O
, O
was O
also O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
also O
67 O
years O
old O
. O

He O
wrote O
from O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
telling O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
in O
veiled O
terms O
that O
Hermann B-PER
Fraenkel I-PER
was O
dead B-TER
. O

At O
this O
time O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
asked O
Mischlinge O
to O
help O
in O
feeding O
and O
caring O
for O
the O
deportees B-TER
at O
the O
collecting O
centre O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
volunteered O
and O
continued O
to O
do O
this O
until O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
in O
1945 O
. O

The O
deportees B-TER
slept O
for O
one O
night O
at O
the O
centre O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
there O
was O
a O
luggage O
check O
, O
when O
Gestapo B-ORG
officers O
stole B-TER
what O
they O
happened O
to O
fancy O
from O
the O
luggage O
. O

Next O
, O
by O
lorry O
to O
the O
station O
, O
where O
they O
were O
herded O
into O
the O
train B-TER
like O
cattle O
. O

Finally O
, O
before O
the O
departure O
, O
minor O
Gestapo B-ORG
officials O
walked O
through O
the O
trains B-TER
and O
stole B-TER
such O
things O
as O
fountain O
- O
pens O
, O
cigarette O
lighters O
, O
hats B-TER
. O

Summary O
. O

In O
all O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
was O
remarkably O
untouched O
throughout O
this O
period O
. O

She O
suffered O
the O
deprivations O
expected O
in O
war B-TER
- I-TER
time I-TER
, O
accentuated O
by O
her O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
. O

Her O
main O
recollection O
is O
of O
constant O
nervous O
strain O
, O
of O
constant O
fear B-TER
for I-TER
her I-TER
friends I-TER
and I-TER
relatives I-TER
; O
of O
stories O
of O
terror O
and O
brutality O
, O
of O
constant O
attempts O
to O
humiliate B-TER
her O
and O
her O
Jewish O
friends O
and O
relatives O
. O

But O
apart O
from O
petty O
persecutions O
at O
work B-TER
and O
verbal O
insults O
from O
Nazis O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PER
never O
once O
witnessed O
actual O
physical B-TER
brutality I-TER
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
after O
1942 O
she O
spent O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
with O
the O
deportees B-TER
and O
their O
Gestapo B-ORG
guards B-TER
. O

After O
the O
war B-TER
she O
joined O
her O
divorced O
husband O
in O
London B-LOC
where O
they O
re B-TER

married I-TER

Soon O
after O

I O
was O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O

After O

of O
one O

a O
half O
years O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC

reimprisoned B-TER

This O
section O
of O
the O

called O
Birkenau O
. O

I O
was O
brought O
in O
as O
a O
political B-TER
prisoner B-TER
late O
at O
night O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
, O
which O
covered O
an O
area O
of O
many O
kilometres O
, O
was O
illuminated O
as O
bright O
as O
day O
, O
despite O
the O
war B-TER

An O
SS B-TER
woman B-TER
and O
an O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
with O
two O
large O

beat O
us O

drove O
us O
into O
a O
barracks B-TER

where O
we O
were O
shut O
in O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
shorn O
bald O
and O
I O
was O
tattooed O
with O
the O
number O
70159 O
on O
my O
left O
forearm O
. O

All O
luggage O

valuables O
were O
confiscated B-TER
and O
, O
although O
it O
was O
mid O
- O
December O
and O
icy O
cold O
, O
we O
were O
each O
given O
a O
thin O
dress B-TER
, O
a O
set O
of O
ripped O
summer O
underclothes B-TER
and O
a O

of O
clogs B-TER
. O

No O
hosiery B-TER
, O
no O

and O
nothing O
to O
cover O
our O

. O

After O
only O
a O
few O
steps O
in O
the O
clogs B-TER
, O
my O
feet O
were O
rubbed O
raw O
and O
bleeding B-TER
. O

Like O
all O
other O
newcomers O
, O
I O
was O
put O
in O
quarantine B-TER
barracks I-TER
, O
where O
I O
remained O
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

The O
barracks B-TER
were O
not O
heated O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
beds O
, O
we O
had O
so O
- O
called O
bunks O
, O
which O
were O
a O
sort O
of O
box O
. O

Two O
of O
these O
lay O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
, O
and O
eight O
people B-TER
slept O
in O
each O
. O

For O
eight O
people B-TER
, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
blankets O
. O

Every O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
woken O
at O
4 O
am O
by O
a O
piercing O
whistle O
and O
we O
were O
required O
to O
have O
got O
up O
within O
two O
minutes O
, O
otherwise O
there O
was O
a O
hail O
of O
blows O
. O

At O
quarter O
past O
four O
, O
tea B-TER
or O
sometimes O
some O
sort O
of O
coffee B-TER
was O
shared O
out O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
tried O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
clean O
used O
this O
drink B-TER
to O
wash B-TER
with O
, O
as O
the O
only O
other O
available O
water B-TER
was O
generally O
frozen O
over O
. O

At O
4.30 O
am O
, O
we O
had O
to O
present O
ourselves O
for O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
and O
stand O
completely O
still O
until O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
accounted O
for O
. O

At O
6 O
am O
, O
the O
labour B-TER
battalions I-TER
marched O
out O
. O

We O
quarantine O
prisoners B-TER
did O
not O
go O
out O
to O
work B-TER
and O
we O
attempted O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
warm O
, O
at O
least O
as O
far O
as O
this O
was O
possible O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
not O
to O
be O
noticed O
in O
any O
way O
, O
because O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
labour B-TER
battalions I-TER
had O
left O
, O
the O
selections B-TER
began O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
with O
the O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
( O
a O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
at O
that O
time O

, O
also O
accompanied O
by O
two O
high O
- O
ranking O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
visited O
every O
barrack B-TER
and O
ordered O
the O
prisoners B-TER
to O
report O
to O
them O
. O

We O
had O
to O
undress B-TER
completely O
and O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
we O
were O
selected B-TER
for O
gassing B-TER
due O
to O
any O
of O
the O
following O
reasons O
: O
a O
skin B-TER
rash I-TER
, O
which O
was O
unavoidable O
due O
to O
bugs B-TER
and O
lack B-TER
of I-TER
vitamins I-TER
; O
too O
thin O
; O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
; O
or O
simply O
a O
face O
that O
did O
not O
fit O
. O

Those O
whose O
numbers O
were O
written O
down O
, O
were O
delivered O
by O
the O
block O
elder O
, O
who O
was O
also O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
to O
Block O
Number O
25 O
. O

This O
block O
was O
always O
so O
over O
- O
full O
because O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
were O
so O
overloaded O
that O
many O
who O
had O
been O
selected B-TER
to O
be O
gassed B-TER
had O
to O
wait O
a O
week O
until O
it O
was O
their O
turn O
. O

The O
selected B-TER
victims B-TER
were O
shut O
in O
this O
barrack B-TER
number O
25 O
, O
stark O
naked O
, O
without O
beds O
, O
without O
washing B-TER
facilities I-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
toilets B-TER
in O
any O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
just O
mass O
latrines B-TER
in O
a O
separate O
building O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
of O
number O
25 O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
the O
latrines B-TER
, O
as O
one O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
try O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
their O
panic O
. O

They O
were O
given O
nothing O
to O
drink B-TER
. O

Once O
a O
day O
, O
at O
6 O
pm O
, O
a O
basket O
of O
bread B-TER
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
for O
which O
the O
prisoners B-TER
then O
beat O
each O
other O
half O
dead B-TER
. O

Whenever O
I O
passed O
by O
barrack B-TER
25 O
, O
I O
saw O
arms O
stuck O
out O
of O
the O
barred O
windows O
and O
heard O
whimpering O
voices O
, O
begging B-TER
for O
water B-TER
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
all O
of O
those O
selected B-TER
for O
gassing B-TER
inside O
the O
camp B-TER
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

In O
contrast O
were O
the O
big O
transports B-TER
that O
rolled O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
every O
single O
day O
, O
although O
most O
of O
them O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
as O
well O
, O
they O
were O
at O
least O
spared O
the O
agony O
of O
knowing O
that O
they O
were O
facing O
certain O
death B-TER
. O

In O
their O
case O
, O
it O
took O
place O
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
the O
cattle B-TER
trucks I-TER
rolled O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
wagons B-TER
were O
opened O
, O
the O
dead B-TER
were O
brought O
out O
, O
as O
most O
of O
these O
trains B-TER
were O
underway O
for O
several O
days O
and O
contained O
many O
elderly O
people B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
, O
together O
with O
other O
SS B-TER
officers I-TER
, O
and O
the O
female B-TER
camp I-TER
commanders B-TER
mustered O
all O
of O
the O
incomers O
and O
sorted O
them O
according O
to O
the O
following O
criteria O
: O
young O
, O
healthy B-TER
-looking O
men B-TER
to O
one O
side O
; O
older O
people B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
those O
who O
looked O
ill B-TER
or O
pale O
to O
the O
other O
. O

Amongst O
the O
women B-TER
, O
all O
of O
those O
who O
came O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
with O
children B-TER
were O
put O
onto O
the O
same O
side O
as O
the O
older O
and O
ill B-TER
-looking O
men B-TER
. O

A O
small O
batch O
were O
then O
led O
into O
camp B-TER
under O
SS B-TER
guard B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
shorn O
, O
tattooed O
and O
completely O
undressed B-TER
and O
then O
incorporated O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

All O
of O
the O
others O
were O
led O
directly O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

They O
were O
told O
they O
were O
going O
to O
be O
bathed B-TER
, O
and O
were O
urged O
to O
tie O
their O
clothes B-TER
together O
well O
, O
so O
that O
they O
could O
find O
them O
again O
after O
their O
wash B-TER
. O

After O
they O
were O
undressed B-TER
, O
they O
were O
brought O
into O
a O
vast O
room O
and O
, O
when O
it O
was O
bulging O
full O
, O
it O
was O
locked O
shut O
. O

Then O
the O
gas B-TER
was O
let O
in O
and O
, O
after O
terrible O
agony O
, O
they O
would O
die B-TER
in O
approximately O
ten O
minutes O
. O

I O
am O
reporting O
this O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
knowledge O
and O
conscience O
, O
although O
I O
was O
obviously O
never O
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
myself O
. O

However O
, O
I O
knew O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
special O
unit O
( O
Sonderkommando B-TER
) O
. O

Once O
, O
he O
smuggled B-TER
himself O
into O
the O
womens B-TER
’ I-TER
camp I-TER
under O
a O
pretext O
and O
told O
me O
about O
his O
work B-TER
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
consisted O
solely O
of O
Jews O
who O
were O
forced O
to O
do O
this O
work B-TER
. O

They O
did O
all O
of O
the O
work B-TER
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
apart O
from O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
gas B-TER
, O
which O
was O
left O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

It O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
to O
sort O
out O
the O
corpses B-TER
after O
the O
gassing B-TER
, O
which O
were O
stuck O
to O
each O
other O
in O
wild O
convolutions O
after O
their O
agonising O
death B-TER
throes O
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
then O
had O
to O
break O
all O
gold O
teeth O
out O
of O
the O
corpses B-TER
and O
they O
were O
also O
responsible O
for O
the O
incineration B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
bodies I-TER
. O

Members O
of O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
were O
strictly O
separated O
from O
the O
ordinary O
prisoners B-TER
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
barrack B-TER
and O
were O
treated O
unusually O
well O
for O
the O
duration O
of O
their O
work B-TER
. O

They O
were O
given O
as O
much O
food B-TER
and O
alcohol B-TER
and O
as O
many O
cigarettes O
as O
they O
wanted O
. O

However O
, O
every O
six O
months O
they O
had O
to O
go O
the O
same O
way O
as O
those O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
burn B-TER
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
was O
changed O
over O
every O
six O
months O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
danger O
of O
any O
survivors B-TER
remaining O
after O
the O
war B-TER
who O
would O
be O
able O
to O
give O
eyewitness O
accounts O
of O
their O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
late O
autumn O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
who O
had O
prepared O
themselves O
to O
be O
killed B-TER
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
decided O
to O
riot B-TER
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
unsuccessful O
and O
the O
result O
was O
that O
they O
were O
all O
shot B-TER
whilst O
trying O
to O
break B-TER
out I-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Two O
weeks O
after O
my O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
taken O
ill B-TER
with O
spotted B-TER
fever I-TER
, O
an O
illness B-TER
that O
was O
rife O
every O
winter O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
could O
not O
be O
fought O
off O
, O
because O
we O
were O
all O
completely O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
and O
the O
germs O
spread O
themselves O
through O
the O
lice B-TER
. O

I O
was O
marked O
down O
for O
gassing B-TER
twice O
, O
but O
was O
saved O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
both O
times O
. O

The O
first O
time O
was O
because O
my O
sister O
, O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
orchestra B-TER
, O
appealed O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
who O
had O
a O
weakness O
for O
music B-TER
and O
the O
second O
time O
because O
one O
of O
the O
selection B-TER
officers O
( O
Hessler B-PER
) O
, O
who O
incidentally O
has O
since O
been O
executed B-TER
in O
Hamelin B-LOC
( O
Hameln B-LOC
) O
, O
was O
humane O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
crossed O
out O
my O
name O
again O
. O

There O
was O
no O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
available O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
there O
was O
no O
medicine B-TER
. O

The O
few O
medicines B-TER
, O
that O
were O
smuggled B-TER
under O
great O
danger O
by O
the O
prisoners B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
warehouses O
, O
were O
only O
obtainable O
if O
one O
had O
a O
valuable O
means O
of O
barter B-TER
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
typhus B-TER
, O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
chronic O
dysentery B-TER
, O
an O
illness B-TER
that O
claimed O
more O
lives O
than O
the O
typhus B-TER
. O

We O
all O
suffered O
from O
open O
, O
festering O
wounds B-TER
on O
our O
whole O
bodies O
, O
because O
of O
the O
complete O
lack B-TER
of I-TER
vitamins I-TER
in O
our O
diet B-TER
. O

Our O
nutrition B-TER
consisted O
of O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
which O
was O
shared O
out O
in O
the O
evenings O
and O
had O
to O
be O
sufficient O
until O
the O
next O
evening O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
bowl O
of O
nondescript O
soup B-TER
, O
in O
which O
a O
few O
chunks O
of O
turnip B-TER
swam O
. O

Absolutely O
no O
fruit B-TER
, O
nor O
vegetables B-TER
. O

Hard O
workers B-TER
received O
a O
3 O
cm O
long O
piece O
of O
black O
pudding B-TER
and O
a O
tiny O
piece O
of O
cheese B-TER
twice O
a O
week O
. O

Saltpetre O
was O
also O
cooked O
in O
the O
soup O
to O
prevent O
the O
women B-TER
from O
menstruating O
. O

None O
of O
the O
female B-TER
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
dependent O
on O
the O
food B-TER
provided O
by O
the O
camp B-TER
ever O
got O
their O
period O
. O

After O
four O
weeks O
of O
quarantine O
, O
I O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
and O
assigned O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
work B-TER
consisted O
mainly O
of O
carrying O
stones O
and O
shovelling O
clay O
, O
as O
well O
as O
loading O
and O
unloading O
waggons B-TER
. O

We O
worked B-TER
eleven O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
with O
a O
ten O
minute O
break O
at O
midday O
, O
when O
we O
were O
given O
a O
bowl O
of O
soup B-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
spoons O
and O
the O
soup B-TER
was O
so O
hot O
, O
that O
we O
were O
often O
unable O
to O
eat B-TER
it O
in O
the O
time O
available O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
guarded B-TER
the O
entire O
time O
whilst O
we O
were O
working B-TER
by O
the O
SS B-TER
with O
dogs O
, O
which O
they O
released O
on O
us O
, O
if O
we O
paused O
for O
even O
a O
moment O
to O
catch O
our O
breath O
. O

At O
6 O
pm O
, O
we O
marched O
back O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
so O
deathly O
tired O
that O
one O
always O
tried O
to O
support O
the O
others O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
we O
had O
to O
sing O
marching O
songs B-TER
and O
march O
at O
a O
walking O
pace O
. O

If O
someone O
lagged O
behind O
a O
bit O
, O
the O
dog O
was O
set O
loose O
on O
them O
. O

At O
the O
camp B-TER
gates O
stood O
two O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
and O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
who O
counted O
us O
and O
occasionally O
one O
of O
us O
would O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
ranks O
and O
searched O
. O

We O
beside O
the O
unlucky O
ones O
who O
tried O
to O
smuggle B-TER
a O
turnip B-TER
or O
a O
tomato B-TER
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

They O
would O
be O
battered B-TER
so O
badly O
until O
they O
were O
lying O
unconscious O
on O
the O
road O
: O
if O
they O
were O
lucky O
and O
could O
get O
themselves O
up O
out O
of O
the O
dust O
inconspicuously O
, O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
over O
. O

If O
they O
stayed O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
they O
would O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
and O
gassed B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
fogged O
day O
and O
night O
in O
a O
fatty O
, O
black O
smoke O
that O
came O
from O
the O
three O
chimneys O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

The O
stench O
, O
which O
I O
became O
used O
to O
after O
several O
months O
, O
was O
so O
unbearable O
that O
I O
continually O
vomited B-TER
. O

It O
was O
the O
revolting O
, O
sweet O
stench O
of O
burnt B-TER
flesh I-TER
and I-TER
hair I-TER
. O

Those O
primarily O
responsible O
for O
the O
gassings B-TER
were O
: O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
, O
a O
young O
man B-TER
whose O
pet O
fad O
it O
was O
to O
conduct O
experiments B-TER
on O
twins O
for O
his O
thesis O
on O
this O
subject O
; O
Dr. B-PER
Klein I-PER
, O
who O
was O
sentenced O
to O
death B-TER
at O
trial B-TER
in O
Lüneburg B-LOC
; O
the O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
Cramer B-PER
, O
also O
executed B-TER
; O
and O
the O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
Mandel B-PER
and O
Drechsel B-PER
. O

Mandel B-PER
and O
Drechsel B-PER
were O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
aware O
, O
never O
found O
, O
and O
are O
probably O
still O
at O
large O
. O

The O
occupants O
of O
my O
barrack B-TER
consisted O
of O
Italian B-LOC
, O
French B-LOC
, O
Greek B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
women B-TER
. O

The O
hardiest O
prisoners B-TER
were O
the O
Poles B-LOC
and O
Russians B-LOC
, O
whereas O
the O
Greeks B-LOC
and O
Italians B-LOC
died B-TER
like O
flies O
. O

If O
they O
did O
n’t O
die O
a O
natural O
death B-TER
from O
typhus B-TER
or O
dysentery B-TER
, O
they O
were O
inevitably O
chosen O
at O
the O
selections B-TER
. O

They O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
icy O
winter O
weather O
and O
suffered O
terribly O
from O
the O
symptoms O
of O
frostbite B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
1943 O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
Jews O
were O
practically O
non O
- O
existent O
: O
the O
work B-TER
was O
just O
too O
difficult O
for O
them O
and O
they O
were O
often O
taken O
straight O
from O
their O
place O
of O
work B-TER
, O
where O
they O
collapsed O
unconscious O
, O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

The O
internal B-TER
administration I-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
namely O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
the O
clothing B-TER
store O
, O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
kitchen B-TER
, O
delousing B-TER
etc O
. O

was O
put O
solely O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
prisoners B-TER
, O
who O
were O
selected O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
for O
this O
work B-TER
. O

Some O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
misused O
their O
preferential O
treatment O
, O
above O
all O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Kapos B-TER
, O
who O
were O
responsible O
for O
the O
labour B-TER
units I-TER
. O

They O
were O
often O
German B-LOC
, O
non O
- O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
, O
who O
were O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
for O
one O
of O
the O
following O
reasons O
: O
refusal O
to O
work B-TER
, O
prostitution O
or O
repeat O
offenders O
. O

We O
often O
suffered O
more O
under O
these O
prisoners B-TER
than O
under O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
who O
at O
least O
concerned O
themselves O
with O
the O
internal O
affairs O
a O
little O
, O
whereas O
we O
relied O
on O
these O
prisoners B-TER
for O
matters O
of O
life O
and O
death B-TER
. O

They O
have O
the O
lives O
of O
lots O
of O
Jews O
, O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
on O
their O
conscience O
, O
as O
they O
wanted O
to O
distinguish O
themselves O
in O
front O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
by O
violence O
towards O
us O
. O

The O
mortality B-TER

in O
the O
camp B-TER
rose O
every O
winter O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
year O
- O
round O
typhus B-TER
epidemic B-TER
claimed O
a O
lot O
of O
victims B-TER
, O
as O
did O
dysentery B-TER
and O
finally O
exhaustion O
. O

Many O
committed O
suicide B-TER
by O
throwing O
themselves O
at O
the O
high O
- O
voltage O
barbed O
wire O
, O
on O
which O
they O
would O
hang O
for O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
until O
their O
bodies B-TER
were O
removed O
from O
the O
wire O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Every O
morning O
before O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
those O
who O
had O
died B-TER
overnight O
were O
laid O
out O
before O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
after O
they O
had O
been O
completely O
undressed B-TER
, O
then O
the O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
who O
were O
given O
their O
rapport O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
reported O
: O
two O
thousand O
standing O
, O
fifty O
dead B-TER
, O
two O
hundred O
sick B-TER
. O

The O
200 O
sick B-TER
prisoners B-TER
were O
then O
sent O
off O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Revier O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
the O
next O
step O
being O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

Before O
my O
arrival O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
before O
and O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
how O
, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
I O
stared O
disbelievingly O
at O
a O
pile O
of O
twisted O
limbs O
piled O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
, O
until O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
these O
were O
dead B-TER
women B-TER
. O

I O
soon O
got O
used O
to O
this O
sight O
, O
however O
and O
later O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
Leichenkommando B-TER
for O
a O
while O
, O
in O
which O
it O
was O
my O
responsibility O
to O
load O
the O
naked O
bodies B-TER
onto O
a O
cart O
, O
which O
would O
then O
be O
driven O
into O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
, O
for O
the O
individual O
people B-TER
, O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
being O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
the O
continual O
physical O
humiliation B-TER
and O
the O
sense O
of O
complete O
hopelessness O
in O
facing O
their O
future O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
had O
no O
fear B-TER
left O
of O
being O
gassed B-TER
and O
hoped O
to O
die B-TER
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
still O
believed O
in O
God B-TER
prayed B-TER
every O
evening O
: O
Dear O
God O
, O
let O
us O
not O
wake O
up O
tomorrow O
. O

No O
, O
the O
worst O
was O
to O
stand O
still O
, O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
, O
morning O
and O
evening O
in O
the O
piercing O
cold O
, O
and O
in O
summer O
in O
sweltering O
heat O
, O
until O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
accounted O
for O
. O

Almost O
all O
of O
us O
suffered O
from O
chronic O
, O
bleeding B-TER
dysentery I-TER
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
go O
to O
the O
latrines B-TER
during O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

The O
consequences O
of O
this O
ban O
were O
unavoidable O
and O
it O
was O
this O
degrading O
humiliation B-TER
that O
was O
a O
greater O
agony O
for O
many O
of O
us O
than O
the O
constantly O
smoking O
chimneys O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
in O
front O
of O
us O
. O

It O
was O
the O
realisation O
that O
we O
had O
all O
lost O
every O
sign O
of O
civilisation O
in O
a O
frighteningly O
short O
space O
of O
time O
. O

We O
did O
not O
wash B-TER
any O
more O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
water B-TER
, O
it O
was O
so O
icy O
cold O
and O
we O
were O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
, O
we O
stank B-TER
, O
our O
whole O
bodies O
were O
festering B-TER
, O
we O
threw O
ourselves O
like O
wild O
animals O
at O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
we O
drank B-TER
the O
water B-TER
from O
dirty O
puddles O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
first O
Hungarian B-LOC
transport B-TER
of O
Jews O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

They O
arrived O
in O
such O
numbers O
that O
the O
crematorium B-TER
could O
no O
longer O
cope O
with O
the O
workload O
. O

We O
had O
to O
shovel O
enormous O
pits O
near O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

Those O
who O
had O
been O
gassed B-TER
were O
covered O
in O
petrol O
there O
and O
burnt B-TER
out I-TER
in O
the O
open O
. O

Small O
children B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
flames O
alive O
. O

We O
could O
hear O
their O
screams O
right O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
on O
command O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
the O
entire O
gypsy B-TER
camp B-TER
, O
which O
was O
next O
to O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
was O
exterminated B-TER
. O

Nobody O
survived B-TER
. O

They O
were O
all O
gassed B-TER
, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
perfectly O
healthy B-TER
young O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
in O
this O
camp B-TER
. O

Shortly O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
last O
Hungarian B-LOC
transport B-TER
, O
the O
evacuation B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
began O
, O
as O
the O
Russian B-LOC
front B-TER
was O
advancing O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
. O

The O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
were O
blown O
up O
, O
so O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
would O
not O
find O
them O
. O

On O
10th O
October O
1944 O
, O
I O
left O
the O
camp B-TER
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
with O
my O
sister O
and O
arrived O
a O
week O
later O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
of O
Belsen B-LOC
, O
after O
an O
eventful O
journey O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
wagon I-TER
. O

On O
15th O
April O
1945 O
we O
were O
released B-TER
by O
the O
English B-LOC

invasion B-TER
of O
Prague B-LOC

the O

Robert B-PER
K. I-PER
killed B-TER
himself O
by O
throwing O
himself O
down O
the O
staircase O
of O
his O

R. B-PER
K. I-PER
had O
been O
arranging O
his O
emigration B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
since O
the O
Munich B-LOC
Agreement O
, O
but O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
quickly O
enough O
. O

The O

from O
the O
Home O
Office O
had O
not O
gone O
through O
in O
February O
, O
as O
was O
expected O
. O

As O
K. B-PER
was O
associated O
with O
the O
Czech B-LOC
government B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
with O
the O
Petschekbank B-LOC
, O
This O
likely O
refers O
to O
the O
Petschek O
Palace O
, O
though O
uncertain O
of O
the O
context O
( O
e.g. O
why O
an O
association O
would O
make O
R.K O
a O
target O
of O
the O
Nazis O
) O
. O

his O
suicide B-TER
was O
pre O
- O
emptive O
; O
he O
would O
have O
met O
the O
same O
fate O
shortly O
after O
. O

Three O
days O
later O
, O
his O
82 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
mother O
died B-TER
too O
. O

The O
two O
older O
children B-ORG
were O
in O
England B-LOC
. O

The O
youngest O
, O
Gertrud B-PER
, O
went O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
school B-TER
that O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Nazis O
in O
March O
, O
and O
had O
to O
do O
her O
Abitur B-TER
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
their O
mother O
had O
tried O
everything O
to O
arrange O
emigration B-TER
for O
her O
and O
Gertrud B-PER
. O

The O
entry O
papers O
from O
England B-LOC
arrived O
shortly O
after O
K B-PER

. I-PER

death B-TER
. O

But O
the O
emigration B-TER
visa B-TER
from O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities B-TER
could O
not O
be O
obtained O
. O

The O
difficulties O
mounted O
up O
. O

Finally O
, O
her O
friends O
gave O
her O
the O
address O
of O
a O
young O
secretary O
who O
had O
helped O
her O
boss O
to O
emigrate B-TER
, O
as O
she O
had O
connections O
with O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
middle O
- O
man O
. O

This O
secretary O
, O
Fritzi O
, O
introduced O
her O
to O
Fritz B-PER
Smetana I-PER
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
, O
he O
assured O
her O
that O
she O
should O
not O
worry O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
the O
Chief O
at O
the O
Bank O
( O
code O
word O
for O
Gestapo B-ORG
) O
, O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
an O
understanding O
, O
and O
he O
had O
promised O
him O
everything O
for O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Fritzi O
added O
that O
she O
had O
spoken O
with O
Mr. O
Schubert B-PER
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
boss O
; O
he O
wanted O
a O
new O
car O
, O
but O
had O
not O
got O
the O
money B-TER
together O
for O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
said O
to O
him O
that O
he O
could O
have O
it O
, O
but O
first O
he O
had O
get O
the O
two O
ladies O
out O
. O

The O
attempts O
to O
leave O
had O
begun O
on O
the O
9th O
June O
1939 O
, O
when O
the O
English B-LOC
visa B-TER
had O
arrived O
. O

First O
, O
one O
needed O
a O
doctor B-TER
’s I-TER
note O
for O
a O
stay O
in O
Karlsbad B-LOC
, O
which O
the O
police B-TER
doctor B-TER
issued O
, O
with O
an O
objective O
reason O
. O

But O
, O
on O
the O
next O
day O
, O
Neurath B-PER
’s I-PER
orders B-TER
were O
announced O
without O
warning O
. O

( O
Travel B-TER
restrictions I-TER
etc O
. O

, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
Nuremberg B-LOC
Laws B-TER
) O
. O

The O
former O
head O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
Freiherr B-PER
von I-PER
Dürren I-PER
, O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
then O
came O
the O
Bank O
Holidays O
, O
when O
all O
the O
offices O
were O
closed O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
it O
became O
July O
. O

The O
promised O
emigration B-TER
was O
delayed O
again O
, O
because O
original O
copies O
of O
the O
baptism B-TER
certificates O
had O
to O
be O
submitted O
. O

( O
The O
baptism B-TER
had O
only O
recently O
been O
performed O
. O

It O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
us O
to O
get O
a O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
) O
. O

This O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
expired O
on O
15th O
July O
. O

The O
date O
of O
the O
baptism B-TER
was O
written O
illegibly O
, O
so O
the O
Priest B-TER
had O
to O
re O
- O
write O
it O
. O

Then O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
caused O
some O
further O
difficulties O
. O

Nobody O
, O
except O
for O
the O
mother O
’s O
parents O
, O
was O
allowed O
to O
know O
about O
the O
intended O
journey O
. O

On O
the O
6th O
July O
, O
Fritz O
informed O
them O
that O
he O
had O
to O
produce O
another O
tax B-TER
exemption O
form O
, O
but O
this O
would O
take O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Did O
they O
have O
any O
friends O
in O
Holland B-LOC
? O
Because O
the O
route O
through O
Slovakia B-LOC
would O
be O
quite O
a O
challenge O
. O

On O
6th O
July O
, O
Fritz B-PER
and O
Fritzi O
met O
them O
with O
long O
faces O
: O
the O
journey O
through O
Germany B-LOC
, O
to O
Holland B-LOC
, O
would O
unfortunately O
not O
be O
possible O
, O
a O
tax B-TER
exemption O
form O
was O
required O
and O
, O
although O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
buy O
these O
, O
that O
would O
certainly O
take O
too O
long O
as O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
would O
expire O
. O

Do O
not O
worry O
, O
we O
will O
travel O
through O
Slovakia O
. O

A O
friend O
, O
a O
LithuanianJournalist O
, O
is O
coming O
to O
collect O
me O
. O

Bring O
a O
small O
suitcase O
. O

On O
the O
following O
Sunday O
evening O
, O
Fritz B-PER
came O
back O
– O
everything O
was O
in O
order O
, O
they O
would O
travel O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
tomorrow O
to O
collect O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
, O
they O
should O
meet O
in O
the O
evening O
in O
Brünn B-LOC
. O

We O
will O
give O
you O
addresses O
for O
where O
you O
can O
stay B-TER
privately O
overnight O
, O
then O
you O
need O
to O
travel O
straight O
to O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
your O
friends O
will O
lend O
you O
the O
money B-TER
for O
the O
flights O
to O
London B-LOC
. O

( O
Which O
could O
obviously O
not O
be O
purchased O
in O
Prague B-LOC
) O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
Smetana B-PER
did O
not O
receive O
the O
passports B-TER
that O
he O
had O
been O
promised O
. O

Herr O
Schubert O
is O
of O
course O
furious O
that O
I O
was O
n’t O
sent O
the O
passports O
, O
and O
is O
trying O
everything O
he O
can O
to O
get O
them O
. O

Mother O
and O
daughter O
waited O
all O
day O
for O
the O
call O
to O
say O
when O
Fritz B-PER
could O
set O
off O
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
should O
leave O
the O
following O
morning O
, O
and O
go O
to O
Hodonin B-LOC
, O
a O
village O
on O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
. O

There O
, O
they O
should O
meet O
Smetana B-PER
in O
a O
guesthouse B-TER
opposite O
the O
station O
. O

Fritzi O
, O
who O
delivered O
this O
message O
, O
went O
on O
to O
explain O
that O
Smetana B-PER
had O
called O
her O
from O
her O
bed O
at O
10 O
pm O
, O
because O
he O
needed O
money B-TER
in O
order O
to O
purchase O
the O
necessary O
Pengö B-TER
and O
Marks B-TER
from O
the O
waiter O
at O
Hotel B-TER
Sroubek O
. O

After O
11 O
pm O
, O
he O
called O
again O
to O
say O
that O
he O
was O
already O
over O
the O
town O
border O
. O

The O
day O
was O
spent O
saying O
farewells O
, O
packing O
a O
few O
things O
and O
trying O
to O
put O
the O
house B-TER
in O
order O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
without O
making O
it O
known O
that O
they O
were O
planning O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
a O
long O
distance O
call O
from O
Luhacovice B-LOC
surprised O
them O
, O
which O
she O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
take O
at O
first O
, O
Fritz B-PER
called O
, O
he O
had O
the O
emigration B-TER
papers O
, O
he O
just O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Bratislava B-LOC
to O
get O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
. O

Everything O
else O
was O
going O
as O
planned O
. O

Shortly O
after O
5 O
am O
, O
they O
left O
the O
house B-TER
. O

The O
( O
Czech B-LOC
) O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
they O
had O
wanted O
to O
avoid O
, O
came O
out O
to O
wish O
them O
luck O
, O
her O
only O
son O
had O
also O
left O
, O
to O
Batavia O
. O

The O
journey O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
passed O
without O
further O
incident O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
on O
to O
Hodonin B-LOC
on O
a O
slow O
train B-TER
. O

The O
Guesthouse B-TER
opposite O
the O
station O
bore O
a O
large O
sign O
saying O
: O
Attention O

Jewish B-TER
Business I-TER
. O

In O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
, O
old O
men B-TER
sat O
around O
playing O
cards O
. O

The O
mother B-TER
and O

ordered O

Fritz B-PER
was O
supposed O

at O
four O
o’clock O

went O

then O
it O
was O

Suddenly O
, O
Fritz B-PER
came O
and O
sat O
himself O
down O
at O
their O

Milady O
, O
I O
’ve O
got O
the O
tickets O
for O
the O
outward O
journey O
, O
but O
the O
Hungarianvisa O
was O
not O
put O
on O
the O
passports O
that O
I O
have O
here O
( O
i.e. O
have O
received O
the O
identity O
documents O
) O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
travel O
to O
Prague O
again O
– O
then O
you O
will O
travel O
to O
Luhacovice O
, O
to O
meet O
my O
uncle O
, O
and O
wait O
there O
for O
me O
. O

But O
now O
I O
have O
to O
meet O
the O
gentlemen O
here O
, O
so O
I O
will O
come O
back O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
a O
blonde O
woman O
will O
come O
over O
to O
you O
, O
she O
’s O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
Gestapoman O
, O
give O
her O
the O
money O
that O
you O
have O
with O
you O
. O

She O
is O
completely O
trustworthy O
. O

Before O
we O
could O
ask O
any O
questions O
, O
he O
left O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
along O
came O
a O
very O
blonde O
, O
plump O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
and O
began O
to O
talk O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
I O
slid O
the O
money B-TER
over O
to O
her O
under O
the O
newspaper B-TER
that O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
table O
, O
she O
took O
it O
and O
disappeared O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
hide O
it O
, O
then O
she O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
her O
husband O
was O
a O
musical B-TER
director O
who O
was O
now O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
explained O
other O
things O
; O
she O
seemed O
fairly O
well O
- O
informed O
. O

Then O
Fritz O
returned O
. O

Everything O
is O
organised O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
owns O
a O
cinema O
, O
he O
has O
a O
cinema O
here O
, O
another O
in O
Holíč O
, O
that O
is O
the O
next O
village O
, O
over O
the O
Slovakian O
border O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
, O
he O
can O
travel O
back O
and O
forth O
over O
the O
border O
as O
he O
pleases O
. O

We O
’ll O
get O
a O
taxi O
to O
the O
marketplace O
now O
and O
wait O
for O
him O
there O
, O
and O
he O
will O
take O
you O
over O
the O
border O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
bringing O
me O
your O
passports O
, O
I O
will O
take O
them O
to O
Prague O
for O
the O
visa O
, O
and O
then O
bring O
them O
back O
for O
you O
. O

Then O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
taxi O
and O
waited O
. O

A O
man B-TER
came O
along O
and O
greeted O
Fritz B-PER
; O
that O
was O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
journalist B-TER
, O
he O
got O
into O
the O
car O
too O
and O
the O
two O
men B-TER
chatted O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
to O
gradually O
get O
nervous O
. O

Every O
second O
, O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
drove O
past O
on O
motorbikes O
. O

Lots O
of O
other O
vehicles O
came O
past O
too O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
small O
, O
grey O
Tatra O
( O
Czech B-LOC
car O
brand O
) O
came O
along O
and O
stopped O
a O
few O
metres O
away O
. O

A O
man B-TER
got O
out O
, O
and O
Fritz B-PER
and O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
went O
over O
to O
him O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
three O
men B-TER
appeared O
to O
negotiate O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

Fritz O
came O
back O
, O
got O
into O
the O
car O
and O
told O
the O
driver O
he O
should O
drive O
right O
up O
to O
the O
other O
car O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
us O
two O
exit O
passes B-TER
( O
the O
pink O
tickets O
for O
so O
- O
called O
‘ O
small O
border O
traffic O
’ O
, O
which O
permitted O
the O
holders O
to O
travel O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
border O
areas O
, O
for O
work O
purposes O
, O
for O
the O
day O
. O

) O
Everything O
is O
organised O
. O

Now O
we O
will O
drive O
to O
a O
hotel O
, O
where O
we O
must O
swap O
the O
car O
as O
inconspicuously O
as O
possible O
. O

In O
front O
of O
the O
hotel B-TER
entrance O
stood O
the O
other O
car O
, O
with O
its O
bonnet O
facing O
us O
. O

The O
men B-TER
– O
there O
were O
two O
of O
them O
– O
went O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
, O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
went O
too O
, O
then O
came O
a O
porter O
who O
took O
our O
luggage O
out O
of O
the O
taxi O
and O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
the O
Porter O
carried O
our O
suitcase O
out O
of O
the O
building O
and O
to O
the O
other O
car O
. O

Then O
, O
Mother B-TER
and O
I O
got O
out O
This O
sentence O
ends O
with O
… O
schaute O
und O
Geschafte O
an O
, O
which O
does O
n’t O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
meaning O
– O
perhaps O
it O
is O
a O
mistake O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
waited O
for O
long O
enough O
, O
we O
got O
into O
the O
Tatra O
car O
, O
into O
which O
they O
had O
put O
our O
suitcases O
. O

It O
got O
dark O
. O

Fritz B-PER
Smetana I-PER
said O
goodbye O
, O
giving O
us O
lots O
of O
assurance O
. O

Then O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
came O
along O
and O
started O
looking O
for O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
turning O
every O
bit O
of O
paper O
lying O
on O
the O
street O
over O
with O
his O
foot O
, O
said O
Everything O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
went O
back O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
. O

Then O
we O
waited O
. O

Finally O
, O
three O
men B-TER
came O
out O
of O
the O
hotel B-TER
: O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
, O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
left O
straight O
away O
, O
and O
the O
third O
man B-TER
, O
who O
must O
have O
been O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
. O

He O
did O
n’t O
look O
that O
bad O
, O
quite O
a O
young O
guy O
. O

The O
German B-LOC
produced O
our O
papers O
, O
he O
already O
had O
the O
border O
ticket O
and O
the O
passports B-TER
, O
and O
said O
that O
we O
should O
n’t O
worry O
and O
we O
should O
only O
speak O
if O
we O
were O
asked O
questions O
. O

So O
finally O
we O
set O
off O
. O

After O
ten O
minutes O
, O
a O
barrier O
was O
laid O
down O
on O
the O
road O
, O
we O
were O
trapped O
at O
the O
border O
. O

The O
barrier O
was O
taken O
up O
, O
we O
drove O
through O
, O
and O
it O
was O
laid O
down O
again O
directly O
after O
we O
had O
passed O
. O

Now O
there O
was O
no O
going O
back O
anymore O
. O

In O
front O
of O
us O
was O
a O
big O
, O
elegant O
car O
and O
the O
passengers O
came O
out O
of O
the O
border O
office O
, O
and O
put O
individual O
pieces O
of O
their O
expensive O
clothing B-TER
back O
into O
the O
car O
. O

That O
implied O
a O
very O
thorough O
border O
examination O
. O

Your O
passports O
please O
, O
a O
German B-LOC
voice O
said O
, O
and O
suddenly O
a O
German B-LOC
soldier B-TER
was O
standing O
before O
us O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
on O
the O
Czechoslovakian B-LOC
border O
, O
there O
were O
no O
Czech B-LOC
officials O
anywhere O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

Our O
Gestapo B-ORG
men B-TER
took O
the O
passports B-TER
out O
of O
the O
car O
. O

Today O
I O
have O
two O
ladies O
with O
me O
too O
, O
he O
said O
, O
casually O
. O

How O
much O
money O
do O
they O
have O
? O
Thirty O
koruna O
, O
the O
two O
of O
us O
said O
. O

Check O
the O
handbags O
, O
suggests O
a O
small O
, O
unsympathetic O
man B-TER
to O
our O
soldiers B-TER
. O

I O
took O
mine O
our O
first O
, O
he O
looked O
through O
all O
the O
pockets O
, O
finally O
he O
got O
to O
the O
small O
purse O
, O
in O
which O
I O
kept O
both O
suitcase O
keys O
, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
a O
polite O
manner O
. O

He O
only O
asked O
whether O
I O
had O
these O
suitcases O
in O
the O
car O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
bag O
back O
to O
me O
, O
then O
afterwards O
he O
searched O
Mutzi O
’s O
bag O
, O
checked O
our O
permits O
to O
travel O
across O
the O
border O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
over O
the O
bridge O
to O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
office O
. O

With O
the O
border O
officials O
there O
, O
our O
two O
companions O
just O
made O
silly O
jokes O
, O
showed O
our O
passes B-TER
, O
then O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
shone O
a O
bright O
torch O
at O
us O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
on O
into O
Slovakian B-LOC
land O
. O

So O
, O
we O
are O
over O
the O
border O
said O
our O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
. O

Mutzi O
let O
out O
a O
breath O
and O
I O
felt O
much O
lighter O
. O

I O
wondered O
whether O
we O
were O
away O
from O
the O
Nazis O
forever O
now O
. O

We O
drove O
on O
for O
about O
another O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
on O
a O
very O
pretty O
road O
to O
Holíč B-LOC
, O
the O
next O
village O
. O

There O
, O
we O
stopped O
outside O
the O
only O
guesthouse B-TER
in O
this O
tiny O
village O
, O
and O
got O
out O
of O
the O
car O
. O

So O
, O
you O
must O
stay O
here O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
passports O
, O
which O
I O
can O
hopefully O
bring O
back O
for O
you O
as O
early O
as O
tomorrow O
, O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
said O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
took O
my O
bracelet O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
and O
some O
money B-TER
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
us O
, O
then O
he O
booked O
a O
room B-TER
for O
us O
and O
went O
into O
the O
guesthouse B-TER
with O
us O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
dreaming O
. O

Did O
that O
really O
all O
happen O
? O
While O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
our O
evening O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
chatted O
to O
our O
travelling O
companions O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
say O
one O
more O
thing O
to O
you O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
said O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
you O
are O
very O
near O
the O
border O
and O
border O
surveillance O
is O
patrolling O
constantly O
, O
so O
show O
yourselves O
in O
public O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
otherwise O
you O
might O
attract O
attention O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
would O
be O
to O
stay O
in O
your O
room O
. O

As O
identification O
, O
you O
have O
the O
permit O
to O
cross O
the O
border O
with O
you O
, O
and O
if O
anyone O
happens O
to O
ask O
, O
though O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
that O
no O
one O
will O
, O
then O
say O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
my O
sister O
’s O
wedding O
, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
here O
because O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
car O
. O

My O
sister O
’s O
name O
is O
Soundse O
, O
and O
she O
lives O
two O
villages O
on O
. O

You O
know O
, O
today O
I O
was O
really O
sweating O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
sitting O
on O
hot O
coals O
, O
and O
when O
I O
feel O
like O
that O
, O
then O
it O
really O
means O
something O
. O

And O
then O
he O
asked O
Mutzi O
: O
What O
did O
you O
take O
out O
of O
your O
bag O
while O
the O
official O
was O
searching O
your O
daughter O
? O
I O
did O
see O
you O
do O
it O
, O
lucky O
that O
the O
official O
did O
n’t O
see O
, O
because O
you O
know O
, O
if O
they O
get O
suspicious O
then O
things O
really O
do O
get O
difficult O
. O

Mutzi O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
Franc B-TER
, O
which O
she O
had O
happened O
to O
find O
in O
her O
bag O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
left O
it O
in O
the O
car O
. O

But O
, O
anyway O
, O
we O
had O
got O
through O
alright O
. O

The O
German B-LOC
went O
on O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
that O
he O
had O
driven O
through O
the O
whole O
previous O
night O
to O
get O
us O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

Then O
, O
he O
told O
us O
again O
not O
to O
repeat O
anything O
that O
he O
had O
told O
us O
. O

You O
see O
, O
we O
want O
to O
go O
on O
to O
help O
others O
too O
. O

He O
came O
from O
Bavaria B-LOC
, O
and O
really O
was O
a O
nice O
man B-TER
. O

The O
other O
man B-TER
promised O
us O
he O
would O
give O
the O
passports B-TER
to O
Fritz B-PER
straight O
away O
, O
so O
he O
could O
set O
off O
for O
Prague B-LOC
that O
evening O
and O
aim O
to O
be O
back O
by O
the O
following O
evening O
. O

And O
then O
they O
said O
their O
goodbyes O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
left O
sitting O
there O
, O
in O
the O
little O
Slovakian B-LOC
village O
, O
we O
ate O
a O
little O
something O
again O
and O
told O
the O
landlord O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
have O
tomorrow O
’s O
meals B-TER
delivered O
to O
our O
room B-TER
, O
and O
then O
we O
went O
upstairs O
. O

The O
room B-TER
looked O
nice O
and O
clean O
, O
and O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
we O
hoped O
to O
only O
have O
to O
stay O
there O
for O
one O
night O
. O

It O
had O
become O
quite O
late O
and O
we O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
had O
certainly O
been O
through O
enough O
that O
day O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
tired O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
could O
sleep O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
tell O
each O
other O
this O
, O
as O
neither O
of O
us O
wanted O
to O
disturb O
the O
other O
, O
but O
, O
as O
we O
lay O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
the O
situation O
first O
began O
to O
sink O
in O
for O
me O
properly O
. O

Now O
, O
we O
were O
over O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
, O
without O
passports B-TER
, O
with O
only O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
money B-TER
, O
relying O
completely O
on O
the O
honesty O
of O
two O
strange O
men B-TER
; O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
Fritz B-PER
did O
n’t O
get O
the O
visa B-TER
, O
if O
they O
did O
n’t O
bring O
us O
the O
passports B-TER
, O
if O
someone O
here O
suspected O
, O
etc O
. O

etc O
… O
Mutzi O
was O
probably O
wondering O
about O
exactly O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
both O
got O
up O
cheerfully O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
mentioned O
any O
of O
our O
worries O
, O
but O
instead O
reminded O
each O
other O
how O
good O
it O
was O
that O
we O
were O
over O
the O
border O
, O
and O
that O
Fritz B-PER
would O
hopefully O
take O
us O
over O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
border O
that O
evening O
, O
as O
he O
had O
promised O
. O

In O
my O
head O
, O
I O
kept O
trying O
to O
calculate O
the O
distance O
between O
Hodonin B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
had O
a O
shock O
when O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
what O
a O
huge O
distance O
it O
was O
. O

Maybe O
Fritz B-PER
had O
not O
been O
seen O
straight O
away O
at O
the O
embassy B-TER
– O
but O
there O
was O
no O
point O
in O
thinking O
about O
that O
so O
much O
. O

After O
breakfast B-TER
we O
sorted O
some O
things O
out O
, O
and O
then O
we O
had O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
. O

Mutzi O
, O
we O
wo O
n’t O
decide O
anything O
now O
– O
we O
can O
see O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
money O
tomorrow O
, O
when O
we O
’re O
on O
the O
train O
, O
I O
said O
. O

So O
, O
we O
went O
downstairs O
to O
see O
the O
hotel B-TER
manager O
, O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
we O
were O
leaving O
early O
and O
to O
ask O
whether O
we O
could O
be O
driven O
to O
the O
station O
. O

We O
paid O
our O
bill O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

Or O
, O
more O
accurately O
, O
we O
laid O
down O
and O
began O
to O
try O
and O
decide O
what O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
tomorrow O
would O
be O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
did O
not O
tell O
each O
other O
of O
our O
concerns O
, O
instead O
we O
both O
tried O
to O
convince O
ourselves O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

It O
was O
all O
quite O
ridiculous O
– O
Mutzi O
and O
I O
were O
really O
lying O
in O
a O
tiny O
hotel B-TER
in O
Holíč B-LOC
, O
( O
naturally O
, O
I O
had O
never O
heard O
the O
name O
of O
this O
place O
before O
in O
my O
life O
) O
on O
the O
run B-TER
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
our O
home B-TER
– O
but O
on O
our O
way O
to O
Fietz O
and O
Lisinka O
( O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
as O
mentioned O
earlier O
in O
the O
report O
) O
Slightly O
unclear O
here O
, O
though O
it O
seems O
Fietz O
and O
Lisinka O
are O
likely O
the O
friends O
in O
Hungary O
mentioned O
on O
page O
2 O
, O
I O
had O
to O
keep O
reminding O
myself O
of O
that O
, O
as O
it O
helped O
me O
to O
regain O
my O
courage O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
there O
was O
no O
going O
back O
for O
us O
anymore O
, O
as O
we O
had O
finally O
got O
over O
the O
border O
. O

Why O
should O
n’t O
we O
take O
the O
money B-TER
with O
us O
, O
anyway O
? O
It O
was O
our O
property B-TER
, O
and O
we O
had O
had O
to O
leave O
everything O
else O
behind O
, O
and O
why O
– O
just O
because O
one O
man B-TER
had O
gone O
crazy O
and O
wanted O
to O
take O
over O
the O
world O
. O

and O
had O
cause O
more O
harm O
than O
you O
could O
even O
comprehend O
. O

When O
I O
thought O
about O
that O
; O
that O
we O
had O
to O
smuggle B-TER
money B-TER
illegally B-TER
across O
the O
border O
, O
I O
got O
quite O
worked O
up O
– O
but O
it O
really O
was O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

Let O
’s O
worry O
about O
that O
later O
– O
it O
’s O
still O
a O
whole O
day O
away O
, O
and O
we O
can O
wait O
until O
then O
to O
see O
what O
we O
’ll O
have O
to O
do O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
hotel B-TER
manager O
drove O
us O
to O
the O
station O
. O

We O
were O
very O
early O
for O
the O
train B-TER
, O
and O
so O
I O
watched O
the O
people B-TER
who O
were O
there O
waiting O
for O
the O
train B-TER
with O
us O
. O

It O
was O
simple O
farm O
folk O
, O
who O
all O
looked O
so O
good O
- O
natured O
and O
chatted O
pleasantly O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Maybe O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
I O
would O
gladly O
have O
swapped O
places O
with O
them O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
nervous O
that O
we O
would O
stand O
out O
there O
, O
and O
if O
a O
man O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
us O
twice O
, O
I O
thought O
he O
might O
be O
spying O
on O
us O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
train B-TER
was O
delayed O
, O
it O
had O
certainly O
been O
stopped O
at O
the O
border O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
came O
, O
and O
we O
set O
off O
with O
three O
stops O
and O
no O
notable O
events O
or O
issues O
to O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
we O
gave O
in O
our O
bag O
and O
went O
into O
the O
city O
. O

The O
city O
itself O
is O
quite O
beautiful O
, O
especially O
the O
Danube B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
very O
wide O
there O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
about O
midday O
. O

First O
, O
we O
bought O
our O
tickets O
, O
actually O
, O
we O
booked O
them O
, O
as O
we O
could O
n’t O
pick O
them O
up O
until O
the O
afternoon O
, O
and O
then O
we O
went O
to O
go O
and O
have O
lunch B-TER
. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
somewhere O
nice O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
using O
the O
last O
of O
our O
money B-TER
, O
as O
who O
knew O
whether O
we O
would O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
again O
. O

So O
, O
we O
made O
our O
way O
to O
the O
Carlton O
, O
the O
best O
hotel B-TER
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

After O
wondering O
around O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
asking O
some O
people B-TER
, O
we O
finally O
got O
there O
. O

It O
was O
really O
nice O
, O
the O
company O
was O
very O
mixed O
, O
partly O
good O
foreign O
people B-TER
, O
and O
partly O
Nazis O
. O

After O
the O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
went O
to O
pick O
up O
our O
tickets O
, O
and O
then O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
and O
have O
a O
coffee B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
use O
up O
all O
our O
time O
somewhere O
, O
so O
after O
we O
had O
walked O
around O
the O
square O
twice O
, O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
we O
went O
into O
the O
first O
, O
best O
café B-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
a O
Nazi O
café B-TER
, O
which O
we O
noticed O
, O
to O
our O
shock O
. O

But O
we O
stayed O
there O
anyway O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
the O
Nazis O
but O
, O
there O
, O
we O
had O
to O
go O
into O
a O
café B-TER
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
favourite O
meeting O
- O
place O
for O
Nazis O
. O

German B-LOC
newspapers B-TER
everywhere O
, O
the O
Völkischer O
Beobachter O
etc O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
mother B-TER
said O
You O
know O
, O
we O
should O
really O
still O
try O
and O
get O
some O
Pengö O
, O
I O
think O
the O
Carlton O
would O
be O
the O
most O
likely O
place O
to O
have O
them O
So O
, O
we O
went O
back O
once O
again O
and O
asked O
the O
porter O
, O
naturally O
he O
did O
not O
have O
any O
Pengö B-TER
, O
but O
in O
the O
travel O
office O
there O
we O
could O
get O
30 O
Pengö B-TER
, O
we O
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
take O
more O
with O
us O
, O
apparently O
. O

When O
the O
man B-TER
there O
saw O
our O
Czech B-LOC
passes B-TER
, O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
how O
we O
had O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
, O
and O
went O
on O
to O
tell O
us O
how O
he O
had O
tried O
hard O
to O
get O
his O
family B-TER
out O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
proved O
completely O
impossible O
. O

Then O
it O
was O
five O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
which O
meant O
we O
still O
had O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

We O
definitely O
had O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
some O
black O
cloth B-TER
, O
as O
Smetana B-PER
had O
advised O
. O

So O
we O
went O
to O
the O
Jewish O
quarter O
. O

It O
looked O
terrible O
there O
, O
many O
of O
the O
shops B-TER
were O
completely O
locked O
up O
, O
the O
others O
were O
half O
empty O
and O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
shop B-TER
that O
was O
not O
damaged O
. O

On O
every O
single O
one O
, O
there O
was O
some O
kind O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
inscription I-TER
, O
and O
some O
were O
wrecked O
. O

We O
went O
inside O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
people B-TER
there O
were O
so O
unhappy O
and O
depressed O
and O
tried O
to O
offer O
us O
all O
their O
wares O
. O

After O
we O
had O
got O
the O
piece O
of O
cloth B-TER
, O
we O
went O
to O
a O
coffee B-TER
house I-TER
again O
, O
this O
time O
a O
very O
nationalist B-TER
Czech B-LOC
one O
, O
which O
was O
decidedly O
more O
comfortable O
. O

We O
still O
had O
about O
a O
hundred O
Koruna B-TER
left O
over O
, O
which O
we O
wanted O
to O
spent O
, O
as O
we O
could O
not O
take O
them O
with O
us O
. O

So O
we O
looked O
around O
the O
shops B-TER
a O
bit O
more O
, O
but O
most O
of O
them O
were O
already O
closed O
and O
so O
we O
did O
not O
buy O
anything O
more O
at O
all O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
station O
and O
had O
a O
larger O
dinner O
there O
, O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
some O
more O
of O
the O
money B-TER
. O

Mutzi O
wanted O
simply O
to O
throw O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
away O
, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
give O
it O
to O
the O
guard O
. O

We O
bought O
some O
cigarettes O
for O
Friedl O
, O
and O
a O
book B-TER
, O
then O
boarded O
the O
train B-TER
. O

It O
was O
not O
as O
empty O
as O
we O
had O
predicted O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
empty O
compartment B-TER
, O
which O
we O
headed O
straight O
into O
, O
but O
what O
should O
we O
do O
with O
the O
money B-TER
now O
? O
Mutzi O
still O
had O
it O
in O
her O
jacket B-TER
and O
was O
going O
to O
throw O
it O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
but O
a O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
official O
suddenly O
appeared O
before O
us O
and O
asked O
how O
much O
money B-TER
we O
had O
with O
us O
. O

We O
had O
not O
expected O
Bratislava B-LOC
to O
be O
so O
near O
the O
border O
, O
what O
should O
we O
do O
now O
? O
Ja O
' O
ale O
ješte O
mi O
30 O
korun O
sebou O
( O
I O
actually O
still O
have O
30 O
Kč B-TER
on O
me O
) O
said O
Mutzi O
, O
namely O
, O
the O
Czech B-LOC
money B-TER
that O
we O
still O
had O
with O
us O
. O

The O
officials O
were O
particularly O
nice O
, O
one O
was O
a O
very O
young O
solider B-TER
, O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
send O
the O
money B-TER
back O
to O
a O
Prague B-LOC
address O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
do O
that O
and O
offered O
it O
to O
them O
, O
which O
, O
naturally O
, O
they O
refused O
. O

After O
a O
long O
discussion O
, O
we O
agreed O
that O
we O
would O
deposit O
it O
with O
them O
. O

Až O
se O
vrátí O
mužete O
si O
pro O
to O
přijít O
( O
When O
you O
return O
, O
you O
can O
collect O
it O
) O
… O
And O
then O
they O
left O
, O
the O
train B-TER
travelled O
onwards O
and O
nothing O
else O
happened O
, O
I O
had O
expected O
that O
the O
officials O
would O
come O
back O
again O
, O
but O
only O
the O
Hungarians B-LOC
came O
along O
, O
and O
then O
we O
were O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

What O
should O
we O
do O
now O
? O
We O
stood O
by O
the O
window O
, O
behind O
the O
curtains O
, O
of O
course O
, O
so O
nobody O
could O
see O
us O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
residents O
. O

It O
was O
a O
long O
village O
road O
with O
very O
little O
traffic O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
a O
lorry O
or O
bicycle O
went O
by O
. O

Across O
from O
us O
was O
a O
small O
house B-TER
where O
it O
seemed O
that O
countless O
people B-TER
lived O
, O
as O
every O
other O
blink O
of O
the O
eye O
a O
different O
person O
appeared O
at O
the O
window O
. O

So O
, O
at O
least O
we O
had O
a O
little O
distraction O
. O

By O
the O
toilet O
in O
our O
guesthouse B-TER
there O
was O
a O
small O
balcony O
that O
overlooked O
a O
little O
garden O
, O
we O
went O
out O
there O
for O
some O
fresh O
air O
, O
because O
we O
mostly O
kept O
the O
window O
in O
our O
room B-TER
closed O
… O
today O
is O
the O
13th O
, O
in O
two O
days O
the O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
would O
run O
out O
, O
what O
then O
? O
We O
could O
n’t O
go O
back O
anymore O
. O

We O
ate B-TER
, O
stood O
at O
the O
window O
again O
and O
waited O
. O

After O
tea B-TER
, O
we O
saw O
the O
small O
car O
outside O
, O
it O
was O
really O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
, O
he O
got O
out O
and O
waved O
at O
us O
, O
came O
up O
, O
but O
he O
had O
not O
spoken O
to O
Fritz B-PER
yet O
, O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
see O
him O
. O

It O
was O
past O
9 O
o’clock O
when O
he O
knocked O
on O
our O
door O
. O

Everything O
is O
in O
order O
, O
said O
the O
Cinema O
- O
owner O
by O
way O
of O
greeting O
. O

Then O
he O
handed O
us O
the O
passports B-TER
and O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
Fritz B-PER
, O
then O
he O
wished O
us O
luck O
and O
said O
goodbye O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
also O
said O
that O
Fritz B-PER
could O
unfortunately O
not O
accompany O
us O
to O
the O
border O
, O
as O
he O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
Prague B-LOC
imminently O
. O

He O
also O
advised O
us O
to O
ask O
our O
host O
to O
drive O
to O
our O
train B-TER
early O
, O
so O
we O
would O
n’t O
have O
to O
drag O
our O
case O
there O
ourselves O
, O
as O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
long O
way O
away O
. O

Then O
Mutz O
and O
I O
went O
back O
to O
our O
room B-TER
and O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
read O
the O
letter B-TER
. O

Madams O
, O
I O
have O
enclosed O
the O
Hungarianvisa O
and O
some O
money O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
accompany O
you O
any O
further O
, O
as O
I O
have O
important O
things O
to O
take O
care O
of O
, O
but O
do O
not O
worry O
, O
everything O
will O
go O
smoothly O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
some O
10 O
Mark O
notes O
, O
take O
them O
with O
you O
. O

Tomorrow O
morning O
you O
will O
travel O
to O
Bratislava O
, O
unfortunately O
you O
will O
have O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
there O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
as O
your O
train O
to O
Budapest O
does O
not O
depart O
until O
after O
midnight O
. O

Get O
second O
- O
class O
tickets O
and O
, O
in O
Budapest O
, O
your O
friends O
will O
provide O
further O
help O
. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
get O
the O
money O
over O
the O
border O
will O
be O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
piece O
of O
dark O
- O
coloured O
cloth O
and O
hide O
it O
between O
the O
seats O
in O
an O
empty O
compartment O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O
will O
have O
any O
difficulty O
with O
this O
as O
the O
train O
will O
definitely O
be O
empty O
. O

So O
, O
do O
not O
worry O
, O
everything O
will O
go O
according O
to O
plan O
. O

You O
can O
retrieve O
the O
money O
at O
the O
border O
and O
exchange O
it O
in O
Budapest O
. O

I O
think O
that O
is O
all O
. O

Please O
destroy O
this O
letter O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
have O
read O
it O
. O

I O
ca O
n’t O
do O
this O
, O
Mutz O
said O
, O
in O
despair O
, O
he O
said O
he O
would O
get O
us O
safely O
across O
the O
border O
! O
I O
’ll O
try O
and O
get O
across O
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n’t O
do O
that O
thing O
with O
the O
money O
! O
Obviously O
, O
we O
had O
both O
envisioned O
it O
all O
quite O
differently O
, O
he O
had O
indeed O
promised O
us O
many O
times O
that O
he O
would O
take O
us O
over O
the O
border O
himself O
, O
and O
now O
he O
had O
just O
written O
a O
letter B-TER
saying O
we O
should O
smuggle B-TER
money B-TER
over O
the O
border O
– O
what O
were O
we O
paying O
him O
so O
much O
money B-TER
for O
; O
why O
had O
we O
given O
him O
such O
a O
large O
sum B-TER
the O
day O
before O
? O
But O
we O
had O
to O
get O
away O
from O
there O
, O
at O
any O
price O
, O
and O
we O
could O
not O
go O
back O
anymore O
. O

So O
, O
we O
really O
did O
not O
have O
a O
choice O

History O
of O
the O
Jews O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
When O
the O
first O
Jews O
arrived O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
early O
in O
1938 O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
still O
largely O
run O
by O
criminals B-TER
imprisoned B-TER
there O
who O
completely O
went O
along O
with O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
their O
methods O
. O

The O
Jews O
involved O
, O
all O
1,000 O
of O
them O
, O
were O
taken O
there O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
so O
- O
called O
campaign O
- O
that O
is O
, O
the O
authorities B-TER
had O
simply O
arrested B-TER
people B-TER
en O
masse O
in O
several O
towns O
so O
as O
to O
spread O
terror O
among O
the O
rest O
and O
force O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
and O
give O
up O
their O
property B-TER
. O

The O
people B-TER
who O
were O
pulled O
in O
came O
from O
the O
widest O
variety O
of O
groups O
in O
terms O
of O
age O
and O
social O
origin O
and O
were O
consequently O
unable O
to O
unite O
in O
response O
to O
their O
persecution B-TER
. O

They O
had O
to O
camp B-TER
out I-TER
in O
an O
unfurnished O
cowshed B-TER
, O
where O
they O
made O
do O
with O
300 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
a O
3/4 O
litre O
of O
watery O
soup B-TER
a O
day O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
overseeing O
them O
regularly O
cheated O
them O
even O
of O
this O
. O

Their O
working B-TER
time O
was O
around O
14 O
to O
15 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
and O
the O
living B-TER
conditions I-TER
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
… O
… O
. O

meant O
that O
they O
could O
only O
think O
of O
sleeping O
for O
around O
5 O
hours O
a O
night O
. O

As O
result O
of O
constant O
harassment O
and O
attacks B-TER
, O
especially O
in O
the O
quarry O
, O
three O
of O
four O
a O
day O
were O
systematically O
bullied O
into O
trying O
to O
run B-TER
through O
the O
cordon O
of O
guards B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
shot B-TER
for O
attempting O
to O
escape O
. O

Aside O
from O
a O
small O
number O
who O
were O
released B-TER
, O
all O
of O
them O
were O
murdered B-TER
apart O
from O
a O
remnant O
of O
twenty O
who O
are O
still O
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
today O
. O

On O
each O
of O
the O
23rd O
and O
the O
24th O
of O
September O
1938 O
around O
a O
thousand O
more O
Jews O
arrived O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
which O
now O
counted O
as O
a O
liquidation B-TER
camp B-TER
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
men B-TER
on O
both O
these O
transports B-TER
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
as O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
following O
the O
occupation B-TER
of O
Vienna B-LOC
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
mentioned O
above O
. O

Along O
with O
them O
though O
were O
some O
, O
partly O
long O
- O
term O
, O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
interned O
because O
of O
their O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
views O
. O

Over O
the O
following O
weeks O
and O
months O
, O
the O
struggle O
of O
these O
imprisoned B-TER
German B-LOC
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascists I-TER
reached O
its O
first O
high O
point O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
the O
overseers O
’ O
roles O
were O
purged O
of O
criminal B-TER
elements O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
found O
themselves O
in O
a O
position O
which O
was O
clearly O
more O
advantageous O
in O
that O
it O
led O
the O
Kommandant B-TER
to O
declare O
on O
30 O
January O
that O
prisoners B-TER
who O
oversaw O
the O
Jews O
would O
in O
future O
be O
Jews O
themselves O
. O

Later O
on O
these O
too O
came O
to O
include O
various O
negative O
and O
dangerous O
elements O
, O
but O
they O
were O
considerably O
easier O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
than O
if O
they O
had O
been O
so O
- O
called O
Aryans O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
way O
they O
were O
looked O
after O
and O
generally O
dealt O
with O
, O
and O
of O
their O
working B-TER
hours O
, O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
remained O
pariahs O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
the O
great O
number O
of O
deaths B-TER
among O
them O
over O
the O
following O
years O
must O
be O
traced O
to O
that O
. O

On O
9th O
November O
1938 O
over O
12,000 O
Jews O
entered O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Rath B-PER
campaign O
. O

As O
they O
came O
in O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
armed O
with O
clubs O
and O
whips O
, O
were O
lined O
up O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Weimar B-LOC
so O
that O
only O
a O
few O
Jews O
reached O
the O
camp B-TER
uninjured O
. O

The O
streets O
, O
strewn O
with O
bloodied O
bits O
of O
luggage O
and O
clothing B-TER
with O
injured B-TER
people B-TER
lying O
among O
them O
, O
looked O
like O
a O
battlefield O
. O

These O
thousands O
of O
people B-TER
were O
put O
up O
in O
five O
emergency B-TER
barracks B-TER
where O
they O
lay O
up O
to O
four O
deep O
without O
any O
organisation O
, O
without O
latrines B-TER
, O
without O
sanitary B-TER
facilities I-TER
and O
without O
straw O
mattresses O
or O
blankets O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
and O
their O
mistreatment O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
who O
chased O
them O
round O
with O
whips O
and O
pistols O
, O
there O
was O
such O
utter O
chaos O
during O
the O
first O
night O
that O
you O
could O
easily O
think O
you O
were O
looking O
at O
a O
mutiny O
. O

Many O
were O
picked O
out O
at O
random O
for O
special O
reprisals B-TER
and O
chained O
hand O
to O
hand O
in O
circles O
so O
that O
dogs O
could O
be O
set O
on O
them O
, O
and O
seventy O
went O
mad B-TER
that O
night O
. O

They O
were O
thrown O
into O
a O
wooden O
shed O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
moved O
in O
groups O
to O
the O
cells B-TER
where O
they O
were O
beaten O
personally O
by O
Oberscharführer B-TER
Sommer B-PER
. O

Because O
the O
twelve O
thousand O
newcomers O
included O
a O
relatively O
large O
number O
of O
well O
- O
off O
business B-TER
people B-TER
, O
the O
SS B-TER
used O
this O
opportunity O
not O
only O
to O
satisfy O
their O
lust O
for O
killing B-TER
but O
also O
as O
a O
means O
to O
personal O
enrichment B-TER
. O

This O
went O
on O
right O
down O
to O
the O
lowliest O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
and O
in O
an O
almost O
unimaginable O
way O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
over O
loudspeakers O
that O
people B-TER
who O
handed O
their O
cars O
or O
houses B-TER
over O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
leadership I-TER
would O
be O
released B-TER
first O
. O

Coins O
and O
notes O
were O
in O
constant O
circulation O
around O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
their O
criminal B-TER
accomplices O
. O

They O
must O
have O
extorted O
thousands O
of O
Marks B-TER
every O
day O
on O
pretexts O
such O
as O
disturbance O
, O
damage O
, O
or O
release O
expenses O
. O

When O
the O
campaign O
ended O
with O
a O
mass O
release B-TER
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
- O
after O
it O
had O
cost O
hundreds O
of O
dead B-TER
- O
millions O
worth O
had O
gone O
through O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Their O
corruption B-TER
and O
their O
close O
financial B-TER
connections O
with O
criminal B-TER
prisoners B-TER
undermined O
the O
position O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

That O
contributed O
substantially O
to O
Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
's I-PER
decision O
to O
bite O
the O
sour O
apple O
and O
fill O
the O
camp B-TER
overseer I-TER
roles O
with O
political B-TER
prisoners B-TER
in O
order O
to O
regain O
command O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
war B-TER
in O
September O
1939 O
the O
Kommandant B-TER
forbade O
further O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
for O
Jews O
, O
an O
order O
which O
was O
silently O
ignored O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
. O

The O
next O
mass O
campaign O
saw O
around O
2,500 O
Jews O
delivered O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
mostly O
stateless B-TER
men B-TER
from O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER
in O
the O
East O
. O

They O
were O
accommodated B-TER
behind O
barbed O
wire O
in O
five O
large O
tents B-TER
on O
the O
parade B-TER
ground I-TER
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
they O
were O
treated O
and O
fed B-TER
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
little O
camp O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
notorious O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Scharführers I-TER
Blank B-PER
and O
Hinkelmann B-PER
showed O
, O
as O
the O
SS B-TER
often O
said O
, O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
be O
liquidated B-TER
to O
the O
last O
man B-TER
. O

The O
group O
included O
the O
complete O
populations O
of O
various O
old O
people O
’s O
homes B-TER
and O
boarding O
schools B-TER
, O
and O
Camp B-TER
Leader I-TER
Hüttig B-PER
, O
shaking O
his O
head O
, O
said O
in O
my O
presence O
it O
’s O
unbelievable O
that O
they O
let O
this O
lot O
run O
around O
free O
up O
to O
now O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
they O
liquidated B-TER
them O
by O
the O
usual O
work B-TER
methods O
and O
by O
shooting B-TER
them O
while O
trying O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
moved O
onto O
keeping O
them O
confined O
within O
their O
barbed O
wire O
enclosure O
, O
giving O
them O
half O
of O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
, O
denying O
them O
underwear B-TER
, O
and O
leaving O
them O
standing O
so O
long O
on O
the O
parade O
ground O
in O
the O
winter O
weather O
that O
sixty O
of O
them O
were O
dying B-TER
every O
day O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
Scharführers B-TER
Blank B-PER
, O
Hinkelmann B-PER
and O
Sommer B-PER
got O
involved O
with O
particular O
enjoyment O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
several O
containers O
of O
poisoned O
food B-TER
were O
given O
out O
. O

From O
the O
start O
we O
fought O
a O
campaign O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
all O
this O
. O

Given O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
power O
relationships O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
we O
could O
only O
act O
against O
the O
SS B-TER
at O
one O
remove O
. O

But O
we O
had O
to O
act O
directly O
against O
their O
creatures O
among O
the O
prisoners B-TER
. O

We O
managed O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
foreman O
of O
the O
work B-TER
gang O
that O
took O
food B-TER
into O
the O
little O
camp B-TER
, O
putting O
our O
comrade O
Kurt B-PER
Posener I-PER
in O
his O
place O
, O
and O
he O
was O
able O
at O
the O
risk O
of O
his O
own O
life O
to O
smuggle B-TER
in O
extra O
food B-TER
for O
at O
least O
some O
of O
the O
comrades O
there O
. O

The O
two O
worst O
creatures O
, O
Wolf B-PER
and O
Rosenbaum B-PER
, O
stayed O
in O
their O
positions O
, O
but O
we O
managed O
to O
put O
in O
our O
Polish B-LOC
comrade O
Vulkan B-PER
as O
clerk O
, O
who O
through O
dedicated O
effort O
saved O
the O
lives O
of O
several O
further O
people B-TER
. O

Early O
in O
1940 O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
antifascist B-TER
Walter B-PER
Krämer I-PER
( O
murdered B-TER
in O
November O
1940 O
) O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
succeeded O
in O
working B-TER
on O
the O
doctor B-TER
so O
as O
to O
evacuate B-TER
the O
entire O
hellhole O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
it O
was O
spreading O
infection B-TER
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
and O
into O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
the O
surrounding O
villages O
. O

A O
little O
before O
that O
, O
comrades O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
had O
managed O
to O
set O
up O
an O
illegal O
ambulance O
service O
there O
. O

This O
rescue B-TER
action O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
five O
hundred O
barely O
living O
skeletons O
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
following O
things O
had O
happened O
since O
the O
start O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

On O
the O
9th O
of O
November O
1939 O
, O
the O
day O
after O
the O
provocation O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
beer O
hall O
assassination B-TER
attempt I-TER
, O
all O
the O
Jews O
were O
locked O
in O
their O
barracks B-TER
, O
in O
darkness O
. O

A O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
, O
among O
them O
Scharführers B-TER
Blank B-PER
and O
Jännisch B-PER
, O
picked O
out O
21 O
young O
, O
strong O
men B-TER
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
quarry O
, O
where O
they O
were O
shot B-TER
trying O
to O
escape O
. O

The O
rest O
spent O
three O
whole O
days O
shut O
up O
with O
nothing B-TER
to I-TER
eat I-TER
and O
wondering O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

Since O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
then O
had O
to O
go O
five O
days O
without B-TER
food I-TER
, O
allegedly O
because O
a O
pig O
had O
been O
stolen O
, O
these O
measures O
had O
especially O
grave O
results O
. O

The O
emptying O
of O
the O
little O
camp O
, O
described O
above O
, O
had O
not O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
plans O
for O
murdering B-TER
its O
inmates B-TER
. O

They O
were O
assigned O
to O
workgroups B-TER
breaking O
or O
carrying O
rocks O
in O
the O
quarry O
( O
whose O
leaders O
were O
again O
Blank B-PER
and O
Hinkelmann B-PER
) O
where O
the O
bloody O
task O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
alongside O
the O
usual O
torments B-TER
and O
shootings B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
this O
did O
largely O
happen O
. O

The O
successful O
elimination O
of O
various O
creatures O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
constant O
struggle O
led O
to O
the O
then O
block O

being O
denounced O
, O
replaced O

in O
the O

on O
3 O
May O
1940 O
. O

Alongside O

Ernst B-PER
Frommhold I-PER
, O
a O

elder I-TER
who O
was O
released B-TER

he O
had O
been O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
the O

against O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Fourteen O
days O
later O
Comrade O
Max B-PER
Vulkan I-PER
, O
mentioned O
above O
, O
was O
killed B-TER
in O
the O

I O
myself O
had O
been O
an O
unobserved O

to O

threatening B-TER
him O
If O
you O
ever O
say O
anything O
about O
what O
went O
on O
in O

I O
will O
make O

not O
succeed O

on O
the O

out O
who O
wrote O
it O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
difficult O
. O

In O
summer O
1940 O
Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
leader I-TER
Schobert B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
Florstadt B-PER
and O
several O
others O
from O
the O
command O
staff B-TER
visited O
the O
darning O
station O
that O
was O
being O
operated O
by O
sick B-TER
inmates B-TER
and O
sent O
all O
the O
Jews O
there O
to O
the O
quarry O
. O

Among O
those O
shot B-TER
on O
their O
first O
day O
at O
work B-TER
there O
was O
our O
Austrian B-LOC
comrade O
Hans B-PER
Kunke I-PER
. O

Alongside O
these O
special O
actions O
against O
Jewish O
groups O
or O
individuals O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
Jews O
were O
also O
obviously O
targeted O
for O
mass B-TER
death I-TER
through O
mistreatment B-TER
, O
hunger B-TER
, O
poisoning B-TER
by O
the O
camp B-TER
doctors B-TER
and O
so O
on O
. O

Given O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
and O
despite O
all O
resistance B-TER
of O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
groups O
, O
Jews O
were O
always O
the O
worst O
placed O
group O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
February O
1941 O
400 O
young O
Dutch B-LOC
Jews O
were O
brought O
to O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

Because O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
which O
we O
had O
fought O
for O
tooth O
and O
nail O
did O
not O
permit O
the O
mass B-TER
liquidation I-TER
which O
the O
SS B-TER
had O
planned O
they O
were O
transferred B-TER
to O
the O
camp B-TER
at O
Gusen B-LOC
near O
Mauthausen B-LOC
, O
where O
within O
eight O
days O
they O
were O
murdered B-TER
to O
the O
last O
man B-TER
. O

In O
the O
same O
year O
there O
was O
the O
first O
example O
of O
open O
resistance B-TER
to O
SS B-TER
murder B-TER
. O

Oberscharführer B-TER
Abraham B-PER
drowned B-TER
the O
Jewish O
prisoner B-TER
Hamber B-PER
in O
a O
puddle O
. O

His O
brother O
, O
formally O
questioned O
about O
the O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
as O
an O
eyewitness O
, O
told O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
entire O
work B-TER
group O
were O
then O
called O
to O
give O
evidence O
but O
understandably O
none O
of O
the O
others O
dared O
to O
say O
that O
they O
had O
seen O
anything O
. O

The O
foreman O
had O
to O
make O
a O
list O
of O
the O
names O
of O
his O
28 O
workers B-TER
. O

When O
he O
handed O
it O
over O
, O
Oberscharführer B-TER
Petrik B-PER
asked O
him O
Have O
you O
put O
your O
own O
name O
on O
the O
list O
? O
No O
! O
Then O
write O
your O
own O
name O
down O
as O
well O
! O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
were O
all O
sent O
back O
to O
their O
blocks O
. O

The O
murdered B-TER
man B-TER
’s I-TER
brother O
told O
me O
I O
know O
that O
I O
must O
die O
because O
of O
what O
I O
have O
said O
, O
but O
perhaps O
these O
criminals O
might O
hold O
back O
a O
little O
in O
future O
if O
they O
are O
afraid O
of O
being O
reported O
, O
and O
then O
I O
will O
not O
have O
died O
in O
vain O
. O

Around O
9 O
o’clock O
he O
was O
called O
to O
testify O
again O
and O
then O
to O
our O
astonishment O
came O
back O
to O
us O
half O
an O
hour O
later O
. O

Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
, O
the O
Adjutant B-TER
, O
the O
camp B-TER
leader B-TER
, O
the O
Rapportführer B-TER
etc O
. O

had O
questioned O
him O
. O

The O
Kommandant B-TER
had O
said O
We O
want O
the O
complete O
truth O
from O
you O
. O

I O
give O
you O
my O
word O
of O
honour O
that O
nothing O
will O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

He O
repeated O
what O
he O
had O
said O
before O
. O

Around O
11.30 O
he O
was O
called O
out O
of O
the O
block O
again O
, O
went O
to O
the O
cells B-TER
and O
was O
dead B-TER
four O
days O
later O
. O

It O
seems O
likely O
that O
at O
least O
until O
1942 O
no O
Jew O
left O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
alive O
, O
irrespective O
of O
why O
he O
might O
have O
gone O
there O
. O

The O
29 O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
listed O
as O
being O
in O
this O
work B-TER
group O
were O
all O
taken O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
one O
after O
another O
and O
each O
one O
died B-TER
on O
the O
fourth O
day O
. O

They O
tried O
in O
the O
stupidest O
way O
to O
cover O
up O
this O
multiple O
murder B-TER
which O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
knew O
about O
. O

One O
after O
another O
the O
next O
man O
on O
the O
list O
was O
transferred O
to O
another O
work B-TER
detail I-TER
a O
day O
or O
two O
beforehand O
, O
so O
as O
to O
disguise O
his O
membership O
of O
the O
group O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
with O
a O
broken B-TER
leg I-TER
, O
was O
carried O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
on O
a O
stretcher O
on O
Sommer B-PER
’s I-PER
orders O
and O
suffered O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
his O
colleagues O
. O

Another O
, O
a O
short O
shoemaker O
called O
Löwitus B-PER
, O
aged O
about O
40 O
, O
was O
released B-TER
before O
they O
got O
to O
him O
, O
because O
he O
could O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
SU O
as O
a O
citizen B-TER
of O
one O
of O
the O
Baltic O
States O
. O

The O
following O
examples O
will O
show O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
happened O
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
. O

Jochen B-PER
Pickard I-PER
, O
an O
antifascist B-TER
from O
the O
Rhineland B-LOC
, O
who O
was O
with O
me O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
and O
had O
after O
a O
while O
confessed O
to O
political B-TER
offences I-TER
in O
order O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
a O
penitentiary O
, O
was O
moved O
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
after O
he O
had O
finished O
his O
sentence O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
had O
not O
forgotten O
that O
he O
had O
for O
years O
denied O
all O
the O
allegations O
that O
had O
been O
thrown O
at O
him O
while O
he O
was O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
his O
arrival O
in O
Buchenwald B-TER
he O
went O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
, O
and O
did O
not O
leave O
it O
alive O
. O

Ernst B-PER
Heilmann I-PER
, O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
President O
of O
the O
Prussian O
Parliament O
, O
was O
put O
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
in O
1940 O
for O
no O
reason O
whatever O
and O
died B-TER
shortly O
afterwards O
. O

Kurt B-PER
Eisner I-PER
, O
the O
son O
of O
the O
Minister O
- O
President O
of O
Bavaria B-LOC
of O
the O
same O
name O
, O
who O
had O
already O
survived B-TER
several O
extraordinarily O
coldblooded O
attempts O
to O
murder B-TER
him O
, O
was O
questioned O
as O
a O
witness O
about O
some O
minor O
unpolitical O
nonsense O
involving O
another O
prisoner B-TER
. O

He O
told O
the O
Lagerführer B-TER
: O
I O
have O
been O
a O
prisoner B-TER
for O
ten O
years O
. O

You O
will O
not O
expect O
me O
to O
denounce B-TER
a O
comrade O
. O

He O
died B-TER
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1941 O
the O
notorious O
typhus B-TER
experiments B-TER
began O
. O

Ten O
Jews O
were O
chosen O
as O
the O
first O
victims B-TER
. O

There O
were O
fifty O
Jews O
in O
the O
next O
group O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
racial B-TER
superstitions I-TER
stopped O
them O
from O
using O
any O
more O
Jews O
, O
because O
their O
blood O
serum O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
injected O
into O
Aryans B-TER
. O

Early O
in O
1942 O
around O
400 O
Jews O
whom O
Dr O
Hoven B-PER
, O
the O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
, O
had O
declared O
unfit O
for O
work B-TER
were O
sent O
on O
so O
- O
called O
invalidtransports O
to O
a O
secret O
destination O
- O
this O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
experimental B-TER
poison O
gas B-TER
station O
. O

Over O
a O
year O
later O
the O
prisoner B-TER
records O
office O
was O
instructed O
to O
register O
these O
transports B-TER
as O
dead B-TER
. O

Hoven B-PER
told O
our O
comrade O
Weingärtner B-PER
( O
from O
Mannheim B-LOC
) O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
hospital I-TER
at O
that O
time O
If O
anything O
gets O
out O
about O
this O
, O
Weingärtner O
, O
we O
’ll O
both O
be O
hanged O
for O
it O
. O

He O
did O
not O
know O
that O
this O
apparent O
accomplice O
had O
in O
fact O
falsified O
the O
lists O
and O
rescued B-TER
a O
large O
number O
of O
comrades O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
our O
main O
task O
, O
in O
as O
far O
as O
we O
could O
not O
prevent O
these O
things O
from O
happening O
altogether O
, O
was O
to O
strengthen O
our O
cadres O
by O
protecting O
at O
least O
those O
comrades O
who O
were O
the O
most O
principled O
, O
cleanest O
, O
and O
most O
disposed O
to O
resistance B-TER
. O

An O
objective O
that O
was O
justified O
by O
success O
on O
11 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
transport B-TER
mentioned O
above O
took O
place O
over O
four O
days O
, O
on O
which O
three O
lorries O
drove O
up O
at O
morning O
parade O
and O
thirty O
men B-TER
whose O
names O
had O
been O
read O
out O
were O
loaded O
into O
each O
one O
. O

On O
the O
last O
day O
a O
lorry O
drove O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
where O
the O
sick B-TER
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
scheduled O
to O
go O
were O
thrown O
on O
wearing O
shirts B-TER
but O
no O
trousers B-TER
and O
driven O
off O
. O

On O
17 O
October O
1942 O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
from O
all O
camps B-TER
, O
penitentiaries B-TER
and O
jails B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
to O
the O
liquidation B-TER
camp I-TER
at O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

I O
stayed O
behind O
with O
200 O
comrades O
who O
were O
retained O
as O
skilled O
armaments O
workers B-TER
. O

Our O
position O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
now O
for O
the O
time O
being O
substantially O
improved O
. O

First O
, O
systematic O
struggle O
by O
the O
illegally O
organised O
antifascists B-TER
had O
caused O
the O
practically O
complete O
elimination O
of O
antisemitism B-TER
, O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
made O
immune O
to O
this O
plague O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
believed O
that O
they O
needed O
us O
as O
qualified O
workers B-TER
and O
therefore O
reined O
in O
their O
persecution B-TER
. O

In O
summer O
1943 O
we O
had O
another O
crisis O
. O

Scharführers B-TER
Schmidt B-PER
and O
Greuel B-PER
, O
Arbeitsführer B-TER
Simons B-PER
and O
Rapportführer B-TER
Hofschulte B-PER
along O
with O
Lagerführer B-TER
Gust B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
Hoven B-PER
and O
Wilhelm B-PER
, O
the O
SDG O
began O
a O
new O
liquidation O
campaign O
. O

The O
first O
two O
randomly O
reported O
a O
number O
of O
Jewish O
comrades O
for O
alleged O
idleness O
at O
work B-TER
. O

Simons B-PER
and O
Hofschulte B-PER
respectively O
authorised O
the O
floggings B-TER
and O
carried O
them O
out O
. O

Gust B-PER
transferred O
the O
victims B-TER
to O
the O
cellblock B-TER
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
the O
next O
day O
, O
where O
a O
poisoned B-TER
injection I-TER
by O
the O
management O
there O
saw O
to O
the O
rest O
. O

The O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
work O
of O
our O
comrades O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
succeeded O
in O
rescuing B-TER
some O
of O
the O
victims B-TER
and O
eventually O
stopping O
the O
campaign O
. O

Bribery B-TER
of O
the O
appropriate O
SS B-TER
criminals B-TER
played O
a O
role O
here O
, O
as O
so O
often O
. O

But O
15 O
comrades O
, O
among O
them O
the O
Czech B-LOC
antifascist B-TER
Max B-PER
Gallander I-PER
, O
died B-TER
. O

The O
pressure O
of O
this O
crisis O
for O
the O
first O
time O
raised O
the O
issue O
of O
forcible O
resistance B-TER
. O

Along O
with O
the O
responsible O
comrades O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
we O
were O
clear O
that O
any O
attempt O
at O
a O
general O
revolt B-TER
would O
have O
no O
prospect O
of O
success O
and O
thus O
could O
only O
have O
acted O
as O
a O
provocation O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
our O
efforts O
to O
stop O
this O
series O
of O
murders B-TER
in O
the O
ways O
usual O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
failed O
then O
we O
, O
as O
the O
responsible O
people B-TER
in O
the O
Jewish O
group O
, O
were O
determined O
to O
die B-TER
in O
a O
hopeless O
struggle O
rather O
than O
let O
ourselves O
be O
slaughtered O
one O
after O
the O
other O
like O
sheep O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
our O
previous O
work B-TER
then O
began O
to O
show O
themselves O
. O

The O
great O
majority O
of O
the O
Buchenwald B-LOC
Jews O
had O
trodden O
this O
path O
with O
us O
in O
contrast O
to O
all O
the O
millions O
who O
had O
allowed O
themselves O
to O
be O
murdered B-TER
without O
resistance B-TER
. O

The O
Warsaw B-LOC
Ghetto I-LOC
unfortunately O
still O
offers O
us O
the O
only O
exception O
to O
that O
. O

Constant O
withdrawal B-TER
of I-TER
rations I-TER
for O
the O
Jewish O
block O
, O
allegedly O
as O
a O
punishment O
, O
was O
taking O
place O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O
food B-TER
which O
was O
left O
over O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
was O
allocated O
to O
a O
number O
of O
other O
workgroups B-TER
. O

Solidarity O
among O
prisoners B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
showed O
itself O
in O
that O
these O
people B-TER
decided O
to O
hand O
this O
food B-TER
back O
to O
us O
even O
though O
they O
would O
have O
had O
to O
reckon O
with O
being O
punished O
if O
that O
became O
known O
. O

The O
Kammer O
, O
the O
Lagerschutz O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
brigade O
must O
be O
mentioned O
here O
above O
all O
, O
while O
other O
workgroups B-TER
whose O
members O
had O
not O
been O
so O
carefully O
vetted O
for O
antifascist B-TER
views O
could O
, O
through O
fear B-TER
of O
betrayal O
, O
only O
support O
us O
through O
individual O
actions O
by O
sympathetic O
comrades O
. O

The O
clerks O
’ O
office O
, O
work B-TER
statistics O
, O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
and O
controllers O
must O
be O
added O
to O
the O
first O
- O
named O
workgroups B-TER
. O

It O
is O
of O
course O
obvious O
from O
what O
is O
said O
above O
that O
all O
these O
actions O
had O
to O
be O
kept O
secret O
so O
that O
most O
Buchenwald B-TER
inmates B-TER
were O
unaware O
of O
them O
. O

1944 O
brought O
a O
change O
to O
the O
position O
through O
the O
mass O
transfer B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
East O
. O

First O
, O
following O
the O
complete O
subjection O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
transports B-TER
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
consisting O
of O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
men B-TER
at O
a O
time O
arrived O
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
where O
they O
had O
been O
selected B-TER
as O
capable O
of O
work B-TER
. O

Along O
with O
these O
, O
growing O
numbers O
of O
evacuation B-TER
transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
the O
Polish B-LOC
camps B-TER
as O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
advanced O
. O

There O
was O
in O
practical O
terms O
as O
little O
accommodation B-TER
available O
for O
them O
as O
for O
the O
thousands O
upon O
thousands O
of O
non O
- O
Jews O
who O
were O
dragged O
here O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
leader B-TER
took O
the O
view O
that O
so O
long O
as O
they O
could O
still O
close O
the O
door O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
not O
over O
- O
full O
. O

leadership B-TER
, O
above O
all O
Comrade O
Hans B-PER
Eidan I-PER
, O
succeeded O
by O
means O
of O
more O
or O
less O
open O
theft O
of O
SS B-TER
property O
in O
providing O
emergency B-TER
quarters O
, O
first O
in O
tents O
and O
later O
in O
emergency O
barracks B-TER
. O

These O
mass O
transports B-TER
were O
all O
put O
to O
work B-TER
outside O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
more O
or O
less O
condemned O
to O
waste O
slowly O
away O
in O
appalling O
conditions O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
develop O
any O
sense O
of O
unity O
and O
so O
had O
no O
leadership O
that O
could O
have O
stopped O
the O
worst O
happening O
. O

It O
is O
first O
of O
all O
the O
comrades O
in O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
office O
who O
must O
be O
thanked O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
extract O
not O
only O
the O
most O
actively O
helpful O
elements O
but O
also O
hundreds O
of O
children B-TER
and O
youths O
who O
would O
otherwise O
certainly O
have O
died B-TER
. O

And O
it O
is O
above O
all O
to O
the O
comrades O
from O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
sectors O
, O
who O
voluntarily O
took O
on O
fatigue O
duty O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
tent O
camp B-TER
, O
that O
we O
thank O
for O
the O
possibility O
in O
the O
short O
time O
we O
had O
at O
our O
disposal O
- O
sometimes O
a O
transport B-TER
of O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
was O
only O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
for O
three O
to O
four O
days O
- O
of O
sorting O
out O
the O
transports B-TER
so O
that O
we O
could O
free O
them O
from O
dangerous O
Nazi O
informants B-TER
and O
even O
sometimes O
set O
them O
up O
with O
their O
own O
leadership O
. O

A O
pleasant O
exception O
, O
which O
filled O
us O
with O
pride O
, O
was O
the O
evacuation B-TER
transport B-TER
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Monowitz I-LOC
. O

Here O
was O
a O
thorough O
, O
well O
- O
led O
, O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
prisoner B-TER
leadership O
. O

They O
were O
comrades O
from O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
been O
taken O
there O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
earlier O
. O

But O
one O
of O
our O
best O
people B-TER
, O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
Erich B-PER
Eisler I-PER
- O
along O
with O
Rudi B-PER
Arndt I-PER
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
leaders O
of O
our O
work B-TER
- O
had O
been O
murdered B-TER
in O
the O
cells B-TER
at O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

By O
the O
autumn O
of O
1944 O
the O
outside O
work B-TER
groups O
which O
had O
been O
made O
up O
from O
men B-TER
in O
these O
transports B-TER
had O
turned O
so O
many O
work B-TER
-fit O
men B-TER
into O
cripples B-TER
that O
the O
so O
- O
called O
sick B-TER
transports B-TER
began O
to O
come O
back O
here O
to O
take O
them O
off O
to O
liquidation B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

The O
Magdeburg B-LOC
and O
Zeist B-LOC
work B-TER
groups O
alone O
sent O
back O
1,500 O
candidates O
for O
death B-TER
. O

The O
efforts O
of O
our O
comrades O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
succeeded O
in O
removing O
around O
500 O
of O
them O
from O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
rather O
evident O
sabotage B-TER
by O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
and O
clerks O
’ O
offices O
yet O
others O
were O
kept O
here O
whom O
the O
SS B-TER
had O
listed O
to O
be O
taken O
away O
. O

But O
more O
than O
900 O
had O
to O
leave O
for O
Auschwitz B-TER
and O
death B-TER
, O
just O
before O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
’s O
activities O
there O
. O

Later O
on O
the O
work B-TER
leader O
demanded O
a O
list O
of O
children B-TER
in O
order O
to O
send O
them O
to O
the O
notorious O
camp B-TER
at O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

Once O
again O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
office O
managed O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
victims B-TER
to O
21 O
out O
of O
several O
hundred O
. O

The O
prisoner B-TER
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
helped O
here O
as O
well O
, O
just O
as O
it O
made O
a O
major O
contribution O
to O
everything O
that O
was O
achieved O
in O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

The O
continuously O
increasing O
overcrowding O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
meant O
that O
control O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
lacked O
the O
same O
intensity O
as O
before O
. O

The O
separation O
between O
Jews O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
increasingly O
broke O
down O
as O
1944 O
went O
by O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Jewish O
comrades O
accordingly O
began O
to O
operate O
more O
or O
less O
closely O
alongside O
their O
corresponding O
national B-TER
groups O
. O

The O
constant O
defeats O
for O
the O
Nazis O
and O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
Allied B-TER
liberation B-TER
forces B-TER
meant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
long O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
to O
mount O
a O
special O
action O
against O
the O
Jews O
. O

Then O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
4 O
April O
came O
the O
sudden O
order B-TER
All O
Jews O
to O
fall O
in O
on O
the O
parade O
ground O
immediately O
! O
. O

None O
of O
us O
doubted O
what O
that O
meant O
. O

A O
rapid O
, O
spur O
of O
the O
moment O
discussion O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
open O
mutiny B-TER
of O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
would O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
military B-TER
position O
, O
be O
pointless O
suicide B-TER
. O

However O
, O
obeying O
the O
order B-TER
- O
even O
though O
we O
would O
have O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
obey O
it O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
- O
would O
, O
equally O
, O
be O
cowardice O
. O

So O
we O
went O
in O
for O
open O
sabotage B-TER
: O
no O
- O
one O
went O
to O
the O
parade O
ground O
. O

On O
the O
urging O
of O
the O
active O
elements O
hundreds O
, O
if O
not O
thousands O
, O
fled O
to O
their O
non O
- O
Jewish O
comrades O
in O
different O
barracks B-TER
, O
the O
documentation O
in O
the O
blocks O
was O
burned O
, O
and O
the O
clerks O
’ O
office O
declared O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
put O
together O
a O
list O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
a O
short O
time O
. O

The O
Lagerschutz O
claimed O
that O
they O
could O
not O
find O
the O
Jews O
and O
in O
any O
case O
were O
not O
able O
to O
force O
eight O
thousand O
people B-TER
together O
with O
a O
team O
of O
only O
one O
hundred O
! O
The O
SS B-TER
hesitated O
and O
put O
the O
parade O
off O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

It O
all O
ended O
according O
to O
plan O
with O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
intentions O
as O
a O
result O
of O
open O
mutiny B-TER
among O
the O
active O
elements O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
the O
passive O
resistance B-TER
of O
the O
non O
- O
Jewish O
comrades O
. O

Around O
half O
, O
about O
3,000 O
, O
had O
fled B-TER
again O
and O
hidden B-TER
themselves O
among O
the O
others O
. O

These O
men B-TER
were O
of O
course O
the O
most O
active O
and O
determined O
to O
resist B-TER
. O

True O
to O
the O
order B-TER
that O
had O
been O
given O
out O
not O
to O
give O
up O
without O
a O
fight O
our O
comrade O
Kurt B-PER
Baum I-PER
from O
Herne B-LOC
, O
an O
antifascist B-TER
who O
had O
been O
locked O
up O
since O
1935 O
, O
attacked O
the O
Scharführer B-TER
who O
had O
run O
him O
down O
in O
his O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
with O
a O
spade O
and O
fell O
as O
the O
first O
victim B-TER
. O

But O
the O
block B-TER
leaders I-TER
were O
baffled O
and O
the O
search O
was O
not O
continued O
. O

3,000 O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
were O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
illegally O
. O

With O
that O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
totally O
lost O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
. O

The O
good O
effects O
of O
this O
development O
showed O
themselves O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

It O
had O
become O
significantly O
easier O
to O
hide B-TER
the O
46 O
comrades O
who O
were O
supposed O
to O
have O
been O
liquidated B-TER
, O
to O
whom O
I O
myself O
had O
been O
added O
to O
due O
to O
the O
sabotage B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish O
transport B-TER
. O

What O
happened O
in O
the O
next O
week O
does O
not O
belong O
here O
, O
as O
it O
concerns O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
a O
whole O
. O

This O
chapter O
ends O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
11 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
present O
report O
can O
obviously O
only O
set O
out O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
and O
is O
only O
intended O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
only O
goes O
into O
details O
where O
these O
are O
especially O
typical O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
significance O
of O
some O
specific O
events O
can O
only O
be O
understood O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
overall O
history O
of O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

This O
can O
not O
be O
dealt O
with O
here O
, O
although O
some O
of O
the O
content O
of O
the O
various O
reports O
will O
constantly O
recur O
. O

In O
all O
the O
events O
mentioned O
I O
was O
either O
present O
myself O
or O
learned O
of O
them O
directly O
from O
those O
involved O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
our O
work B-TER
and O
our O
struggle O
developed O
taught O
us O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
to O
operate O
using O
the O
rules O
of O
Jewish O
life O
which O
we O
know O
and O
obey O
in O
freedom O
. O

Our O
struggle O
for O
survival B-TER
against O
the O
SS B-TER
could O
not O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
an O
orthodox O
, O
liberal O
, O
Zionist B-TER
or O
socialist O
way O
. O

There O
was O
clearly O
only O
one O
option O
- O
unity O
among O
everyone O
who O
was O
willing O
to O
resist B-TER
, O
on O
the O
common O
basis O
of O
antifascism B-TER
. O

We O
rejected O
all O
those O
believers O
who O
preached O
that O
we O
should O
surrender O
to O
the O
Hitler B-PER
barbarism O
as O
a O
deserved O
punishment O
from O
God O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
piety O
among O
the O
Jews O
just O
as O
we O
rejected O
the O
cynicism O
of O
the O
informers B-TER
who O
would O
sell O
their O
brother O
for O
a O
slice O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
killed O
the O
Nazi O
bacillus O
within O
the O
barbed O
wire O
, O
even O
when O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
still O
in O
the O
watchtowers O
. O

Every O
Jew O
who O
, O
thinking O
and O
fighting O
, O
survived B-TER
Buchenwald B-LOC
will O
and O
must O
know O
his O
duty O

On O

May O
1945 O
we O
were O
theoretically O
liberated B-TER
by O
the O
Russian B-ORG
army B-TER
. O

The O
fortress B-LOC
i.e. O
Theresienstadt O
was O
immediately O
put O
under O
quarantine O
because O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
infected O
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
ignored O
the O
order O
not O
to O
leave O
the O
fortress B-LOC
and O
they O
and O
many O
others O
with O
them O
made O
trips O
to O
the O
area O
around O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
from O
where O
they O
returned O
with O
lots O
of O
cherries B-TER
. O

We O
had O
not O
seen O
any O
fruit B-TER
for O
ages O
and O
when O
some O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
brought O
cherries B-TER
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
without O
being O
stopped O
I O
too O
had O
the O
idea O
of O
picking O
cherries B-TER
in O
the O
gardens O
nearby O
. O

I O
was O
to O
pay O
dearly O
for O
this O
! O
On O
5 O
June O
1945 O
I O
followed O
the O
path O
leading O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
, O
along O
which O
were O
the O
orchards O
. O

On O
my O
way O
I O
came O
across O
a O
Soviet B-LOC
soldier B-TER
who O
thought O
I O
was O
a O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
who O
had O
put O
on O
civilian B-TER
clothes B-TER
in O
order O
to O
escape B-TER
imprisonment B-TER
. O

The O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
soldier B-TER
did O
not O
, O
or O
did O
not O
want O
to O
, O
understand O
German B-LOC
, O
and O
arrested B-TER
me O
. O

I O
laughed O
, O
because O
I O
was O
convinced O
I O
would O
be O
free B-TER
again O
within O
the O
hour O
, O
but O
I O
was O
terribly O
wrong O
. O

I O
was O
soon O
to O
stop O
laughing O
, O
for O
Ing O
[= O
Ingenieur O
] O
Vogel B-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
who O
has O
been O
appointed O
by O
the O
Soviets B-LOC
as O
mayor O
of O
the O
liberated B-TER
town O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
did O
nothing O
to O
get O
me O
released B-TER
, O
although O
as O
a O
Czech B-LOC
and O
a O
former O
member O
of O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
it O
was O
he O
who O
knew O
best O
what O
I O
had O
done O
for O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
helping O
me O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
take O
it O
out O
on O
the O
capitalist O
, O
who O
himself O
had O
become O
impoverished O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
accusations O
he O
brought O
against O
me O
, O
nor O
have O
I O
ever O
found O
out O
what O
his O
arguments O
were O
. O

However O
, O
I O
learnt O
after O
my O
liberation B-TER
that O
when O
questioning O
the O
former O
camp B-TER
commandant B-TER
, O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
, O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
Ing O
Vogel B-PER
asked O
him O
directly O
during O
the O
trial B-TER
whether O
I O
had O
violated O
Jewish O
interests O
. O

With O
the O
rope O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
stated O
clearly O
and O
definitely O
that O
I O
had O
always O
represented O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
had O
never O
acted O
against O
those O
interests O
. O

It O
would O
then O
damn O
well O
have O
been O
Vogel B-PER
’s I-PER
duty O
and O
obligation O
, O
in O
Prague B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
, O
to O
inform O
the O
authorities B-TER
of O
this O
statement O
by O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
. O

Only O
a O
small O
group O
know O
of O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
’s I-PER
answer O
. O

Vogel B-PER
has O
succeeded O
in O
withholding O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
’s I-PER
statement O
, O
which O
had O
been O
provoked O
by O
him O
and O
which O
was O
very O
favourable O
to O
me O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
I O
have O
had O
political B-TER
discussions O
with O
Vogel B-PER
which O
showed O
that O
I O
was O
his O
political B-TER
opponent O
, O
but O
I O
had O
always O
supported O
Vogel B-PER
as O
the O
head O
of O
a O
technical B-LOC
department I-LOC
. O

He O
even O
greeted O
me O
after O
the O
liberation B-TER
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Pancrace O
prison B-TER
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
not O
to O
be O
questioned O
as O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
told O
me O
, O
but O
to O
keep O
me O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

First O
, O
I O
had O
to O
strip O
to O
be O
searched O
for O
contraband B-TER
– O
exactly O
the O
same O
procedure O
as O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Except O
for O
the O
uniform B-TER
and O
the O
language O
, O
nothing O
had O
changed O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
cell B-TER
149 O
of O
section O
IIB O
. O

This O
cell B-TER
was O
already O
occupied O
by O
nine O
men B-TER
; O
when O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
there O
was O
such O
a O
nauseating O
stench O
that O
I O
could O
not O
help O
vomiting O
– O
the O
cell B-TER
in O
question O
was O
in O
fact O
designed O
for O
a O
single O
prisoner B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
floor O
like O
sardines O
; O
when O
one O
of O
us O
wanted O
to O
turn O
over O
– O
you O
could O
not O
lie O
on O
the O
same O
side O
all O
the O
time O
after O
all O
– O
he O
had O
to O
signal O
so O
that O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
could O
turn O
over O
. O

My O
cell B-TER
companions O
had O
been O
imprisoned B-TER
since O
early O
May O
, O
and O
despite O
the O
short O
time O
there O
were O
completely O
starving B-TER
. O

I O
had O
some O
bread B-TER
with O
me O
, O
which O
they O
at O
once O
greedily O
devoured O
. O

The O
next O
day O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
office O
. O

There O
I O
had O
to O
provide O
my O
signature O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
I O
signed O
, O
since O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
any O
Czech B-LOC
at O
all O
. O

I O
had O
some O
Russian B-LOC
silver O
coins B-TER
with O
me O
which O
I O
had O
kept O
as O
a O
souvenir O
from O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
and O
also O
450 O
Czech B-LOC
crowns B-TER
. O

All O
this O
was O
confiscated B-TER
, O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
it O
again O
. O

This O
procedure O
being O
completed O
, O
I O
was O
led O
back O
, O
not O
to O
the O
same O
cell B-TER
, O
however O
, O
but O
to O
the O
door O
of O
cell B-TER
197 O
, O
section O
IIIB O
. O

The O
Roman O
numerals O
indicate O
the O
floor O
where O
the O
cell B-TER
is O
. O

Thus O
IIIB O
was O
on O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

Although O
I O
had O
not O
left O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
I O
had O
to O
strip O
to O
be O
searched O
again O
. O

Only O
then O
was O
I O
allowed O
to O
enter O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
, O
I O
had O
to O
stand O
there O
with O
my O
face O
turned O
to O
the O
wall O
– O
just O
like O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

In O
cell B-TER
197 O
there O
were O
only O
seven O
prisoners B-TER
, O
six O
Czechs B-LOC
and O
one O
German B-LOC
from O
the O
Sudetenland B-LOC
. O

Although O
I O
spent O
only O
one O
night O
with O
these O
Czechs B-LOC
I O
got O
a O
very O
good O
impression O
of O
them O
. O

Later O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
my O
first O
impression O
was O
correct O
. O

One O
of O
them O
escaped B-TER
later O
. O

He O
had O
been O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
youth B-TER
organisation I-TER
. O

That O
was O
one O
reason O
why O
he O
was O
mistreated B-TER
in O
an O
especially O
cruel O
way O
. O

They O
put O
a O
water O
hose O
into O
his O
mouth O
, O
turned O
the O
water O
on O
, O
and O
allowed O
the O
full O
water O
pressure O
into O
his O
body O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
, O
the O
torture B-TER
this O
man B-TER
had O
to O
suffer O
. O

I O
just O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
Czech B-LOC
people B-TER
could O
carry O
out O
such O
brutal O
actions O
. O

They O
had O
learnt O
well O
, O
too O
well O
, O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

I O
saw O
atrocities O
like O
those O
I O
have O
experienced O
only O
at O
the O
worst O
times O
. O

On O
Monday O
16 O
July O
1945 O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
were O
separated O
from O
the O
Germans B-LOC
because O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
were O
given O
more O
and O
better O
food B-TER
. O

As O
I O
did O
n’t O
understand O
any O
Czech B-LOC
and O
only O
spoke O
German B-LOC
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
I O
who O
had O
been O
persecuted B-TER
for O
many O
years O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
was O
now O
lumped O
in O
with O
my O
enemies O
. O

The O
small O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
was O
particularly O
hard O
for O
me O
because O
I O
had O
been O
underfed O
for O
years O
and O
had O
hardly O
recovered O
. O

The O
food B-TER
was O
totally O
insufficient O
. O

Dinner B-TER
consisted O
of O
0.2 O
litres O
of O
soup B-TER
, O
sometimes O
with O
a O
small O
potato B-TER
in O
it O
. O

If O
there O
was O
gravy B-TER
and O
potatoes B-TER
you O
might O
perhaps O
be O
lucky O
enough O
to O
get O
one O
and O
half O
potatoes B-TER
and O
0.1 O
litre O
of O
gravy B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
we O
got O
145 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
an O
additional O
72.5 O
g O
in O
the O
evening O
three O
times O
a O
week O
. O

Many O
ate O
their O
bread B-TER
immediately O
, O
others O
watched O
it O
carefully O
in O
order O
to O
ration B-TER
it O
; O
I O
belonged O
to O
the O
latter O
group O
, O
because O
of O
my O
own O
experience O
. O

But O
whatever O
you O
did O
, O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
and O
you O
did O
not O
get O
any O
more O
. O

People B-TER
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
, O
precipitated O
by O
frequent O
bouts O
of O
diarrhoea B-TER
which O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
. O

I O
had O
starved B-TER
in O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
but O
had O
not O
felt O
the O
hunger B-TER
so O
much O
there O
as O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
additional O
mental B-TER
suffering O
. O

We O
were O
so O
dreadfully O
hungry B-TER
that O
we O
tore O
grass O
from O
the O
meagre O
lawn O
during O
our O
turns O
in O
the O
courtyard O
in O
order O
to O
eat B-TER
it O
. O

Anyone O
caught O
red O
- O
handed O
was O
flogged O
. O

That O
is O
why O
there O
was O
a O
big O
but O
: O
how O
could O
we O
get O
this O
grass O
without O
being O
noticed O
by O
the O
overseer O
? O
That O
was O
not O
easy O
because O
the O
guards B-TER
watched O
us O
very O
closely O
. O

One O
of O
our O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
would O
stop O
and O
bend O
down O
in O
order O
to O
re O
- O
tie O
loose O
shoe B-TER
laces O
. O

Thus O
he O
drew O
the O
guard B-TER
’s I-TER
attention O
to O
himself O
and O
one O
of O
the O
others O
could O
pull O
up O
some O
grass O
which O
was O
shared O
out O
and O
eaten B-TER
in O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
one O
of O
the O
head O
warders B-TER
lived O
on O
eggs B-TER
– O
allegedly O
for O
health B-TER
reasons O
. O

Convinced O
, O
though O
wrongly O
, O
that O
by O
eating O
egg B-TER
shells O
we O
would O
provide O
our O
bodies O
with O
calcium O
, O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
give O
us O
the O
shells O
, O
which O
he O
did O
very O
readily O
. O

We O
then O
ground O
the O
shells O
to O
powder O
and O
ate B-TER
them O
, O
until O
a O
doctor B-TER
was O
transferred O
to O
our O
cell B-TER
. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
the O
egg B-TER
shell O
had O
no O
nutritional B-TER
value O
at O
all O
, O
and O
left O
the O
body O
unchanged O
. O

We O
had O
lost O
an O
illusion O
! O
To O
fill O
our O
stomachs O
more O
effectively O
we O
soaked O
the O
bread B-TER
in O
water B-TER
until O
it O
was O
like O
mush B-TER
. O

Thus O
the O
volume O
of O
our O
food B-TER
was O
greater O
and O
we O
felt O
full O
, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
not O
more O
nutritious B-TER
. O

We O
only O
had O
one O
thought O
: O
what O
can O
we O
do O
about O
the O
hunger B-TER
? O
Some O
smoked O
the O
potato B-TER
peelings O
to O
try O
to O
think O
of O
something O
else O
. O

Although O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
were O
my O
enemies O
, O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
watch O
them O
being O
even O
more O
maltreated O
… O
and O
they O
really O
were O
dreadfully O
maltreated O
! O
In O
our O
cell B-TER
there O
was O
a O
Gestapoman O
who O
was O
targeted O
from O
time O
to O
time O
by O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

It O
was O
particularly O
horrible O
because O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
watch O
. O

Usually O
these O
atrocities O
took O
place O
on O
Sundays O
, O
because O
there O
was O
less O
supervision O
. O

On O
the O
floor O
below O
us O
there O
were O
Hitler B-ORG
youth I-ORG
, O
they O
were O
called O
Werewolves O
, O
a O
name O
I O
had O
not O
come O
across O
before O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
hear O
them O
howling O
with O
pain O
. O

One O
day O
a O
cell B-TER
mate O
called O
Gallee B-PER
was O
fetched O
for O
an O
interrogation O
. O

When O
he O
came O
back O
we O
hardly O
recognised O
him O
. O

His O
face O
was O
puffy B-TER
, O
his O
hands O
extremely O
swollen B-TER
, O
he O
was O
carrying O
his O
shoes B-TER
because O
they O
no O
longer O
fitted O
. O

The O
interrogator B-TER
wanted O
to O
make O
him O
confess O
that O
he O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
which O
Gallee B-PER
kept O
insisting O
he O
was O
not O
, O
despite O
the O
torture B-TER
. O

For O
quite O
some O
time O
Gallee B-PER
was O
unable O
to O
walk O
or O
eat B-TER
. O

As O
we O
learnt O
later O
, O
he O
had O
been O
mistaken O
for O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
of O
a O
similar O
name O
. O

On O
25 O
July O
1945 O
there O
was O
a O
sudden O
and O
unexpected O
order B-TER
: O
To O
work O
! O
The O
guard B-TER
selected B-TER
those O
men B-TER
who O
were O
strong O
enough O
to O
work B-TER
; O
Gallee B-PER
and O
I O
were O
not O
amongst O
them O
. O

When O
the O
workers B-TER
returned O
from O
work B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
they O
were O
thrilled O
, O
because O
they O
had O
been O
received O
so O
well O
by O
the O
population B-TER
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
people B-TER
had O
not O
known O
that O
these O
were O
Germans B-LOC
. O

From O
all O
sides O
they O
had O
been O
slipped O
bread B-TER
and O
an O
occasional O
piece O
of O
sausage B-TER
. O

The O
bread B-TER
which O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
eat B-TER
they O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
gave O
into O
temptation O
to O
eat B-TER
my O
fill O
, O
which O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
me O
– O
it O
turned O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
following O
evening O
the O
workers B-TER
had O
to O
line O
up O
outside O
the O
cell B-TER
door O
. O

All O
the O
bread B-TER
they O
had O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

The O
work B-TER
they O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
clear O
the O
narrow O
courtyards O
of O
the O
rubbish O
that O
had O
accumulated O
over O
the O
years O
. O

As O
I O
saw O
later O
, O
the O
rubbish O
was O
metres O
high O
in O
the O
narrow O
Prague B-LOC
courtyards O
, O
giving O
rise O
to O
air O
pollution O
. O

Since O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
painted O
a O
glowing O
picture O
of O
their O
work B-TER
I O
was O
also O
tempted O
to O
apply O
for O
work B-TER
, O
to O
make O
life O
more O
tolerable O
. O

My O
guard B-TER
wanted O
to O
help O
me O
, O
and O
put O
me O
into O
a O
group O
which O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

He O
thought O
we O
would O
be O
well O
fed B-TER
there O
; O
but O
although O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
very O
hard O
, O
we O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
at O
all O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
Russian B-LOC
soldier B-TER
wanted O
to O
fetch O
us O
again O
, O
but O
nobody O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

The O
Russian B-LOC
promised O
us O
a O
hot O
meal B-TER
and O
plenty O
of O
bread B-TER
… O
and O
compensation B-TER
for O
the O
previous O
day O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
even O
harder O
, O
we O
were O
harried O
like O
slaves O
. O

We O
were O
given O
not O
food B-TER
but O
whippings O
. O

Some O
days O
later O
I O
went O
into O
the O
town O
with O
a O
work B-TER
detail O
. O

We O
were O
employed O
to O
sweep O
the O
streets O
and O
also O
to O
clear O
the O
heaps O
of O
rubble O
. O

These O
were O
so O
firmly O
compacted O
that O
we O
had O
to O
use O
hoes O
to O
loosen O
them O
. O

To O
make O
up O
for O
this O
we O
received O
250 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
50 O
g O
of O
sausage B-TER
. O

After O
starving B-TER
for O
so O
long O
this O
was O
a O
real O
relief O
. O

But O
we O
only O
got O
this O
ration B-TER
once O
, O
it O
became O
smaller O
every O
day O
– O
whether O
this O
was O
above O
board O
or O
through O
racketeering O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

My O
body O
, O
however O
, O
was O
telling O
me O
that O
I O
was O
using O
up O
more O
calories O
than O
I O
was O
consuming O
, O
so O
that O
I O
had O
to O
give O
up O
working B-TER
: O
after O
all O
, O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
completely O
to O
the O
dogs O
. O

What O
made O
the O
work B-TER
worse O
was O
that O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
workmen B-TER
themselves O
who O
beat O
us O
with O
their O
rifle O
butts O
. O

Even O
though O
they O
were O
road O
sweepers O
themselves O
they O
did O
not O
have O
a O
clue O
how O
to O
work B-TER
efficiently O
. O

They O
forced O
us O
eight O
at O
a O
time O
to O
load O
a O
lorry O
from O
one O
side O
. O

Consequently O
we O
stood O
in O
each O
other O
’s O
way O
, O
and O
could O
not O
help O
throwing O
the O
dirt O
at O
each O
other O
. O

If O
they O
had O
employed O
four O
men B-TER
at O
a O
time O
, O
letting O
us O
work B-TER
in O
turns O
, O
we O
could O
easily O
have O
done O
much O
more O
. O

But O
this O
would O
have O
required O
brains O
, O
which O
they O
did O
not O
have O
. O

After O
a O
longer O
interval O
some O
workers B-TER
were O
withdrawn O
from O
a O
work B-TER
detail O
, O
the O
best O
one O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
were O
put O
into O
a O
transport B-TER
. O

A O
cell B-TER
mate O
who O
worked B-TER
in O
this O
group O
took O
me O
with O
him O
and O
now O
a O
golden O
period O
began O
for O
me O
, O
which O
was O
to O
last O
from O
10 O
October O
until O
just O
before O
Christmas B-TER
. O

There O
was O
plenty O
of O
very O
good O
food B-TER
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
some O
food B-TER
back O
to O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
who O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

This O
was O
to O
be O
my O
undoing O
later O
. O

In O
July O
and O
also O
in O
August O
somebody O
had O
delivered O
a O
parcel O
with O
linen O
and O
food B-TER
for O
me O
. O

The O
food B-TER
was O
withheld O
from O
me O
, O
a O
KZ B-TER
Konzentrationslager O
– O
concentration O
camp O
prisoner B-TER
! O
– O
it O
was O
confiscated B-TER
because O
at O
that O
time O
Germans B-LOC
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
receive O
food B-TER
. O

Finally O
I O
received O
one O
parcel O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
guard B-TER
; O
the O
trusty O
had O
stolen O
only O
the O
butter B-TER
. O

In O
this O
parcel O
there O
were O
two O
pieces O
of O
soap B-TER
and O
125 O
g O
of O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
. O

As O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
almost O
daily O
and O
the O
bread B-TER
we O
had O
saved O
was O
confiscated B-TER
each O
time O
, O
I O
preferred O
to O
take O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
and O
soap B-TER
with O
me O
when O
I O
went O
to O
work B-TER
. O

The O
reader O
will O
be O
surprised O
and O
ask O
, O
So O
, O
there O
was O
some O
saved O
bread O
was O
there O
? O
On O
Saturdays O
we O
only O
worked B-TER
until O
noon O
, O
and O
often O
not O
at O
all O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
we O
saved O
some O
bread B-TER
, O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
make O
do O
with O
the O
scarce O
food B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
on O
Saturdays O
and O
Sundays O
. O

On O
10 O
December O
1945 O
I O
met O
my O
misfortune O
in O
the O
person O
of O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
Waliczek B-PER
. O

I O
had O
brought O
my O
billycan O
full O
of O
food B-TER
for O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
. O

This O
was O
immediately O
confiscated B-TER
for O
Waliczek B-PER
’s I-PER
watchdogs O
, O
followed O
by O
my O
towel O
, O
soap B-TER
and O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
. O

He O
argued O
that O
I O
had O
stolen O
these O
things O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
that O
he O
did O
not O
become O
violent O
, O
particularly O
as O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O

Usually O
he O
beat O
people B-TER
up O
mercilessly O
. O

When O
I O
wanted O
to O
complain O
about O
him O
the O
guard B-TER
said O
, O
Do O
n’t O
do O
it O
, O
you O
’ll O
be O
left O
to O
carry O
the O
can O
! O
I O
had O
saved O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
because O
I O
knew O
that O
we O
would O
not O
be O
working B-TER
from O
before O
Christmas B-TER
until O
4 O
January O
because O
of O
lack O
of O
coal O
, O
and O
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
have O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
during O
that O
time O
. O

But O
I O
had O
not O
reckoned O
with O
warder B-TER
Waliczek B-PER
, O
whom O
the O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
guards B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
during O
the O
German B-LOC
times O
described O
as O
someone O
who O
had O
always O
boasted O
that O
he O
was O
German B-LOC
. O

They O
thought O
that O
now O
he O
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
he O
was O
a O
good O
Czech B-LOC
. O

One O
evening O
when O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
already O
locked O
for O
the O
night O
our O
cell B-TER
door O
suddenly O
opened O
. O

Waliczek B-PER
appeared O
with O
several O
officials O
; O
he O
said O
to O
Knurrhahn B-PER
, O
a O
prisoner B-TER
and O
former O
guard B-TER
, O
Please O
come O
outside O
! O
No O
sooner O
had O
the O
door O
closed O
again O
than O
we O
heard O
a O
heavy O
fall O
, O
followed O
by O
loud O
groans O
. O

Knurrhahn B-PER
had O
been O
thrown O
to O
the O
floor O
by O
all O
the O
officials O
, O
then O
picked O
up O
, O
thrown O
down O
, O
and O
finally O
flung O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
a O
new O
prisoner B-TER
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
, O
who O
was O
bleeding B-TER
like O
a O
stuck O
pig O
. O

His O
name O
was O
Walter B-PER
, O
he O
had O
become O
a O
German B-LOC
and O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
did O
not O
forgive O
him O
for O
that O
Translator O
’s O
note O
: O
this O
was O
of O
course O
during O
the O
German O
occupation O
of O
the O
Czechoslovakian O
Republic O
. O

I O
often O
thought O
I O
was O
in O
a O
madhouse O
. O

I O
could O
continue O
talking O
for O
a O
long O
time O
about O
these O
incidents O
; O
but O
I O
think O
that O
will O
do O
to O
give O
the O
reader O
an O
idea O
of O
what O
human O
irrationality O
can O
lead O
to O
. O

Instead O
of O
turning O
away O
from O
the O
atrocities O
committed O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
these O
were O
used O
as O
pretexts O
and O
excuses O
to O
commit O
new O
crimes O
, O
even O
murders B-TER
, O
in O
prisons B-TER
. O

I O
am O
convinced O
that O
none O
of O
these O
atrocities O
could O
have O
happened O
if O
there O
had O
been O
strict O
supervision O
. O

The O
director O
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
the O
head O
warders B-TER
were O
either O
too O
lazy O
or O
too O
cowardly O
or O
they O
even O
took O
part O
in O
these O
crimes O
. O

They O
let O
the O
younger O
guards B-TER
do O
as O
they O
wished O
. O

From O
4 O
January O
1946 O
until O
6 O
February O
I O
was O
again O
with O
my O
work B-TER
detail O
. O

I O
was O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
or O
see O
anything O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
receiving O
good O
food B-TER
again O
. O

Unfortunately O
these O
good O
times O
were O
to O
end O
on O
6 O
February O
. O

On O
that O
day O
a O
five O
- O
ton O
lorry O
came O
especially O
to O
take O
me O
from O
my O
work B-TER
back O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
. O

In O
the O
police B-TER
guardroom O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
I O
was O
informed O
that O
my O
sons O
were O
fine O
… O
and O
then O
I O
was O
forbidden O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
the O
official O
was O
afraid O
I O
might O
escape B-TER
. O

If O
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
do O
that O
I O
could O
have O
fled B-TER
any O
day O
, O
as O
many O
others O
did O
. O

I O
was O
not O
interested O
in O
escaping B-TER
because O
that O
would O
have O
proved O
that O
I O
had O
a O
guilty O
conscience O
. O

But O
if O
I O
had O
known O
what O
lay O
ahead O
of O
me O
, O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
spend O
another O
whole O
year O
in O
Czech B-LOC
prisons B-TER
and O
that O
I O
would O
almost O
die B-TER
, O
I O
would O
have O
fled B-TER
then O
. O

On O
15 O
February O
I O
was O
suddenly O
fetched O
and O
handed O
over O
to O
a O
superintendent O
of O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters O
. O

He O
took O
me O
to O
his O
office O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
first O
and O
only O
examination O
. O

When O
it O
was O
over O
the O
official O
explained O
to O
me O
, O
On O
Monday O
or O
Tuesday O
we O
are O
having O
a O
conference O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
present O
your O
personal O
case O
and O
you O
will O
be O
released O
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

You O
can O
count O
on O
compensation O
for O
wrongful O
imprisonment O
. O

Then O
he O
led O
me O
to O
the O
officers O
’ O
mess O
, O
ordered O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
food B-TER
for O
me O
, O
and O
left O
after O
shaking O
my O
hand O
. O

Then O
I O
really O
believed O
that O
I O
would O
be O
released B-TER
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

But O
I O
was O
to O
stay O
another O
eleven O
long O
, O
hard O
months O
, O
virtually O
put O
into O
cold O
storage O
. O

I O
had O
expected O
the O
affairs O
of O
a O
former O
KZ B-TER
prisoner B-TER
to O
be O
given O
priority O
treatment O
, O
but O
I O
was O
mistaken O
; O
there O
was O
no O
conference O
at O
all O
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
had O
overdone O
it O
by O
arresting B-TER
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
indiscriminately O
. O

They O
were O
simply O
not O
able O
to O
cope O
with O
these O
cases O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
I O
had O
been O
put O
back O
into O
section O
BIII O
and O
so O
I O
was O
starving B-TER
again O
. O

So O
I O
tried O
to O
obtain O
the O
Czech B-LOC
rations B-TER
I O
was O
entitled O
to O
. O

I O
asked O
to O
see O
the O
director O
, O
but O
the O
guard B-TER
took O
me O
to O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
instead O
. O

This O
man B-TER
listened O
to O
me O
… O
nothing O
happened O
! O
Section O
IIIB O
was O
run O
particularly O
badly O
, O
the O
guard B-TER
was O
the O
mere O
tool O
of O
the O
trusty O
, O
he O
did O
not O
care O
about O
anything O
. O

We O
even O
had O
to O
collect O
drinking O
water B-TER
from O
the O
toilet O
; O
I O
can O
well O
imagine O
that O
this O
was O
why O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

In O
April O
1946 O
I O
saw O
the O
director O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
his O
rounds O
. O

I O
presented O
my O
request O
to O
him O
, O
he O
promised O
to O
examine O
my O
case O
, O
but O
nothing O
happened O
! O
When O
at O
last O
I O
had O
had O
enough O
I O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
. O

This O
was O
not O
allowed O
but O
had O
the O
effect O
nevertheless O
that O
my O
situation O
was O
considered O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
transferred O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
because O
the O
people B-TER
in O
Prague B-LOC
did O
not O
dare O
to O
decide O
anything O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
continued O
to O
starve B-TER
until O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
felt O
sorry O
for O
me O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
parcel O
. O

This O
was O
not O
allowed O
either O
, O
but O
for O
a O
week O
I O
had O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

On O
26 O
June O
1946 O
I O
was O
transferred B-TER
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

Leitmeritz B-LOC
was O
better O
organised O
than O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Immediately O
and O
urgently O
I O
demanded O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
which O
the O
guard B-TER
simply O
denied O
me O
, O
since O
I O
had O
not O
spoken O
to O
him O
in O
Czech B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
demanded O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
, O
he O
refused O
this O
too O
. O

The O
following O
week O
, O
however O
, O
I O
requested O
permission O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
director O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
write O
to O
the O
English B-LOC
ambassador B-TER
, O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
and O
to O
my O
son O
, O
he O
at O
once O
granted O
permission O
. O

Getting O
bolder O
, O
I O
asked O
for O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
which O
I O
received O
the O
same O
day O
. O

Now O
at O
last O
I O
had O
contact O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
although O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
until O
I O
received O
an O
answer O
. O

On O
the O
day O
after O
my O
committal O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
I O
was O
presented O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
doctor B-TER
who O
realised O
how O
weakened O
I O
was O
, O
and O
promised O
at O
once O
that O
I O
would O
be O
put O
into O
the O
prison B-TER
hospital B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
there O
was O
a O
bed O
available O
. O

But O
before O
my O
admission O
I O
had O
a O
serious O
bout O
of O
enteritis B-TER
. O

At O
last O
, O
on O
9 O
August O
, O
I O
was O
admitted O
and O
stayed O
in O
this O
ward O
until O
my O
release B-TER
on O
9 O
January O
1947 O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
came O
across O
guards B-TER
who O
had O
stayed O
humane O
. O

Prohaska B-PER
and O
Faltin B-PER
, O
two O
young O
guards B-TER
who O
had O
suffered O
themselves O
under O
the O
Germans B-LOC
and O
therefore O
knew O
how O
a O
prisoner B-TER
felt O
. O

But O
there O
were O
also O
others O
: O
the O
worst O
ones O
were O
probably O
Adamczyk B-PER
and O
Pfeifer B-PER
. O

The O
latter O
treated O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
called O
Seifert B-PER
on O
his O
arrival O
by O
forcing O
him O
to O
lie O
in O
a O
bath O
filled O
with O
cold O
water O
. O

He O
was O
made O
to O
put O
his O
feet O
out O
, O
and O
Pfeifer B-PER
tortured B-TER
them O
so O
badly O
that O
Seifert B-PER
passed O
out O
. O

Seifert B-PER
never O
recovered O
from O
this O
maltreatment B-TER
, O
and O
died B-TER
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
1946 O
. O

Although O
as O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
he O
was O
entitled O
to O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
he O
did O
not O
get O
it O
, O
nor O
was O
he O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
as O
he O
had O
requested O
. O

Adamczyk B-PER
shattered O
a O
boy O
’s O
eardrum B-TER
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
not O
knowing O
the O
Czech B-LOC
language O
was O
the O
worst O
that O
could O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
were O
able O
to O
gain O
many O
an O
advantage O
thanks O
to O
their O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
language O
. O

Even O
worse O
then O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
the O
trusties O
, O
though O
they O
were O
prisoners B-TER
themselves O
. O

They O
were O
chosen O
by O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

The O
trusties O
distributed O
the O
food B-TER
and O
whoever O
could O
pay O
with O
a O
cigarette O
got O
more O
food B-TER
and O
more O
bread B-TER
, O
naturally O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
offer O
. O

That O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
bad O
psychologists O
is O
surely O
proved O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
of O
the O
trusties O
was O
hanged O
and O
another O
one O
was O
sentenced O
to O
ten O
years O
’ O
hard O
labour B-TER
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
trusties O
beat O
their O
fellow O
prisoners B-TER
in O
order O
to O
gain O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
- O
Pancrace B-LOC
I O
was O
in O
four O
different O
sections O
. O

Only O
one O
, O
section O
A11 O
, O
was O
properly O
organised O
, O
although O
this O
was O
the O
German B-LOC
section O
. O

Every O
day O
we O
received O
a O
jug O
of O
drinking O
water B-TER
, O
a O
bucket O
of O
water O
for O
washing O
, O
and O
more O
drinking O
water B-TER
several O
times O
on O
hot O
days O
. O

Each O
cell B-TER
had O
a O
jug O
and O
a O
bucket O
, O
something O
no O
other O
section O
had O
to O
offer O
. O

There O
were O
also O
enough O
blankets O
and O
palliasses O
[ O
straw O
mattresses O
] O
in O
section O
AII O
and O
they O
were O
well O
kept O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
Prohaska B-PER
saw O
to O
it O
that O
the O
palliasses O
were O
refilled O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
that O
the O
dust O
was O
beaten O
out O
of O
the O
blankets O
. O

In O
section O
A1 O
the O
palliasses O
were O
in O
a O
bad O
state O
and O
there O
were O
not O
enough O
of O
them O
: O
seven O
men B-TER
had O
to O
share O
three O
. O

Section O
BIII O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
. O

There O
had O
been O
only O
two O
palliasses O
for O
seven O
men B-TER
until O
we O
gave O
some O
cigarettes O
[ O
in O
exchange O
] O
for O
two O
extra O
palliasses O
, O
and O
even O
for O
blankets O
! O
Although O
when O
we O
had O
asked O
before O
for O
blankets O
and O
palliasses O
the O
guard B-TER
had O
told O
us O
he O
had O
not O
got O
any O
. O

Cigarettes O
were O
the O
keys O
to O
every O
door O
! O
From O
about O
April O
1946 O
smoking O
was O
officially O
permitted O
in O
Pancrace B-LOC
but O
only O
for O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

But O
this O
ban O
for O
Germans B-LOC
was O
not O
observed O
too O
strictly O
since O
it O
meant O
a O
good O
income O
. O

The O
daily O
ration O
was O
two O
cigarettes O
but O
the O
cigarettes O
which O
arrived O
in O
the O
parcels O
– O
and O
there O
were O
fifty O
in O
each O
parcel O
– O
usually O
were O
not O
sufficient O
until O
the O
next O
delivery O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
fellow O
smokers O
. O

Many O
workers B-TER
brought O
cigarettes O
from O
outside O
into O
their O
cells B-TER
. O

That O
was O
forbidden O
, O
and O
there O
were O
daily O
body O
searches O
, O
but O
they O
still O
succeeded O
. O

Often O
the O
cigarettes O
were O
confiscated O
but O
just O
as O
often O
the O
workers B-TER
succeeded O
in O
tricking O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
daily O
struggle O
between O
guard B-TER
and O
prisoner B-TER
. O

First O
the O
guard B-TER
won O
, O
then O
the O
prisoner B-TER
. O

Often O
good O
- O
natured O
guards B-TER
let O
the O
cigarettes O
through O
. O

Once O
even O
a O
razor O
was O
smuggled B-TER
into O
the O
cell B-TER
, O
although O
the O
prisoner B-TER
had O
been O
stripped O
. O

Once O
a O
German O
played O
a O
nasty O
trick O
on O
me O
. O

He O
put O
a O
pencil O
into O
my O
pocket O
without O
me O
noticing O
. O

The O
pencil O
was O
found O
, O
of O
course O
, O
at O
a O
control O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
must O
have O
seen O
from O
my O
surprised O
expression O
that O
I O
was O
dumbfounded O
. O

He O
did O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
otherwise O
this O
would O
have O
meant O
being O
put O
into O
a O
darkened O
cell B-TER
for O
me O
. O

In O
section O
AII O
there O
were O
strict O
rules O
about O
hygiene B-TER
– O
we O
had O
to O
shave O
and O
have O
a O
bath O
once O
a O
week O
; O
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
in O
the O
other O
sections O
. O

Those O
who O
worked B-TER
outside O
usually O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
shaved O
, O
which O
they O
used O
liberally O
. O

Such O
criminals B-TER
we O
were O
! O
Smoking O
was O
of O
course O
strictly O
forbidden O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
, O
but O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
cell B-TER
where O
we O
did O
not O
smoke O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
smoking O
was O
generally O
forbidden O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
people B-TER
smoked O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
described O
how O
we O
managed O
, O
not O
having O
any O
matches O
. O

Necessity O
is O
the O
mother O
of O
invention O
. O

In O
Pancrace B-LOC
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
play O
games O
like O
chess O
, O
dominoes O
, O
and O
nine O
men O
’s O
morris O
A O
board O
game O
for O
two O
players O
, O
also O
known O
as O
merels O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
this O
was O
forbidden O
, O
but O
we O
still O
played O
. O

Many O
a O
guard B-TER
turned O
a O
blind O
eye O
to O
this O
, O
others O
used O
it O
as O
a O
welcome O
opportunity O
to O
hit O
us O
. O

There O
was O
one O
guard B-TER
who O
searched O
the O
cell B-TER
every O
day O
; O
what O
he O
permitted O
one O
day O
he O
forbade O
the O
next O
. O

I O
had O
two O
bottles O
of O
different O
medicines B-TER
. O

He O
ordered O
me O
to O
pour O
these O
together O
into O
one O
bottle O
and O
give O
the O
second O
bottle O
to O
him O
. O

A O
small O
aluminium O
mug O
in O
which O
I O
kept O
my O
false O
teeth O
he O
threw O
away O
, O
telling O
me O
I O
could O
use O
my O
drinking O
mug O
instead O
. O

This O
man B-TER
was O
small O
and O
stunted O
with O
a O
deeply O
rooted O
inferiority O
complex O
. O

Here O
the O
guard B-TER
Prohaska B-PER
was O
remarkable O
for O
his O
correct O
behaviour O
. O

His O
demeanour O
was O
always O
measured O
, O
he O
never O
shouted O
, O
he O
was O
always O
a O
decent O
chap O
, O
a O
praiseworthy O
exception O
! O
Never O
lazy O
, O
nothing O
was O
too O
much O
[ O
trouble O
] O
for O
him O
and O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ I-TER
reactions O
. O

When O
Prohaska B-PER
was O
on O
duty O
the O
workers B-TER
never O
brought O
cigarettes O
back O
with O
them O
, O
and O
when O
he O
unexpectedly O
had O
to O
do O
an O
extra O
shift O
nobody O
smoked O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
. O

Nobody O
wanted O
to O
get O
him O
into O
trouble O
, O
since O
there O
was O
always O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
snap O
check O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
it O
was O
really O
unpleasant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
wc O
’s O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
. O

It O
was O
particularly O
unpleasant O
on O
Saturdays O
and O
Sundays O
. O

On O
these O
days O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
locked O
by O
noon O
, O
and O
they O
were O
not O
opened O
again O
until O
the O
following O
day O
. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
make O
do O
with O
one O
toilet O
bucket O
which O
was O
just O
big O
enough O
for O
one O
man B-TER
. O

That O
was O
impossible O
, O
as O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

Once O
a O
man B-TER
came O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
at O
6 O
pm O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
to O
let O
us O
slop O
out O
[ O
empty O
the O
bucket O
] O
because O
the O
bucket O
was O
overflowing O
. O

He O
refused O
, O
and O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
use O
our O
washbasin O
too O
. O

Even O
today O
I O
wonder O
why O
there O
was O
no O
epidemic B-TER
. O

When O
Prohaska B-PER
was O
on O
duty O
he O
came O
without O
being O
asked O
, O
and O
let O
us O
empty O
the O
bucket O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
there O
was O
no O
drinking O
water B-TER
in O
the O
cells B-TER
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
take O
water B-TER
from O
the O
bucket O
which O
was O
used O
for O
cleaning O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
all O
of O
us O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

Washing O
clothes B-TER
was O
also O
a O
problem O
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O

Some O
guards B-TER
allowed O
us O
to O
rinse O
our O
washing O
in O
the O
laundry B-TER
but O
most O
did O
not O
. O

We O
were O
dependent O
on O
moods O
! O
I O
leave O
it O
to O
the O
reader O
to O
imagine O
what O
sometimes O
resulted O
from O
these O
conditions O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
exercise O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
yard O
was O
also O
on O
the O
agenda O
, O
but O
often O
, O
far O
too O
often O
, O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
instead O
, O
and O
often O
daily O
for O
a O
whole O
week O
, O
so O
that O
we O
had O
to O
do O
without O
the O
necessary O
fresh O
air O
. O

Very O
often O
the O
exercise O
was O
anything O
but O
recreation O
: O
we O
were O
hounded O
as O
if O
we O
had O
to O
set O
a O
record O
. O

Then O
we O
returned O
to O
our O
cell B-TER
, O
completely O
exhausted O
. O

We O
threw O
ourselves O
down O
onto O
the O
floor O
because O
sitting O
on O
the O
palliasses O
was O
forbidden O
. O

Often O
after O
such O
an O
event O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
as O
well O
. O

Every O
guard B-TER
was O
a O
law O
unto O
himself O
. O

One O
allowed O
paper O
cartons O
to O
put O
the O
washing O
in O
, O
another O
threw O
them O
out O
. O

A O
few O
allowed O
us O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
palliasses O
since O
there O
was O
only O
one O
stool O
and O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
room O
for O
so O
many O
prisoners B-TER
to O
sit O
down O
. O

There O
were O
guards B-TER
who O
were O
really O
inventive O
as O
far O
as O
torturing B-TER
us O
during O
our O
exercise O
periods O
was O
concerned O
. O

When O
I O
said O
once O
to O
a O
guard B-TER
that O
the O
treatment O
here O
was O
worse O
than O
in O
the O
KZ B-TER
, O
he O
answered O
that O
it O
was O
in O
a O
KZ B-TER
that O
he O
had O
learnt O
it O
. O

From O
then O
, O
whenever O
he O
was O
on O
duty O
I O
had O
to O
keep O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

As O
already O
mentioned O
I O
could O
have O
sent O
letters B-TER
if O
I O
had O
had O
stamps O
or O
money B-TER
. O

But O
how O
could O
I O
get O
money B-TER
or O
stamps O
? O
That O
was O
sheer O
sadism O
. O

They O
had O
taken O
away O
my O
450 O
Czech B-LOC
crowns B-TER
. O

Now O
I O
wrote O
some O
letters B-TER
and O
mentioned O
this O
money B-TER
. O

Some O
months O
later O
the O
trusty O
showed O
me O
the O
letters B-TER
– O
they O
had O
not O
been O
posted O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
had O
not O
even O
tried O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
find O
another O
way O
to O
order O
a O
food B-TER
parcel O
– O
we O
could O
not O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
. O

So O
I O
wanted O
to O
smuggle B-TER
a O
letter B-TER
out O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
. O

I O
gave O
this O
letter B-TER
secretly O
to O
a O
Czech B-LOC
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
. O

A O
German B-LOC
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
who O
had O
been O
the O
Managing O
Director O
of O
the O
Raiffeisenbank B-ORG
in O
Prague B-LOC
gave O
me O
away O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
did O
slap O
me O
but O
he O
was O
fair O
and O
did O
not O
report O
me O
. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
write O
in O
order O
to O
get O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
since O
he O
had O
not O
posted O
my O
letters B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
that O
was O
why O
he O
refrained O
from O
reporting O
me O
, O
and O
also O
because O
the O
letter B-TER
was O
addressed O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
secretly O
because O
the O
director O
was O
generous O
in O
allowing O
us O
to O
send O
letters B-TER
; O
he O
even O
paid O
for O
my O
stamps O
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
relief O
to O
meet O
this O
man B-TER
– O
he O
treated O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
as O
human O
beings O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
every O
prisoner B-TER
had O
to O
tell O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
in O
advance O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
director O
about O
, O
so O
complaints O
were O
hardly O
possible O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
the O
director O
would O
have O
stopped O
that O
at O
once O
. O

I O
know O
about O
one O
case O
when O
the O
prisoner B-TER
invented O
something O
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
. O

When O
at O
last O
he O
was O
received O
by O
the O
director O
he O
complained O
about O
being O
repeatedly O
maltreated O
. O

On O
the O
way O
back O
to O
his O
cell B-TER
the O
guard B-TER
led O
him O
to O
his O
office O
and O
mistreated O
the O
poor O
chap O
so O
much O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
back O
to O
his O
cell B-TER
. O

If O
the O
prisoners B-TER
had O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
do O
what O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
according O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
rules O
or O
by O
the O
director O
there O
would O
have O
been O
fewer O
punishments B-TER
. O

The O
guard B-TER
was O
the O
power O
, O
the O
prisoner B-TER
had O
no O
rights O
. O

I O
will O
always O
have O
fond O
memories O
of O
the O
director O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
to O
him O
that O
I O
owed O
contact O
with O
my O
sons O
. O

On O
22 O
June O
1946 O
I O
wrote O
to O
the O
examining O
magistrate O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
in O
order O
to O
learn O
what O
I O
was O
accused O
of O
, O
so O
that O
I O
might O
be O
able O
to O
comment O
on O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
my O
arrest B-TER
. O

I O
received O
no O
reply O
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
the O
examining O
magistrate O
told O
me O
that O
he O
had O
never O
had O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
me O
, O
there O
had O
never O
been O
a O
file O
on O
me O
. O

On O
2 O
October O
I O
had O
a O
longer O
discussion O
with O
the O
guard B-TER
who O
was O
my O
boss O
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
he O
brought O
me O
paper O
and O
ink O
, O
thus O
giving O
me O
the O
opportunity O
to O
submit O
a O
petition O
to O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
. O

He O
later O
handed O
it O
personally O
to O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
. O

Whenever O
he O
went O
off O
duty O
he O
took O
with O
him O
what O
I O
had O
written O
in O
order O
to O
give O
it O
back O
to O
me O
when O
he O
came O
to O
work B-TER
. O

In O
this O
petition O
I O
described O
my O
fate O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
gave O
the O
names O
of O
about O
twenty O
Czechs B-LOC
who O
were O
in O
public O
life O
. O

The O
public O
prosecutor O
ordered O
these O
witnesses O
to O
be O
heard O
. O

Unfortunately O
they O
lived O
in O
different O
areas O
, O
all O
over O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
and O
of O
course O
I O
did O
not O
know O
their O
precise O
addresses O
. O

So O
the O
whole O
procedure O
took O
longer O
than O
expected O
. O

My O
file O
was O
sent O
to O
Prague B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
witness O
General O
Dr O
Pollak B-PER
was O
heard O
, O
then O
they O
came O
back O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

After O
that O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
[ O
Brno B-LOC
] O
. O

When O
four O
of O
the O
witnesses O
named O
by O
me O
had O
been O
heard O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
did O
not O
want O
to O
listen O
to O
any O
others O
and O
ordered O
my O
release B-TER
. O

On O
9 O
January O
1947 O
I O
was O
taken O
before O
the O
examining O
magistrate O
who O
said O
to O
me O
: O
There O
is O
nothing O
here O
held O
against O
you O
, O
you O
may O
go O
wherever O
you O
wish O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Czechoslovakia O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
you O
should O
not O
. O

There O
are O
no O
restrictions O
. O

You O
are O
free O
! O
When O
I O
said O
to O
him O
that O
that O
would O
have O
been O
easier O
nineteen O
months O
ago O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
I O
am O
not O
responsible O
for O
this O
. O

I O
did O
not O
even O
know O
that O
you O
existed O
. O

I O
have O
never O
seen O
your O
file O
, O
there O
is O
n’t O
one O
. O

There O
is O
too O
much O
work O
for O
too O
few O
judges O
, O
which O
is O
completely O
preventing O
regular O
work O
. O

We O
dealt O
with O
those O
cases O
where O
the O
person O
concerned O
got O
in O
touch O
. O

The O
others O
did O
not O
get O
done O
. O

Unfortunately O
you O
were O
amongst O
these O
. O

That O
was O
pretty O
cold O
comfort O
! O
When O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
my O
case O
to O
be O
first O
to O
be O
dealt O
with O
, O
he O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
. O

He O
said O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
could O
understand O
my O
anger O
, O
particularly O
since O
I O
had O
suffered O
so O
much O
. O

But O
that O
would O
not O
help O
me O
. O

I O
should O
try O
to O
get O
compensation B-TER
for O
wrongful O
imprisonment B-TER
. O

There O
I O
was O
on O
the O
street O
, O
without O
any O
money B-TER
. O

An O
icy O
wind O
hit O
me O
. O

I O
did O
as O
the O
magistrate O
had O
suggested O
and O
went O
to O
the O
house O
he O
had O
described O
. O

And O
in O
this O
house O
lived O
a O
family B-TER
Bobeck B-PER
with O
whom O
I O
had O
been O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

They O
did O
not O
know O
that O
I O
had O
been O
in O
prison B-TER
, O
nor O
that O
I O
had O
been O
so O
very O
close O
by O
. O

They O
immediately O
offered O
me O
a O
room B-TER
and O
also O
a O
considerable O
sum O
of O
money B-TER
. O

I O
was O
safe O
! O
Two O
days O
later O
I O
went O
to O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Here O
I O
was O
given O
accommodation B-TER
by O
a O
Mr O
Paul B-PER
Schlesinger I-PER
, O
who O
had O
never O
met O
me O
before O
, O
having O
only O
heard O
about O
me O
. O

In O
the O
street O
I O
met O
people B-TER
I O
had O
known O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
none O
of O
whom O
knew O
I O
had O
been O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
accept O
all O
the O
invitations O
I O
received O
. O

First O
I O
had O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
good O
food B-TER
and O
all O
the O
hurly O
- O
burly O
. O

Only O
now O
did O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
was O
really O
free B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
my O
precipitate O
arrest B-TER
I O
had O
lost O
the O
few O
belongings O
the O
SS B-ORG
had O
left O
me O
. O

A O
petition O
to O
the O
Czechoslovakian B-LOC
government B-TER
was O
refused O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
decree B-TER
of O
President O
Benesch B-PER
. O

This O
decree B-TER
states O
that O
compensation B-TER
is O
not O
paid O
and O
that O
people B-TER
spreading O
libellous O
gossip O
must O
not O
be O
sued O
. O

But O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities O
, O
too O
, O
refused O
to O
pay O
any O
compensation B-TER
for O
nineteen O
months O
’ O
arrest B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
the O
Czechs B-LOC
provided O
me O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
support O
. O

They O
even O
offered O
me O
a O
pension O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

But O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
strong O
enough O
the O
ecumenical B-TER
organisation O
sent O
me O
to O
England B-LOC
by O
air O
. O

Berlin B-LOC

Lichtenberg I-LOC
I O
was O
born O
on O
30.6.1923 O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
as O
a O
full O
Jew O
, O
daughter O
of O
the O
businessman B-TER
Julius B-PER
Finke I-PER
and O
his O
wife B-TER
Ella B-PER
, O
nee O
Kallmann B-PER
. O

After O
spending O
the O
first O
ten O
years O
of O
my O
life O
growing O
up O
without O
a O
care O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
year O
1933 O
arrived O
and O
Hitler B-PER
came O
to O
power O
. O

There O
was O
a O
polling O
station O
in O
the O
building B-TER
in O
which O
we O
were O
living O
, O
and O
unfortunately O
on O
polling O
day O
in O
1933 O
I O
was O
playing O
near O
the O
window O
in O
one O
of O
our O
rooms B-TER
with O
some O
quark O
. O

I O
was O
cooking O
like O
children B-TER
used O
to O
do O
. O

How O
it O
came O
about O
that O
I O
let O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
this O
stuff O
drip O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
I O
still O
can O
not O
explain O
to O
this O
day O
, O
however O
that O
is O
what O
happened O
, O
and O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
there O
was O
a O
ring O
on O
our O
doorbell O
. O

My O
father O
opened O
the O
door O
and O
there O
in O
front O
of O
him O
stood O
a O
Storm B-TER
Trooper I-TER
, O
who O
immediately O
rushed O
into O
the O
apartment B-TER
right O
across O
the O
room B-TER
to O
the O
open O
window O
, O
whistled O
down O
below O
and O
asked O
: O
Was O
it O
here O
? O
to O
which O
the O
answer O
came O
that O
it O
was O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
should O
mention O
that O
a O
Storm B-TER
Trooper I-TER
with O
an O
advertising O
poster O
had O
been O
standing O
outside O
the O
door O
of O
the O
polling O
station O
all O
day O
. O

The O
fellow O
in O
our O
apartment B-TER
then O
said O
to O
my O
father O
that O
15 O
drops O
of O
corrosive O
acid O
had O
been O
poured O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
on O
he O
blackmailed O
my O
father O
by O
threatening B-TER
to O
send O
him O
straight O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Six O
months O
later O
we O
moved O
to O
Halensee B-LOC
to O
be O
rid O
of O
the O
fellow O
. O

At O
Easter O
1933 O
I O
was O
due O
to O
move O
to O
the O
Victoria B-TER
- I-TER
Oberlyceum I-TER
, O
after O
having O
spent O
four O
years O
at O
the O
elementary B-TER
school I-TER
. O

As O
we O
did O
not O
know O
at O
first O
whether O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
still O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
senior B-TER
schools I-TER
, O
I O
spent O
a O
month O
of O
the O
new O
school B-TER
year O
still O
in O
the O
elementary B-TER
school I-TER
, O
after O
which O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Margareten B-TER
- I-TER
Lyzeum I-TER
in O
Iffland B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

Here O
there O
were O
approximately O
14 O
of O
us O
Jewish O
girls O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
under O
the O
class B-TER
teacher O
, O
Herr B-TER
Kochanowsky B-PER
the O
senior O
primary B-TER
school I-TER
teacher O
, O
was O
so O
poor O
, O
that O
in O
October O
I O
begged O
my O
parents O
to O
send O
me O
to O
a O
Jewish B-TER
school I-TER
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
did O
. O

As O
a O
result O
I O
then O
started O
going O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
Middle I-TER
School I-TER
at O
27 B-LOC
, I-LOC
Grosse I-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
had O
lost O
his O
job B-TER
as O
company O
secretary O
of O
a O
department O
store O
, O
as O
the O
Jewish O
proprietor O
gave O
up O
the O
business B-TER
. O

So O
, O
like O
many O
Jews O
, O
my O
father O
was O
unemployed O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
work B-TER
. O

He O
then O
did O
various O
temporary O
jobs B-TER
and O
agency B-TER
work I-TER
; O
when O
that O
was O
no O
longer O
available O
either O
, O
he O
worked B-TER
on O
a O
voluntary O
basis O
for O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
, O
until O
in O
1937 O
he O
got O
a O
permanent O
job B-TER
as O
a O
tax B-TER
consultant O
for O
those O
wanting O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

As O
everyone O
was O
thinking O
about O
emigrating B-TER
, O
my O
parents O
took O
me O
out O
of O
school B-TER
early O
, O
in O
October O
1937 O
, O
so O
that O
I O
, O
like O
my O
brother O
Hans B-PER
who O
was O
born O
in O
1920 O
, O
and O
who O
was O
already O
training O
as O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
, O
could O
learn O
a O
trade B-TER
. O

As O
I O
was O
quite O
skilful O
, O
my O
parents O
sent O
me O
to O
train O
in O
a O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
, O
where O
I O
began O
to O
learn B-TER
dressmaking B-TER
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
was O
also O
a O
Jewish O
lady B-TER
, O
and O
so O
in O
January O
1939 O
, O
like O
all O
German B-LOC
Jewish O
trades B-TER
people B-TER
she O
had O
to O
close B-TER
the O
business B-TER
. O

I O
then O
went O
to O
a O
fashion B-TER
school I-TER
and O
learned O
cutting O
. O

By O
the O
time O
this O
course O
had O
finished O
, O
Jewish O
girls O
were O
only O
permitted O
to O
go O
into O
service O
, O
and O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
take O
a O
job B-TER
doing O
housework B-TER
in O
a O
Jewish O
guesthouse B-TER
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
had O
been O
given O
notice O
to O
quit O
our O
home B-TER
following O
Kristallnacht B-TER
in O
1938 O
. O

Our O
neighbours O
were O
party B-TER
members I-TER
and O
had O
told O
the O
landlord O
that O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
live O
under O
the O
same O
roof O
as O
Jews O
. O

My O
mother O
once O
went O
to O
speak O
to O
our O
neighbour O
and O
asked O
her O
what O
she O
had O
against O
us O
, O
whereupon O
the O
neighbour O
replied O
that O
she O
had O
nothing O
against O
us O
herself O
, O
but O
the O
Führer O
had O
had O
bad O
experiences O
with O
Jews O
! O
Until O
1st O
January O
1940 O
I O
had O
the O
great O
good O
fortune O
to O
have O
had O
a O
place O
arranged O
for O
me O
through O
a O
friend O
in O
a O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
, O
which O
a O
Jewish O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
was O
allowed O
to O
continue O
to O
run O
; O
she O
registered B-TER
me O
as O
employed B-TER
to O
do O
housework B-TER
, O
although O
I O
did O
do O
sewing O
after O
all O
, O
so O
that O
in O
my O
job B-TER
I O
was O
able O
to O
complete O
the O
part O
of O
my O
apprenticeship O
that O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
finished O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
lady B-TER
was O
deported B-TER
on O
the O
first O
Jewish O
transport B-TER
in O
1941 O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
from O
that O
time O
onwards O
, O
Jews O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Jewish O
units O
into O
which O
they O
had O
been O
conscripted O
, O
therefore O
no O
longer O
in O
private O
employment B-TER
. O

In O
May O
1939 O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
allocated O
us O
an O
apartment B-TER
with O
two O
rooms B-TER
in O
a O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
house O
- O
in O
a O
tenement O
with O
a O
W.C. B-TER
on O
the O
stairs O
. O

We O
were O
just O
pleased O
not O
to O
have O
to O
share O
with O
other O
people B-TER
, O
which O
with O
4 O
of O
us O
going O
out O
to O
work B-TER
would O
have O
been O
particularly O
difficult O
. O

On O
19th O
September O
1941 O
the O
law B-TER
was O
passed O
which O
stated O
that O
every O
Jew O
was O
obliged O
to O
wear O
a O
Yellow O
Star O
of O
David O
. O

Then O
Jews O
were O
no B-TER
longer I-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
use I-TER
public I-TER
transport I-TER
or O
visit B-TER
places I-TER
of O
cultural B-TER
interest I-TER
etc O
. O

Typewriters O
, O
radios B-TER
, O
all O
electrical O
equipment O
, O
even O
irons O
, O
had O
to O
be O
surrendered B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
jewellery O
etc O
. O

This O
latter O
had O
already O
taken O
place O
after O
Kristallnacht B-TER
. O

After O
I O
lost O
my O
job B-TER
with O
the O
Jewish O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
, O
where O
in O
addition O
to O
me O
a O
certain O
Ruth B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
, O
a O
Turkish B-LOC
Jew O
, O
worked B-TER
with O
whom O
I O
had O
become O
very O
friendly O
, O
I O
was O
given O
compulsory O
work B-TER
at O
Moeller O
, O
a O
firm B-TER
manufacturing O
ready O
– O
to O
- O
wear O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
coats B-TER
in O
Schützen B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

In O
this O
Jewish O
unit O
about O
30 O
- O
50 O
Jewish O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
worked B-TER
( O
today O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
say O
exactly O
how O
many O
) O
. O

It O
was O
piecework O
, O
and O
about O
3.75 O
marks B-TER
were O
paid O
for O
a O
completed O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
coat B-TER
. O

The O
deportations B-TER
were O
still O
going O
on O
and O
so O
the O
time O
came O
when O
nearly O
every O
day O
one O
colleague O
or O
another O
was O
missing O
and O
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

By O
now O
it O
was O
February O
1943 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
, O
like O
my O
mother O
, O
had O
been O
given O
compulsory B-TER
work I-TER
in O
a O
factory B-TER
. O

They O
earned O
extremely O
little O
; O
food B-TER
, O
which O
we O
had O
to O
buy O
on O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
, O
was O
so O
expensive O
, O
that O
we O
could O
barely O
afford O
it O
. O

With O
ration B-TER
cards I-TER
we O
got O
neither O
meat B-TER
nor O
butter B-TER
, O
nor O
fish B-TER
nor O
white B-TER
bread I-TER
. O

Several O
of O
the O
shopkeepers O
gave O
my O
mother O
something O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
in O
return O
for O
which O
she O
gave O
them O
clothing B-TER
or O
other O
things O
from O
the O
household O
to O
show O
her O
gratitude O
. O

We O
had O
had O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
most O
of O
our O
furnishings O
when O
we O
moved O
from O
Halensee B-LOC
into O
the O
one O
and O
a O
half O
room O
apartment B-TER
in O
1939 O
. O

As O
deportation B-TER
was O
a O
daily O
threat O
for O
us O
too O
, O
we O
trembled O
at O
each O
heavy O
footstep O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
and O
her O
parents O
put O
pressure O
on O
me O
to O
start O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
, O
because O
as O
Turks B-LOC
the O
Jewish O
Laws B-TER
did O
not O
apply O
to O
them O
at O
present O
, O
to O
move O
in O
with O
them O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
constant O
pressure O
, O
with O
my O
nerves O
in O
a O
complete O
state O
of O
collapse O
as O
separation B-TER
from O
my O
parents O
seemed O
to O
me O
almost O
impossible O
, O
on O
25 O
February O
1943 O
I O
pulled O
myself O
together O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
who O
were O
also O
illegally B-TER
sheltering I-TER
a O
girl O
friend O
of O
their O
son O
as O
well O
as O
me O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
could O
still O
be O
separated B-TER
from O
my O
parents O
by O
deportation B-TER
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

On O
27th O
February O
, O
a O
Sunday O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Fabrik O
- O
Aktion O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
took O
place O
, O
during O
which O
every O
Jew O
was O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
factories B-TER
, O
loaded O
onto O
lorries O
and O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

My O
parents O
were O
among O
them O
. O

My O
brother O
, O
who O
had O
just O
had O
his O
appendix B-TER
out O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Hospital I-TER
, O
was O
also O
deported B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
two O
weeks O
later O
. O

As O
a O
qualified O
electrical O
engineer O
he O
was O
segregated O
with O
different O
workmates B-TER
, O
who O
had O
all O
already O
been O
doing O
compulsory O
work B-TER
together O
at O
Siemens B-ORG
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
had O
to O
put O
electrical O
installations O
in O
the O
villas B-TER
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
officials B-TER
there O
and O
maintain O
the O
power O
lines O
etc O
under O
the O
worst O
possible O
conditions O
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-LOC
approached O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
moved O
away O
. O

For O
ten O
days O
my O
brother O
lived O
off O
melted O
snow O
in O
a O
goods O
train B-TER
with O
80 O
people B-TER
in O
one O
wagon B-TER
, O
dressed B-TER
only O
in O
his O
drill O
suit B-TER
; O
he O
then O
came O
via O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
and O
Flossenbürg B-LOC
to O
Belsen B-LOC
, O
where O
, O
half B-TER
- I-TER
dead I-TER
, O
he O
was O
then O
released B-TER
and O
, O
praise O
God B-TER
, O
survived B-TER
. O

Some O
days O
after O
the O
Fabrik B-TER
- O
Aktion B-TER
a O
colleague O
of O
my O
mother O
’s O
, O
who O
was O
in O
a O
mixed B-TER
marriage I-TER
and O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
with O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
brought O
a O
card B-TER
which O
my O
mother O
had O
thrown O
from O
a O
goods O
wagon B-TER
travelling O
through O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
on O
which O
she O
had O
written O
a O
few O
lines O
. O

A O
lady B-TER
had O
found O
the O
card B-TER
in O
the O
open O
countryside O
and O
had O
put O
it O
in O
an O
envelope B-TER
and O
added O
a O
few O
lines O
to O
say O
that O
the O
card B-TER
had O
been O
thrown O
from O
a O
train B-TER
in O
this O
way O
and O
had O
undersigned O
it O
with O
the O
words O
: O
A O
woman O
, O
who O
still O
thinks O
like O
a O
human O
being O
. O

No O
further O
indications O
of O
life O
came O
from O
either O
my O
mother O
or O
my O
father O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
’s I-PER
aunt O
, O
who O
had O
also O
been O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
had O
been O
recognised O
and O
arrested B-TER
by O
an O
informer B-TER
( O
a O
certain O
lawyer B-TER
Jacob O
) O
, O
had O
had O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
’ I-PER
address O
on O
her O
, O
and O
so O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
correctly O
assumed O
that O
illegals O
were O
to O
be O
found O
there O
. O

One O
day O
– O
it O
must O
have O
been O
in O
July O
1943 O
- O
they O
burst O
into O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
’ I-PER
home B-TER
, O
the O
cleaner O
was O
wiping O
the O
front O
door O
to O
the O
apartment B-TER
, O
and O
found O
not O
only O
me O
but O
also O
the O
girlfriend O
of O
Ori B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
, O
a O
certain O
Sonja B-PER
Weissbrot I-PER
. O

This O
latter O
passed O
herself O
off O
as O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
neighbour O
( O
Christin O
, O
who O
knew O
about O
us O
) O
, O
and O
she O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
because O
the O
neighbour O
stated O
that O
she O
was O
her O
daughter O
. O

It O
was O
Kommissar O
Wenzel B-PER
and O
among O
others O
, O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
who O
then O
dealt O
with O
me O
. O

The O
Jacobsons B-PER
had O
been O
able O
to O
buy O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
on O
the O
quiet O
. O

Thanks O
to O
an O
acquaintance O
who O
had O
only O
one O
Jewish O
and O
three O
Christian B-TER
grandparents O
– O
so O
did O
not O
come O
under O
the O
Jewish O
laws B-TER
– O
I O
still O
had O
these O
with O
me O
in O
her O
name O
, O
to O
use O
as O
possible O
identification B-TER
at O
an O
identity O
check O
, O
as O
I O
had O
no O
other O
identity B-TER
papers I-TER
. O

As O
it O
was O
necessary O
I O
now O
showed O
these O
cards B-TER
and O
said O
I O
was O
the O
acquaintance O
. O

At O
first O
they O
wanted O
to O
take O
me O
with O
them O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
assembly O
point O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
took O
a O
fancy O
to O
me O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
would O
meet O
him O
, O
to O
which O
I O
naturally O
said O
I O
would O
and O
that O
I O
could O
then O
bring O
my O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
with O
me O
and O
, O
oh O
what O
a O
miracle O
, O
they O
did O
not O
take O
me O
with O
them O
, O
but O
ordered O
me O
to O
go O
a O
few O
days O
later O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
with O
my O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
naturally O
. O

I O
told O
the O
girl B-TER
first O
of O
all O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
we O
arranged O
that O
, O
should O
she O
be O
approached O
by O
someone O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
she O
would O
deny O
all O
knowledge O
of O
any O
of O
this O
and O
also O
of O
me O
, O
and O
as O
in O
any O
case O
I O
now O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
did O
not O
approach O
her O
at O
all O
, O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
go O
to O
the O
rendezvous O
with O
the O
informer B-TER
. O

Herr B-TER
Jacobson B-PER
, O
without O
the O
knowledge O
of O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
was O
behind O
us O
all O
the O
time O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
help O
me O
if O
necessary O
. O

We O
met O
as O
arranged O
in O
the O
Alexanderplatz B-LOC
railway B-TER
station O
, O
and O
I O
was O
sure O
of O
only O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
I O
had O
to O
make O
certain O
at O
all O
costs O
that O
the O
fellow O
vouched O
for O
me O
in O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
told O
them O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
and O
that O
it O
was O
therefore O
not O
necessary O
for O
me O
to O
appear O
there O
. O

The O
fellow O
kept O
on O
and O
on O
at O
me O
and O
told O
me O
that O
his O
wife B-TER
was O
away O
so O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
safe O
to O
go O
to O
his O
apartment B-TER
at O
27 B-LOC
Weissenburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
on O
the O
following O
Sunday O
. O

I O
said O
that O
I O
would O
go O
, O
on O
condition O
that O
I O
did O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
and O
as O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
very O
keen O
on O
me O
, O
he O
agreed O
and O
we O
said O
goodbye O
. O

The O
lass O
was O
not O
bothered O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
on O
my O
account O
, O
thank O
God B-TER
, O
even O
if O
nothing O
would O
have O
happened O
to O
her O
as O
she O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
( O
allegedly O
) O
, O
but O
of O
course O
it O
was O
much O
better O
for O
her O
this O
way O
. O

I O
wrote O
a O
letter B-TER
to O
the O
informer B-TER
saying O
that O
I O
would O
not O
come O
on O
Sunday O
as O
arranged O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
he O
had O
already O
vouched O
for O
me O
. O

To O
my O
great O
misfortune O
however O
, O
some O
days O
later O
this O
girl B-TER
was O
ordered O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
because O
of O
another O
Jewish O
boy O
living B-TER
illegally I-TER
who O
had O
her O
address O
with O
him O
, O
and O
there O
it O
was O
established O
that O
I O
had O
not O
been O
The O
Right O
One O
on O
the O
previous O
occasion O
, O
and O
this O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
I O
therefore O
must O
also O
be O
an O
illegal B-TER
, O
and O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
who O
had O
been O
very O
angry O
that O
I O
had O
stood O
him O
up O
that O
time O
, O
became O
even O
angrier O
still O
that O
I O
had O
got O
away O
from O
him O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
now O
had O
to O
disappear O
immediately O
from O
the O
Jacobson B-PER
family B-TER
. O

The O
Jacobsons B-PER
had O
a O
longstanding O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
I O
had O
met O
at O
birthday O
celebrations O
etc O
, O
and O
who O
in O
the O
meantime O
was O
also O
living B-TER
illegally I-TER
with O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
and O
visited O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
, O
as O
she O
was O
called O
, O
left O
her O
clothes B-TER
with O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
and O
me O
for O
mending O
, O
as O
we O
also O
used O
to O
do O
sewing O
together O
when O
I O
was O
staying B-TER
there O
illegally B-TER
. O

Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
asked O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
one O
day O
where O
she O
had O
her O
mending O
done O
, O
and O
whether O
we O
would O
do O
any O
for O
her O
, O
which O
of O
course O
we O
were O
pleased O
to O
do O
. O

This O
is O
how O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
came O
to O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
heard O
about O
me O
and O
saw O
me O
and O
said O
to O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
, O
before O
I O
had O
even O
started O
thinking O
about O
leaving O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
that O
she O
would O
take O
me O
in O
straight O
away O
too O
, O
even O
though O
apart O
from O
Lola B-PER
, O
another O
Jewish O
girl B-TER
was O
also O
housed B-TER
at O
the O
Dänes B-PER
. O

The O
question O
as O
to O
where O
I O
should O
go O
was O
now O
becoming O
urgent O
, O
and O
we O
got O
in O
touch O
with O
Lola B-PER
and O
asked O
whether O
the O
Dänes B-PER
would O
now O
stand O
by O
their O
word O
and O
take O
me O
in O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
unbelievably O
they O
did O
take O
me O
in O
as O
well O
, O
even O
though O
I O
was O
the O
third O
one O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
lived O
in O
a O
detached O
house O
in O
Conradshöhe O
, O
a O
villa O
suburb O
of O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
in O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
's I-PER
parents O
’ O
house B-TER
; O
they O
were O
also O
in O
agreement O
with O
this O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
owned O
three O
lending O
libraries B-TER
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
worked B-TER
in O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
Dänes B-PER
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
employed B-TER
in O
the O
second O
one O
, O
and O
I O
said O
I O
would O
. O

Lola B-PER
’s I-PER
shop O
was O
at O
the O
station O
on O
Frankfurter B-LOC
( O
now O
Stalin O
) O
Allee O
. O

The O
shop O
in O
which O
I O
worked B-TER
was O
in O
Moabit B-LOC
, O
an O
area O
in O
which O
I O
was O
not O
known O
. O

As O
the O
bombing B-TER
was O
becoming O
increasingly O
heavy O
, O
many O
people B-TER
were O
spending O
the O
night O
in O
the O
suburbs O
to O
escape B-TER
the O
dangers O
; O
it O
certainly O
was O
not O
the O
case O
that O
we O
used O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
each O
day O
. O

In O
the O
suburbs O
we O
said O
that O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
city O
and O
were O
registered B-TER
there O
and O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
the O
suburbs O
because O
of O
the O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
, O
and O
in O
the O
city O
we O
said O
that O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
suburbs O
, O
so O
that O
no O
one O
would O
become O
suspicious O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
had O
left O
me O
a O
library B-TER
card O
and O
a O
work B-TER
book O
which O
had O
belonged O
to O
a O
former O
Christian B-TER
employee O
, O
who O
was O
still O
registered B-TER
with O
them O
. O

( O
This O
employee O
, O
who O
had O
a O
child B-TER
, O
was O
quite O
happy O
about O
this O
, O
as O
otherwise O
she O
would O
have O
been O
given O
compulsory B-TER
work I-TER
elsewhere O
, O
and O
in O
this O
way O
she O
was O
still O
regarded O
as O
being O
employed B-TER
) O
. O

So O
, O
in O
August O
1943 O
I O
came O
to O
the O
Däne B-PER
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
and O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
trained O
me O
and O
, O
as O
I O
had O
read O
a O
lot O
in O
any O
case O
, O
working B-TER
in O
the O
library B-TER
presented O
me O
with O
few O
difficulties O
and O
much O
pleasure O
. O

People B-TER
were O
happy O
to O
be O
served O
by O
me O
, O
I O
reserved O
good O
books B-TER
for O
them O
, O
and O
if O
I O
went O
shopping O
with O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
’s I-TER
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
more O
of O
everything O
that O
was O
on O
all O
the O
cards B-TER
, O
and O
even O
here O
and O
there O
something O
extra O
, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
also O
contribute O
something O
to O
the O
household O
budget O
. O

Herr B-TER
Däne B-PER
had O
also O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
contacts O
so O
that O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
go O
hungry B-TER
. O

Except O
for O
the O
constant O
persecution B-TER
mania O
from O
which O
I O
suffered O
, O
the O
year O
passed O
quite O
well O
in O
this O
way O
until O
8th O
August O
1944 O
. O

After O
closing O
the O
shop O
I O
would O
always O
meet O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
at O
the O
Gesundbrunnen B-LOC
station I-LOC
to O
go O
together O
with O
her O
on O
the O
only O
tram O
, O
number O
28 O
or O
128 O
, O
which O
went O
from O
there O
to O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
Däne B-PER
. O

We O
always O
met O
at O
the O
circle O
line O
barrier O
. O

At O
this O
time O
of O
day O
there O
was O
always O
a O
terrible O
crush O
. O

Among O
hundreds O
of O
people B-TER
, O
no O
one O
could O
go O
forwards O
or O
backwards O
, O
on O
this O
particular O
day O
someone O
grabbed O
my O
arm O
– O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
. O

I O
froze O
. O

He O
led O
me O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
past O
Lola B-PER
who O
was O
also O
frozen O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
but O
who O
he O
did O
not O
know O
, O
thank O
God B-TER
. O

As O
I O
had O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards B-TER
with O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
names O
with O
me O
in O
my O
handbag O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
throw O
these O
away O
so O
that O
Lola B-PER
could O
pick O
them O
up O
, O
but O
Behrend B-PER
only O
said O
, O
Pick O
them O
up O
! O
He O
pushed O
me O
along O
the O
passage O
there O
, O
gripping O
my O
arm O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

I O
begged O
him O
to O
let O
me O
go O
, O
as O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
gain O
from O
seizing O
me O
, O
but O
he O
only O
answered O
with O
an O
icy O
, O
No O
! O
Platforms O
for O
trains B-TER
in O
all O
different O
directions O
lead O
off O
the O
passage O
I O
mentioned O
. O

He O
pulled O
me O
onto O
the O
last O
platform O
, O
where O
he O
met O
a O
man B-TER
, O
who O
I O
later O
learned O
was O
a O
certain O
Kommissar O
Tietze B-PER
. O

As O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
who O
was O
coming O
with O
Behrend B-PER
, O
this O
latter O
was O
obliged O
to O
tell O
him O
about O
me O
. O

He O
therefore O
let O
me O
go O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
said O
, O
If O
you O
carry O
on O
making O
a O
fuss O
, O
I O
’ll O
slap O
you O
so O
hard O
that O
you O
’ll O
fly O
into O
the O
wall O
! O
Full O
of O
despair O
, O
I O
took O
stock O
of O
my O
life O
and O
knew O
, O
that O
they O
would O
first O
beat O
me O
half O
to O
death B-TER
and O
then O
pack O
me O
off O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

As O
I O
had O
sworn O
to O
myself O
not O
to O
let O
these O
dogs O
kill B-TER
me O
, O
and O
as O
well O
was O
feverishly O
working O
out O
how O
I O
could O
destroy O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
, O
the O
approaching O
S B-TER
- I-TER
Bahn I-TER
train I-TER
appeared O
to O
be O
my O
salvation O
, O
and O
with O
one O
jump O
I O
threw O
myself O
under O
the O
train B-TER
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
when O
someone O
called O
, O
Turn O
off O
the O
current O
. O

Lying O
under O
the O
train B-TER
I O
heard O
an O
excited O
crowd O
on O
the O
platform O
who O
probably O
assumed O
I O
had O
acted O
out O
of O
lovesickness O
and O
who O
were O
now O
grumbling O
that O
I O
fully O
deserved O
a O
good O
hiding B-TER
etc O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
out O
of O
my O
mind O
, O
felt O
no O
pain O
, O
just O
despair O
at O
still O
being O
alive O
and O
cried O
out O
, O
You O
should O
try O
being O
persecuted O
like O
a O
Jew O
sometime O
! O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
two O
rail O
workers B-TER
came O
along O
and O
pulled O
me O
out O
from O
between O
two O
coaches B-TER
, O
together O
with O
my O
bag O
which O
was O
unscathed O
. O

Behrend B-PER
was O
feeling O
rather O
uncomfortable O
and O
he O
said O
to O
me O
, O
But O
we O
are O
good O
people O
, O
we O
would O
have O
let O
you O
get O
away O
, O
whereupon O
I O
replied O
, O
still O
unaware O
of O
the O
injury B-TER
to O
my O
foot O
, O
Well O
, O
then O
let O
me O
get O
away O
! O
At O
this O
Behrend B-PER
just O
smirked O
at O
me O
and O
said O
, O
You O
certainly O
ca O
n’t O
do O
that O
now O
! O
I O
was O
carried O
to O
the O
waiting O
room O
on O
the O
platform O
, O
a O
young O
soldier B-TER
was O
nearby O
. O

I O
felt O
no O
pain O
, O
my O
ankle O
joint O
had O
been O
completely O
smashed O
, O
my O
foot O
was O
only O
a O
shapeless O
mass O
. O

My O
brain O
was O
feverishly O
trying O
to O
work O
out O
how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
and O
with O
it O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
address O
. O

Very O
quietly O
, O
I O
asked O
the O
soldier B-TER
to O
take O
the O
bag O
but O
he O
was O
not O
brave O
enough O
, O
as O
he O
knew O
that O
something O
was O
not O
right O
. O

Behrend B-PER
called O
an O
ambulance B-TER
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Hospital I-TER
in O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
which O
at O
this O
time O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
assembly O
camp O
instead O
of O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
into O
which O
I O
was O
carried O
on O
a O
stretcher O
. O

Behrend B-PER
sat O
next O
to O
the O
stretcher O
on O
the O
journey O
to O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

I O
now O
got O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards B-TER
out O
of O
my O
bag O
and O
with O
Behrend B-PER
watching O
not O
daring O
to O
take O
them O
away O
from O
me O
, O
tore O
them O
up O
into O
the O
tiniest O
pieces O
I O
could O
, O
so O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
put O
them O
together O
again O
and O
scattered O
the O
pieces O
in O
the O
ambulance B-TER
, O
as O
the O
window O
was O
shut O
so O
I O
could O
not O
throw O
them O
out O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
medical I-TER
staff I-TER
who O
were O
interned O
there O
and O
looked O
after O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
waiting O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
. O

Not O
until O
then O
did O
I O
lose O
consciousness O
and O
only O
came O
to O
again O
during O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
doctors B-TER
had O
performed O
an O
operation B-TER
on O
my O
foot O
and O
put O
a O
two O
- O
part O
plaster O
cast O
from O
my O
knee O
to O
my O
upper O
thigh O
, O
as O
my O
foot O
had O
to O
be O
bandaged O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

It O
was O
thoroughly O
decaying O
. O

I O
had O
gangrene B-TER
and O
osteomyelitis B-TER
and O
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
, O
who O
was O
treating O
me O
along O
with O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Helischkowski B-PER
and O
Dr O
Cohen B-PER
, O
bathed O
the O
foot O
each O
day O
, O
removed O
loose B-TER
bone I-TER
splinters I-TER
and O
took O
the O
greatest O
possible O
pains O
to O
help O
me O
. O

I O
lay O
for O
4 O
months O
with O
a O
temperature B-TER
of O
40 O
° O
, O
lost O
40 O
lbs O
and O
only O
after O
the O
third O
blood B-TER
transfusion I-TER
did O
the O
fever B-TER
then O
slowly O
subside O
. O

Usually O
they O
would O
have O
amputated B-TER
my O
foot O
, O
however O
I O
would O
then O
usually O
have O
been O
deported B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
soon O
after O
the O
amputation B-TER
. O

Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
knew O
this O
, O
and O
as O
he O
had O
sympathy O
for O
me O
, O
he O
tried O
to O
save O
me O
and O
he O
managed O
to O
do O
it O
as O
well O
, O
by O
getting O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
Moeller B-PER
( O
this O
latter O
was O
the O
second O
highest O
authority O
after O
Heydrich B-PER
, O
so O
I O
was O
told O
) O
, O
interested O
in O
my O
case O
. O

Moeller B-PER
had O
studied O
medicine B-TER
for O
several O
semesters O
and O
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
turned O
me O
into O
a O
case O
study O
. O

My O
life O
was O
worthless O
in O
any O
case O
, O
so O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
bad O
, O
if O
my O
foot O
had O
cost O
me O
my O
life O
. O

So O
to O
satisfy O
the O
interest O
of O
Herr B-TER
Moeller B-PER
I O
was O
and O
remained O
under O
arrest B-TER
behind O
barbed O
wire O
in O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
confined O
to O
bed O
, O
my O
foot O
up O
in O
a O
sling O
for O
months O
, O
in O
the O
most O
terrible O
pain O
. O

At O
night O
the O
supervisory O
staff O
would O
come O
through O
the O
ward O
, O
shine O
a O
light O
into O
the O
beds O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
was O
still O
there O
, O
and O
people B-TER
were O
constantly O
being O
deported B-TER
, O
even O
on O
stretchers O
, O
so O
that O
I O
had O
screaming O
fits O
for O
fear B-TER
of O
also O
being O
transported B-TER
in O
this O
condition O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
was O
the O
only O
full O
Jew O
who O
stayed O
there O
under O
arrest B-TER
for O
such O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
terrible O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
and O
, O
after O
the O
first O
four O
months O
when O
I O
began O
slowly O
to O
start O
eating B-TER
again O
, O
terrible O
hunger B-TER
. O

Each O
morning O
two O
dry O
slices O
of O
bread B-TER
with O
jam B-TER
, O
each O
evening O
the O
same O
and O
at O
midday O
soup B-TER
made O
from O
water B-TER
used O
to O
boil O
swede B-TER
or O
kohlrabi B-TER
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
already O
sick O
just O
at O
the O
smell O
of O
it O
. O

During O
the O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
we O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
cellar O
. O

At O
times O
I O
got O
yet O
another O
high O
fever B-TER
, O
then O
the O
plaster O
splints O
would O
be O
scaled O
down O
and O
the O
Jewish B-TER
nurse I-TER
would O
lift O
me O
into O
a O
wicker O
chair O
in O
which O
I O
was O
hardly O
able O
to O
sit O
, O
I O
had O
lost O
so O
much O
weight O
and O
had O
become O
so O
weak O
. O

In O
the O
hospital B-TER
there O
were O
also O
so O
- O
called O
free O
patients O
, O
that O
is O
, O
those O
of O
mixed B-TER
race I-TER
, O
who O
were O
still O
protected O
by O
that O
part O
of O
their O
parentage O
that O
was O
Christian B-TER
. O

where O
they O
lived O
. O

In O
this O
way O
April O
1945 O
arrived O
. O

The O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
came O
so O
frequently O
, O
that O
with O
several O
other O
patients O
I O
had O
to O
spend O
weeks O
in O
the O
dark O
hospital B-TER
cellar O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
move O
in O
the O
wheelchair O
and O
everything O
had O
to O
be O
done O
in O
it O
, O
in O
the O
dark O
without O
help O
from O
the O
nurse B-TER
. O

When O
the O
bombing B-TER
and O
the O
fighting B-TER
began O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
I O
contracted O
erysipelas B-TER
and O
my O
temperature B-TER
went O
up O
to O
40 O
° O
, O
but O
at O
least O
they O
managed O
to O
set O
up O
a O
bed O
for O
me O
in O
the O
cellar O
, O
in O
which O
I O
lay O
until O
liberation B-TER
on O
8th O
May O
1945 O
. O

I O
was O
a O
skeleton O
, O
weighed O
62 O
lbs O
, O
or O
31 O
kilos O
. O

One O
day O
during O
the O
bombing B-TER
it O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
everyone O
in O
the O
part O
of O
the O
cellar O
where O
I O
was O
lying O
ran O
away O
into O
another O
part O
of O
the O
cellar O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
there O
all O
alone O
, O
confined O
to O
bed O
, O
unable O
to O
move O
. O

Luckily O
nothing O
happened O
to O
me O
there O
, O
but O
the O
feeling O
of O
helplessness O
is O
indescribable O
. O

Foreign B-TER
Jews O
, O
among O
others O
Russian B-LOC
Jews O
, O
had O
also O
been O
interned O
there O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
; O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
went O
with O
a O
certain O
Herr B-TER
Gordon B-PER
to O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Kommandant O
there O
and O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
him O
who O
we O
were O
and O
asked O
for O
protection O
and O
help B-TER
. O

The O
Russians B-LOC
said O
that O
anyone O
who O
knew O
how O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
lived O
in O
Russia B-LOC
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
believe O
that O
there O
was O
single O
Jew O
still O
alive O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
convinced O
them O
of O
this O
, O
and O
we O
got O
shelter B-TER
and O
help B-TER
as O
well O
as O
food B-TER
. O

Only O
on O
30th O
June O
1945 O
was O
I O
able O
to O
leave O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
still O
today O
have O
to O
receive O
frequent O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
, O
as O
my O
foot O
started O
to O
knit O
together O
only O
very O
slowly O
and O
opens O
up O
now O
and O
then O
and O
sometimes O
discharges B-TER
bone I-TER
fragments I-TER
. O

My O
mental O
state O
has O
also O
suffered O
badly O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
, O
I O
passed O
my O
master O
craftsman O
’s O
diploma B-TER
as O
a O
dressmaker B-TER
and O
am O
now O
independent O
, O
and O
I O
work B-TER
as O
much O
as O
my O
strength O
allows O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
for O
me O
, O
with O
the O
use O
of O
elaborate O
orthopaedic O
shoes B-TER
, O
with O
some O
effort O
, O
despite O
having O
no O
heel O
, O
just O
walking O
on O
the O
bone O
, O
and O
with O
diminished O
mobility O
in O
my O
ankle O
joint O
, O
in O
some O
measure O
to O
walk O
by O
myself O
. O

I O
enclose O
a O
photocopy O
of O
the O
permit O
for O
my O
release B-TER
from O
custody B-TER
dated O
29th O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
probably O
thought O
that O
in O
this O
way O
, O
by O
releasing B-TER
us O
from O
custody B-TER
shortly O
before O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
marched O
in O
, O
they O
would O
buy O
their O
freedom O
or O
at O
least O
mitigate O
the O
just O
punishment O
that O
was O
waiting O
for O
them O
. O

( O
All O
detainees B-TER
received O
this O
permit O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
those O
who O
were O
in O
a O
position O
to O
leave O
the O
building O
of O
course O
did O
so O
; O
I O
myself O
was O
far O
too O
ill B-TER
and O
helpless O
to O
leave O
) O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
a O
close O
friend O
who O
my O
mother O
had O
known O
for O
30 O
years O
. O

This O
lady B-TER
, O
a O
Christian B-TER
, O
had O
known O
me O
from O
the O
day O
I O
was O
born O
, O
she O
had O
met O
my O
mother O
many O
years O
before O
. O

As O
my O
parents O
trusted O
her O
completely O
, O
they O
gave O
her O
various O
items O
for O
safekeeping O
, O
among O
other O
things O
money B-TER
, O
and O
as O
we O
had O
had O
to O
surrender O
our O
gold O
and O
silver O
, O
a O
gold O
ring O
that O
she O
had O
once O
given O
to O
me O
. O

As O
she O
had O
been O
bombed B-TER
out I-TER
herself O
, O
everything O
but O
the O
money B-TER
and O
the O
ring O
had O
been O
lost O
. O

I O
visited O
her O
several O
times O
while O
I O
was O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
did O
some O
sewing O
for O
her O
. O

After O
I O
was O
with O
the O
Dänes B-PER
and O
she O
had O
already O
been O
bombed B-TER
out I-TER
I O
asked O
her O
to O
give O
the O
ring O
back O
to O
me O
, O
as O
she O
, O
living O
in O
the O
city O
, O
was O
at O
much O
greater O
risk O
of O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
than O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
, O
consequently O
everything O
would O
have O
been O
much O
safer O
in O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
. O

Her O
reply O
was O
, O
I O
’ve O
already O
given O
the O
ring O
to O
somebody O
else O
some O
time O
ago O
! O
I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
had O
been O
slapped O
on O
the O
face O
; O
by O
this O
she O
had O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
in O
her O
judgement O
I O
would O
not O
survive B-TER
, O
so O
would O
never O
wear O
the O
ring O
again O
. O

Even O
the O
money B-TER
I O
could O
only O
get O
from O
her O
with O
difficulty O
in O
instalments O
. O

She O
never O
asked O
what O
I O
was O
living O
off O
at O
that O
time O
. O

She O
should O
have O
offered O
me O
my O
parents O
’ O
money B-TER
herself O
, O
especially O
as O
she O
knew O
the O
plight O
I O
was O
in O
, O
without O
a O
penny O
piece O
from O
home B-TER
, O
with O
only O
the O
compassion O
and O
mercy O
of O
strangers O
to O
rely O
on O
. O

Before O
the O
war B-TER
, O
I O
lived O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
two O
children B-TER
in O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC
. O

My O
husband O
was O
a O
Bank B-TER
Manager O
and O
I O
, O
myself O
, O
studied B-TER
to O
be O
a O
tailor O
in O
my O
youth O
and O
had O
a O
fashion O
salon O
, O
which O
went O
very O
well O
. O

In O
my O
youth O
, O
I O
insisted O
on O
learning B-TER
a O
trade B-TER
and O
studied B-TER
to O
be O
a O
tailor O
. O

I O
was O
actually O
a O
fervent O
Zionist B-TER
and O
wanted O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Israel B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
do O
this O
, O
I O
needed O
a O
practical O
trade B-TER
. O

My O
parents O
, O
however O
, O
were O
very O
much O
against O
it O
. O

They O
were O
not O
Zionists B-TER
. O

They O
were O
also O
not O
overly O
pious O
Jews O
, O
but O
were O
what O
I O
would O
describe O
as O
good O
Jews O
. O

I O
, O
thus O
, O
visited O
a O
technical B-TER
college I-TER
and O
learned O
everything O
about O
tailoring O
and O
I O
was O
also O
a O
teacher O
for O
a O
few O
years O
at O
the O
same O
college B-TER
- O
This O
latter O
profession O
would O
prove O
very O
beneficial O
to O
me O
during O
the O
occupation B-TER
. O

A O
day O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
, O
we O
left O
Krakow B-LOC
to O
resettle O
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
, O
where O
my O
parents O
lived O
. O

I O
remained O
there O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

During O
the O
first O
two O
years O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
Lemberg B-LOC
formed O
part O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
zone O
of O
occupation B-TER
… O
that O
means O
: O
occupied B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

Nothing O
happened O
to O
us O
during O
this O
time O
and O
I O
may O
say O
explicitly O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
behaviour O
was O
beyond O
reproach O
. O

We O
could O
pursue O
our O
trades B-TER
. O

My O
husband O
worked B-TER
once O
a O
week O
at O
a O
bank B-TER
and O
I O
as O
a O
Tailor O
. O

Our O
children B-TER
, O
a O
daughter B-TER
of O
nine O
years O
and O
a O
son B-TER
of O
five O
attended O
school B-TER
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
even O
though O
a O
war B-TER
was O
on O
, O
that O
we O
were O
occupied B-TER
by O
a O
foreign B-TER
army I-TER
and O
that O
we O
considered O
the O
Russians B-LOC
invaders O
and O
did O
not O
love O
our O
enemy O
… O
, O
nothing O
disturbed O
our O
existence O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
many O
Polish B-LOC
Jews O
were O
kidnapped B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

These O
were O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
decided O
to O
cross O
the O
border O
into O
the O
German B-LOC
zone O
or O
had O
attempted O
to O
do O
so O
illegally B-TER
. O

They O
were O
classified O
as O
unreliable O
and O
transported B-TER
to O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

As O
we O
were O
not O
of O
such O
a O
mind O
to O
emigrate B-TER
from O
the O
Russian B-LOC
occupied B-TER
zone O
into O
the O
German B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
left O
alone O
. O

We O
were O
given O
Russian B-LOC
passports B-TER
and O
nothing O
more O
. O

When O
I O
now O
think O
about O
it O
, O
what O
we O
later O
experienced O
and O
suffered O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
it O
was O
not O
clear O
to O
us O
at O
the O
time O
that O
relatively O
the O
Russians B-LOC
behaved O
like O
angels O
. O

In O
June O
1941 O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
came O
and O
the O
persecution B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
began O
immediately O
. O

This O
would O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
had O
the O
Ukranian B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
populations O
not O
gone O
along O
with O
it O
. O

Had O
they O
not O
done O
this O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
first O
of O
all O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
find O
out O
who O
was O
a O
Jew O
and O
where O
they O
lived O
. O

The O
Ukranians B-LOC
and O
Poles B-LOC
knew O
this O
and O
immediately O
informed O
the O
German B-LOC
occupiers B-TER
, O
so O
that O
no O
- O
one O
needed O
to O
wait O
for O
murder B-TER
and O
persecution B-TER
. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
invasion B-TER
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
ordered O
into O
so O
- O
called O
labour B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
where O
the O
distribution O
of O
so O
- O
called O
work O
began O
. O

To O
this O
, O
belonged O
, O
for O
example O
, O
cleaning O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
for O
women B-TER
. O

Mothers B-TER
’ O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
take O
their O
daughters B-TER
to O
this O
work B-TER
, O
and O
fathers B-TER
’ O
, O
their O
sons B-TER
. O

My O
husband O
registered B-TER
himself O
as O
a O
carpenter O
as O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
it O
was O
assumed O
amongst O
the O
Jews O
, O
that O
Jews O
with O
practical O
trades B-TER
would O
not O
be O
deported B-TER
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
took O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
my O
husband O
our O
small O
son O
to O
work B-TER
. O

The O
work B-TER
never O
went O
by O
without O
beatings B-TER
and I-TER
brutality I-TER
. O

We O
received O
no O
pay B-TER
and O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

In O
order O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
alive O
, O
we O
furtively O
sold O
jewellery O
and O
other O
items O
belonging O
to O
our O
parents O
. O

This O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
strictly O
forbidden O
, O
but O
gentile O
Poles B-LOC
risked O
punishment B-TER
, O
because O
they O
could O
buy O
the O
most O
beautiful O
objects O
for O
a O
song O
in O
this O
way O
. O

With O
this O
money B-TER
, O
we O
bought O
black B-TER
market I-TER
food B-TER
. O

Even O
this O
was O
, O
naturally O
, O
forbidden O
. O

In O
spring O
1942 O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
resettlements B-TER
began O
and O
nobody O
knew O
that O
it O
concerned O
evacuation B-TER
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
of O
Belzec B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
15 O
- O
20,000 O
Jews O
with O
children B-TER
went O
there O
. O

Even O
I O
was O
trapped O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
children B-TER
in O
the O
school B-TER
which O
served O
as O
a O
detention B-TER
centre O
and O
we O
waited O
for O
deportation B-TER
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
a O
coincidence O
that O
was O
never O
really O
explained O
, O
we O
were O
brought O
out O
of O
the O
school B-TER
by O
the O
Council O
of O
Jewish O
Elders O
and O
sent O
back O
to O
our O
already O
cordoned O
- O
off O
apartment B-TER
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

We O
had O
spent O
a O
day O
and O
a O
night O
in O
the O
detention B-TER
centre O
. O

Our O
parents O
, O
who O
lived O
in O
another O
part O
of O
Lemberg B-LOC
were O
, O
at O
this O
time O
, O
left O
alone O
. O

We O
decided O
from O
now O
on O
not O
to O
let O
our O
children B-TER
onto O
the O
streets O
alone O
. O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
the O
first O
large O
- O
scale O
operation O
took O
place O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
put O
a O
special O
stamp O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
permit I-TER
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
, O
those O
who O
had O
a O
stamp O
on O
their O
card B-TER
, O
would O
not O
be O
resettled O
. O

My O
husband O
had O
such O
a O
stamp O
and O
felt O
very O
secure O
because O
of O
it O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
such O
a O
stamp O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
take O
the O
children B-TER
and O
I O
would O
seek O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
killings B-TER
and O
people B-TER
spoke O
constantly O
of O
resettlement O
. O

Continuously O
during O
the O
day O
and O
particularly O
at O
night O
, O
trains B-TER
departed O
with O
Jews O
… O
, O
since O
that O
time O
, O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
the O
sound O
of O
trains B-TER
. O

We O
then O
later O
found O
out O
that O
some O
of O
the O
transports B-TER
went O
directly O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

Only O
the O
younger O
people O
were O
initially O
deported B-TER
to O
the O
various O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
slowly O
killed B-TER
. O

We O
looked O
for O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
for O
me O
and O
found O
one O
in O
the O
house B-TER
next O
door O
. O

There O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
had O
a O
hat O
shop O
, O
which O
had O
, O
naturally O
, O
long O
since O
stopped O
trading B-TER
and O
within O
this O
closed O
shop O
the O
owner O
lived O
with O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
niece O
. O

I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
this O
shop O
. O

We O
could O
not O
think O
of O
a O
better O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

The O
owner O
did O
not O
want O
me O
to O
bring O
my O
children B-TER
with O
me O
and O
, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
anything O
would O
happen O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
children B-TER
, O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
I O
would O
move O
into O
the O
shop O
and O
that O
, O
each O
morning O
before O
going O
to O
work B-TER
, O
my O
husband O
would O
give O
my O
food B-TER
to O
my O
daughter B-TER
in O
the O
shop O
on O
my O
behalf O
. O

He O
would O
then O
collect O
her O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
at O
the O
keyhole O
of O
the O
locked O
shop O
door O
and O
observed O
what O
went O
on O
in O
the O
street O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
my O
husband O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
morning O
with O
our O
son B-TER
, O
and O
saw O
them O
return O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
also O
saw O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
leading O
away O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

On O
the O
afternoon O
of O
the O
5th O
of O
August O
, O
it O
was O
the O
fifth O
day O
of O
the O
operation O
, O
one O
of O
the O
womens B-TER
’ O
brothers O
came O
, O
who O
had O
hidden B-TER
me O
and O
said O
It O
’s O
terrible O
today O
! O
Today O
, O
they O
’re O
taking O
the O
children O
! O
I O
got O
a O
terrible O
shock O
and O
begged O
her O
brother O
to O
get O
a O
message O
to O
my O
husband O
from O
me O
that O
he O
should O
hide B-TER
our O
children B-TER
, O
but O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
! O
From O
the O
keyhole O
, O
I O
could O
only O
see O
what O
happened O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house B-TER
. O

And O
, O
upon O
hearing O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
seeing O
them O
pass O
by O
, O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
they O
had O
gone O
into O
the O
house B-TER
next O
- O
door O
. O

We O
could O
hear O
how O
a O
member O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
asked O
the O
Landlady O
for O
the O
key O
to O
the O
shop O
. O

The O
landlady O
did O
not O
have O
the O
key O
, O
but O
a O
neighbour O
said O
that O
she O
had O
one O
and O
went O
to O
get O
it O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
put O
it O
into O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
leading O
to O
our O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
but O
the O
lock O
did O
not O
work B-TER
properly O
. O

We O
all O
stood O
paralysed O
with O
fear B-TER
. O

He O
shook O
the O
door O
and O
pulled O
the O
bell O
cord O
up O
and O
down O
, O
but O
the O
door O
did O
not O
open O
. O

One O
kick O
with O
his O
boot B-TER
would O
have O
sufficed O
to O
kick O
it O
in O
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
turned O
around O
and O
left O
without O
having O
opened O
the O
door O
. O

We O
were O
all O
still O
as O
if O
possessed O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
little B-TER
girl I-TER
say O
loudly O
to O
the O
Landlady O
outside O
the O
house B-TER
next O
- O
door O
They O
took O
Herr O
Stern O
and O
little O
Uri O
from O
our O
house O
! O
And O
, O
as O
the O
landlady O
was O
hard O
of O
hearing O
, O
she O
repeated O
the O
sentence O
once O
more O
even O
louder O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
learnt O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
my O
husband O
and O
child B-TER
. O

I O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
again O
. O

When O
it O
was O
dark O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
onto O
the O
street O
to O
look O
for O
them O
. O

The O
Jewish O
shopkeeper O
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
niece O
fainted O
after O
the O
affair O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
are O
now O
all O
dead B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
14 O
days O
wandering O
the O
streets O
at O
the O
time O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
anything O
I O
could O
, O
but O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
. O

My O
parents O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

They O
were O
, O
along O
with O
120 O
others O
, O
in O
hiding B-TER
in O
an O
attic O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
killed B-TER
40,000 O
Jews O
. O

Later O
, O
a O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
opened O
. O

All O
Jews O
had O
to O
go O
there O
voluntarily O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
small O
and O
cramped O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
lived O
8 O
people B-TER
to O
a O
formerly O
very O
small O
commercial B-TER
premises I-TER
. O

I O
had O
my O
parents O
with O
me O
there O
, O
who O
only O
there O
learned O
of O
the O
disappearance O
of O
my O
husband O
and O
son B-TER
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
live O
inside O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
work B-TER
outside O
it O
. O

About O
six O
weeks O
after O
the O
operation O
I O
found O
work B-TER
as O
a O
tailor O
for O
two O
secretaries O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
. O

The O
first O
secretary O
was O
called O
Irmgard B-PER
Wieth I-PER
. O

She O
was O
about O
30 O
years O
old O
and O
came O
from O
Strasbourg B-LOC
where O
her O
father O
was O
a O
teacher B-TER
at O
the O
grammar B-TER
school I-TER
. O

She O
was O
very O
enthusiastic O
to O
have O
found O
a O
good O
tailor O
and O
spoke O
to O
me O
often O
. O

She O
also O
enquired O
as O
to O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
child B-TER
, O
whereupon O
she O
said O
Why O
did O
you O
not O
hide O
the O
child O
? O
At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
said O
to O
myself O
that O
she O
had O
to O
be O
a O
kind O
- O
hearted O
person O
, O
who O
sympathised O
and O
thought O
that O
I O
would O
possibly O
turn O
to O
her O
in O
an O
emergency O
. O

Like O
all O
German B-LOC
civil B-TER
servants I-TER
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
very O
good O
at O
general O
management O
. O

She O
lived O
in O
a O
very O
nice O
one B-TER
- I-TER
bedroom I-TER
apartment I-TER
with O
a O
kitchen B-TER
and O
bath B-TER
. O

She O
was O
supplied O
with O
considerable O
quantities O
of O
food B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
in O
particular O
. O

These O
were O
clothes B-TER
which O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
Jews O
. O

It O
was O
these O
clothes B-TER
which O
I O
had O
to O
alter O
for O
her O
. O

In O
November O
1942 O
, O
a O
second O
operation O
began O
. O

In O
the O
very O
first O
night O
, O
I O
coincidentally O
did O
not O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
but O
my O
parents O
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
were O
there O
. O

I O
had O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
working B-TER
at O
a O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
’s I-TER
. O

It O
was O
late O
and O
I O
said O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

She O
said O
that O
I O
had O
better O
stay O
the O
night O
there O
. O

Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
on O
the O
streets O
at O
night O
, O
so O
I O
stayed O
. O

Very O
early O
, O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
, O
my O
daughter B-TER
came O
. O

She O
had O
run B-TER
away I-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
took O
my O
daughter B-TER
to O
work B-TER
with O
me O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
. O

During O
the O
night O
and O
the O
following O
day O
, O
many O
Jews O
were O
arrested B-TER
, O
who O
were O
not O
employed B-TER
in O
the O
Wehrmacht O
and O
, O
as O
I O
turned O
up O
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
I O
was O
told O
We O
are O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
employ O
you O
! O
Most O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
did O
not O
go O
, O
only O
a O
very O
few O
, O
who O
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
like O
me O
, O
went O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
that O
morning O
. O

I O
was O
totally O
helpless O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
clear O
to O
me O
, O
if O
I O
returned O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
now O
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
, O
we O
would O
be O
killed B-TER
. O

And O
, O
as O
I O
saw O
no O
other O
way O
out O
, O
I O
crept O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
asked O
her O
if O
I O
could O
not O
, O
at O
least O
, O
give O
her O
my O
daughter B-TER
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Her O
first O
reaction O
was O
great O
surprise O
. O

How O
can O
I O
do O
that O
? O
She O
asked O
me O
. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
alone O
in O
your O
apartment O
! O
I O
said O
that O
I O
knew O
why O
she O
hesitated O
; O
she O
was O
uncertain O
, O
as O
only O
Germans B-LOC
lived O
in O
the O
block O
. O

Finally O
, O
she O
explained O
that O
she O
would O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
day O
, O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
corridor O
of O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
waited O
. O

Some O
Jews O
were O
needed O
for O
black B-TER
market I-TER
work B-TER
. O

Now O
and O
again O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
appeared O
in O
order O
to O
see O
if O
I O
was O
still O
there O
. O

The O
other O
Jews O
, O
who O
were O
sitting O
there O
, O
asked O
me O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
do O
. O

I O
was O
scared O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

I O
could O
not O
say O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

Somehow O
, O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
would O
help O
me O
in O
the O
end O
, O
but O
nobody O
should O
know O
this O
. O

Around O
about O
evening O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
appeared O
again O
in O
the O
corridor O
and O
collected O
me O
. O

I O
must O
speak O
with O
my O
colleague O
she O
said O
. O

Please O
wait O
! O
The O
colleague O
, O
the O
second O
secretary O
, O
with O
whom O
she O
was O
close O
friends O
, O
and O
for O
whom O
I O
had O
also O
altered O
clothes B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
a O
male O
supervisor O
. O

After O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
, O
she O
appeared O
once O
more O
and O
said O
to O
me O
It O
’s O
OK O
! O
Take O
your O
armband B-TER
off O
( O
with O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
) O
and O
throw O
it O
away O
. O

Then O
, O
walk O
slowly O
and O
calmly O
along O
the O
street O
towards O
the O
tram O
stop O
. O

My O
friend O
and O
the O
Town O
Councillor O
will O
go O
before O
you O
and O
I O
will O
follow O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
manner O
that O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
whole O
town O
and O
were O
brought O
into O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

She O
only O
had O
potatoes B-TER
to O
eat B-TER
in O
her O
apartment B-TER
, O
as O
she O
almost O
always O
ate B-TER
in O
the O
canteen B-TER
at O
work B-TER
. O

This O
was O
all O
the O
same O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
potatoes B-TER
. O

I O
stayed O
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
for O
two O
weeks O
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
. O

I O
made O
enquiries O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
operation O
was O
over O
yet O
. O

I O
was O
very O
fearful B-TER
for O
my O
parents O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
they O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

It O
was O
only O
after O
two O
weeks O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
let O
me O
go O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
find O
my O
parents O
. O

They O
were O
both O
alive O
, O
but O
they O
both O
believed O
that O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
were O
no O
longer O
alive O
. O

I O
returned O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
apartment B-TER
and O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
I O
absolutely O
had O
to O
return O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

I O
could O
not O
leave O
my O
parents O
alone O
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
new O
armbands B-TER
had O
been O
distributed O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
with O
the O
insignia O
of O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
knew O
a O
Jewish B-TER
Doctor I-TER
and O
she O
asked O
where O
she O
could O
get O
an O
armband B-TER
for O
me O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
Doctor I-TER
was O
very O
surprised O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
kept O
a O
Jew O
in O
hiding B-TER
and O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
take O
a O
relative O
of O
his O
. O

He O
offered O
her O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money B-TER
for O
this O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
came O
and O
told O
us O
that O
she O
was O
utterly O
disgusted O
. O

I O
’m O
not O
doing O
it O
for O
money O
! O
she O
explained O
. O

If O
I O
have O
you O
and O
your O
child O
at O
my O
home O
, O
I O
have O
a O
clear O
conscience O
… O
, O
but O
for O
money O
? O
No O
way O
! O
Again O
and O
again O
she O
protested O
when O
I O
told O
her O
I O
must O
return O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
my O
parents O
. O

Alright O
! O
she O
said O
one O
day O
. O

Go O
, O
if O
you O
have O
to O
! O
But O
Lilith O
( O
that O
was O
my O
daughter O
) O
is O
staying O
with O
me O
! O
That O
’s O
a O
shame O
for O
the O
Gestapo O
. O

They O
’ll O
shoot O
you O
one O
day O
and O
then O
I O
’ll O
adopt O
Lilith O
! O
I O
then O
got O
my O
new O
armband B-TER
with O
her O
help O
, O
went O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
remained O
with O
her O
. O

Despite O
the O
armband B-TER
, O
my O
position O
was O
very O
complicated O
. O

Possession O
of O
an O
armband B-TER
ought O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
wearer O
had O
work B-TER
with O
the O
Wehrmacht O
, O
but O
I O
had O
no O
such O
work B-TER
. O

I O
had O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
acquire O
it O
illegally O
. O

This O
, O
I O
did O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
some O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
Director O
of O
this O
factory B-TER
was O
very O
understanding O
towards O
Jews O
and O
was O
very O
good O
to O
them O
. O

I O
was O
even O
allowed O
to O
take O
my O
father O
into O
the O
factory B-TER
with O
me O
. O

Had O
I O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
this O
, O
he O
would O
have O
been O
killed B-TER
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
was O
63 O
years O
old O
; O
I O
said O
he O
was O
55 O
and O
therefore O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
work B-TER
with O
me O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Every O
morning O
, O
we O
always O
left O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
with O
a O
group O
of O
35 O
Jews O
, O
in O
order O
to O
go O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
groups O
, O
who O
went O
to O
work B-TER
, O
were O
always O
led O
by O
a O
band B-TER
of O
musicians B-TER
composed O
of O
Jews O
, O
who O
had O
to O
play O
pleasing O
melodies B-TER
. O

It O
was O
always O
the O
same O
torment O
for O
me O
each O
morning O
and O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
I O
was O
losing O
ever O
more O
nerves O
each O
morning O
. O

But O
, O
this O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Nazis O
. O

They O
were O
quite O
systematically O
driving O
us O
all O
mad O
! O
They O
wanted O
to O
ruin B-TER
our I-TER
nerves I-TER
. O

From O
the O
groups O
of O
those O
going O
to O
work B-TER
, O
there O
were O
, O
daily O
, O
hundreds O
brought O
out O
and O
murdered B-TER
. O

You O
never O
knew O
, O
when O
leaving O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
whether O
you O
would O
return O
alive O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
countless O
Jews O
disappeared O
into O
nothingness O
. O

In O
March O
1943 O
, O
they O
took O
my O
father O
from O
me O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
again O
. O

Every O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
I O
furtively O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
were O
working B-TER
during O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
darkness O
of O
the O
street O
, O
I O
discreetly O
took O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
crept O
away O
through O
the O
whole O
town O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

Then O
, O
during O
the O
following O
Sunday O
, O
I O
altered O
her O
clothes B-TER
, O
for O
it O
was O
only O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
could O
thank O
her O
for O
what O
she O
had O
done O
for O
my O
daughter B-TER
. O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
loved O
my O
needlework O
and O
, O
as O
her O
only O
interest O
was O
clothes B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
never O
came O
to O
an O
end O
. O

One O
of O
her O
rooms B-TER
was O
full O
of O
cupboards O
filled O
with O
clothes B-TER
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
spent O
Sundays O
’ O
with O
her O
and O
every O
Monday O
, O
at O
3.30am O
I O
crept O
from O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
, O
through O
the O
town O
and O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
I O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
unobserved O
returning O
from O
working B-TER
through O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
I O
turned O
around O
and O
went O
with O
another O
group O
who O
were O
going O
to O
work B-TER
through O
the O
day O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
outside O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
was O
, O
naturally O
, O
very O
dangerous O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
said O
to O
me O
again O
and O
again O
that O
I O
would O
definitely O
be O
caught O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
one O
day O
. O

The O
streets O
were O
full O
of O
Germans B-LOC
, O
Ukrainians B-LOC
and O
Poles B-LOC
, O
who O
might O
recognise O
me O
. O

Even O
if O
I O
was O
inconspicuous O
, O
anyone O
could O
see O
that O
I O
looked O
very O
rough O
and O
hungry B-TER
, O
as O
all O
Jews O
looked O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
people B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
spent O
every O
weekend O
from O
December O
1942 O
until O
the O
end O
of O
May O
1943 O
without O
anything O
ever O
happening O
to O
me O
. O

On O
the O
31st O
of O
May O
, O
it O
was O
proclaimed O
The O
ghetto O
will O
be O
liquidated O
on O
the O
1st O
of O
June O
. O

All O
Jews O
within O
it O
must O
voluntarily O
report O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
The O
owner O
of O
our O
factory B-TER
tried O
once O
more O
to O
help O
all O
of O
the O
Jews O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
for O
him O
, O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
need O
to O
go O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

He O
negotiated B-TER
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
explained O
that O
our O
35 O
strong O
group O
of O
Jews O
could O
live O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

He O
promised O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
that O
he O
would O
have O
a O
particularly O
good O
leather B-TER
overcoat I-TER
illegally O
finished O
for O
each O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
agreed O
. O

However O
, O
after O
they O
had O
received O
their O
overcoats B-TER
, O
they O
insisted O
that O
the O
Jews O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
factory B-TER
for O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

As O
I O
left O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
in O
order O
to O
resettle B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
my O
mother O
with O
me O
. O

She O
had O
had O
typhus B-TER
and O
pneumonia B-TER
and O
was O
very O
weak O
, O
but O
had O
survived B-TER
both O
. O

I O
, O
thus O
, O
smuggled B-TER
her O
out O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
into O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

And O
now O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
go O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
the O
Director O
was O
ordered O
to O
hasten O
all O
of O
us O
into O
this O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
! O
I O
knew O
that O
if O
I O
hid B-TER
, O
I O
could O
probably O
save O
myself O
by O
getting O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
during O
the O
night O
, O
but O
this O
would O
mean O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
my O
mother O
to O
go O
into O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
alone O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
bring O
myself O
to O
do O
that O
. O

To O
take O
her O
with O
me O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
impossible O
. O

It O
was O
also O
too O
far O
and O
she O
was O
too O
weak O
. O

I O
spoke O
to O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
and O
begged O
him O
to O
help O
us O
in O
any O
way O
he O
could O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
Director O
’s O
office O
during O
this O
conversation O
and O
my O
mother O
was O
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

She O
must O
have O
felt O
what O
was O
going O
on O
inside O
me O
. O

I O
suddenly O
heard O
a O
large O
noise O
and O
disquiet O
in O
the O
square O
. O

Your O
mother O
has O
fallen O
out O
of O
the O
window O
! O
At O
first O
, O
I O
did O
not O
catch O
on O
at O
all O
and O
continued O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
Director O
, O
until O
someone O
came O
up O
to O
me O
again O
and O
called O
me O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
understood O
. O

I O
raced O
down O
the O
staircase O
into O
the O
square O
. O

I O
found O
my O
mother O
in O
a O
sea O
of O
blood B-TER
; O
one O
eye B-TER
was I-TER
missing I-TER
and O
the O
crown O
of O
her O
skull B-TER
was I-TER
broken I-TER
, O
but O
she O
was O
fully O
conscious O
. O

I O
called O
like O
mad O
for O
the O
medics B-TER
. O

I O
had O
totally O
forgotten O
in O
my O
excitement O
that O
Jews O
had O
no B-TER
right I-TER
to O
medical B-TER
assistance I-TER
. O

I O
phoned O
them O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
come O
immediately O
. O

As O
time O
passed O
and O
no O
- O
one O
arrived O
, O
I O
ran O
in O
order O
to O
ask O
why O
no O
- O
one O
was O
coming O
. O

I O
was O
then O
told O
that O
the O
medics B-TER
had O
turned O
up O
, O
but O
had O
left O
again O
upon O
being O
told O
the O
matter O
concerned O
a O
Jew O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Director O
had O
readied O
a O
car O
in O
which O
his O
group O
of O
Jews O
would O
be O
conveyed O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Upon O
my O
request O
, O
he O
had O
a O
stretcher O
brought O
upon O
which O
my O
mother O
was O
laid O
. O

The O
Director O
then O
ordered O
that O
we O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
... O
, O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
hospital B-TER
and O
be O
dropped O
off O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
remaining O
passengers O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
event O
saved O
my O
life O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
to O
be O
burned B-TER
down I-TER
the O
following O
day O
and O
I O
knew O
that O
my O
mother O
, O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
had O
an O
even O
greater O
fear B-TER
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
hospital B-TER
, O
as O
it O
was O
very O
brutal O
there O
and O
that O
those O
patients O
to O
be O
treated O
, O
who O
could O
not O
be O
saved O
, O
were O
thrown B-TER
out I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
window I-TER
. O

So O
, O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
car O
next O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
still O
fully O
conscious O
, O
and O
yet O
blood B-TER
nevertheless O
streamed O
incessantly O
from O
her O
wounds O
. O

I O
must O
take O
you O
to O
the O
ghettohospital O
! O
I O
said O
to O
her O
. O

Are O
you O
afraid O
? O
To O
which O
she O
replied O
I O
’m O
not O
afraid O
! O
I O
was O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
mother O
had O
attempted B-TER
to I-TER
kill I-TER
herself I-TER
, O
in O
order O
to O
free O
me O
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
free O
to O
go O
to O
my O
child B-TER
and O
try O
to O
save O
us O
both O
. O

Upon O
arriving O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
we O
carried O
my O
mother O
in O
and O
placed O
the O
stretcher O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

All O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
were O
about O
to O
leave O
. O

They O
all O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
was O
crazy O
to O
have O
come O
back O
with O
my O
mother O
. O

Within O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
found O
a O
doctor B-TER
and O
no O
patients O
. O

They O
had O
murdered B-TER
them O
all O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

Some O
attempted O
to O
lift O
my O
mother O
out O
of O
the O
continually O
streaming O
blood B-TER
. O

I O
asked O
the O
Doctor B-TER
to O
help O
her O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
had O
no O
medication B-TER
or O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
asked O
him O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Jews O
ran O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
, O
once O
again O
, O
looked O
in O
the O
room O
where O
my O
mother O
lay O
. O

She O
said O
Go O
with O
God O
! O
I O
am O
now O
with O
God O
! O
I O
shut O
the O
door O
and O
looked O
once O
again O
for O
the O
Doctor B-TER
. O

I O
still O
had O
200 O
Zloty B-TER
which O
I O
had O
hidden O
on O
my O
person O
. O

This O
, O
I O
gave O
to O
him O
. O

Here O
! O
Take O
this O
Doctor O
! O
and O
I O
asked O
him O
one O
last O
time O
to O
give O
my O
mother O
something O
... O
, O
something O
which O
worked O
quickly O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
promised O
! O
Whether O
he O
actually O
did O
it O
... O
, O
I O
’ll O
never O
know O
! O
Then O
, O
I O
ran O
down O
and O
out O
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
and O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
leaving O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
for O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

I O
ran O
like O
an O
automaton O
beside O
them O
. O

I O
ran O
totally O
possessed O
and O
desparately O
. O

I O
did O
not O
think O
for O
a O
minute O
about O
taking O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
to O
try O
to O
get O
to O
my O
child B-TER
. O

Through O
pure O
coincidence O
, O
the O
whole O
time O
I O
ran O
next O
to O
a O
young O
relative O
of O
mine O
... O
, O
a O
cousin O
. O

She O
spoke O
incessantly O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
listen O
at O
all O
and O
ran O
on O
. O

But O
she O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
she O
said O
to O
me O
... O
, O
Go O
away O
! O
You O
must O
go O
to O
your O
child O
! O
Run O
! O
Quickly O
! O
Go O
! O
Again O
, O
I O
did O
not O
react O
and O
my O
cousin O
spoke O
on O
You O
must O
go O
! O
Quickly O
! O
Otherwise O
it O
’s O
too O
late O
! O
I O
can O
not O
explain O
it O
, O
how O
it O
suddenly O
happened O
and O
as O
I O
quite O
suddenly O
had O
the O
impulse O
to O
carefully O
take O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
allow O
it O
to O
disappear O
into O
my O
pocket O
as O
we O
got O
quite O
close O
to O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Just O
as O
automatically O
, O
I O
slipped O
away O
from O
the O
group O
, O
which O
carried O
on O
. O

Poles B-LOC
and O
Ukrainians B-LOC
were O
standing O
at O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
looked O
on O
transfixed O
at O
how O
the O
Jews O
went O
voluntarily O
and O
without O
any O
supervision O
whatsoever O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
to O
their O
deaths B-TER
. O

I O
also O
do O
not O
know O
how O
I O
arrived O
totally O
unharmed O
into O
the O
block O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
earlier O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
taken O
a O
Jewish O
couple O
in O
and O
as O
I O
now O
arrived O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
remain O
, O
four O
people B-TER
were O
there O
, O
who O
she O
was O
hiding B-TER
. O

This O
was O
in O
June O
1943 O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
very O
complicated O
for O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
, O
as O
it O
was O
for O
us O
. O

It O
was O
horrifying O
for O
us O
to O
consider O
what O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
risking O
in O
order O
to O
save O
us O
. O

We O
also O
had O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
burden O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
at O
all O
with O
such O
matters O
, O
so O
I O
disguised O
myself O
as O
a O
country O
peasant O
, O
barefoot O
and O
crept O
out O
of O
the O
house B-TER
to O
get O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

It O
was O
only O
a O
little O
, O
as O
everything O
came O
from O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
, O
as O
we O
had O
no O
other O
food B-TER
. O

Only O
Germans B-LOC
lived O
in O
the O
block O
, O
who O
naturally O
, O
knew O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
worked B-TER
all O
day O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
that O
her O
apartment B-TER
was O
empty O
all O
day O
. O

We O
scarcely O
dare O
not O
appear O
. O

A O
period O
of O
time O
thus O
passed O
, O
during O
which O
we O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
ever O
more O
nervous O
. O

Then O
, O
one O
day O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
suddenly O
received O
a O
telegram O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
from O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
hers O
, O
who O
informed O
her O
that O
he O
had O
two O
weeks O
leave O
and O
was O
coming O
to O
visit O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
totally O
beside O
herself O
and O
explained O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
make O
ourselves O
scarce O
. O

Good O
! O
I O
said O
. O

I O
saw O
her O
terrifying O
fear B-TER
and O
wanted O
, O
initially O
, O
to O
calm O
her O
. O

I O
will O
try O
to O
find O
somewhere O
for O
us O
! O
It O
was O
, O
however O
, O
totally O
impossible O
for O
me O
. O

The O
married O
Jewish O
couple O
, O
the O
husband O
of O
whom O
was O
a O
Pharmacist B-TER
, O
had O
zyankali B-TER
. O

He O
suggested O
that O
we O
share O
the O
poison O
, O
so O
that O
we O
could O
all O
poison O
ourselves O
. O

I O
told O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
that O
she O
should O
not O
worry O
, O
that O
we O
would O
leave O
her O
apartment B-TER
and O
find O
somewhere O
to O
commit O
suicide B-TER
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
protested O
vehemently O
. O

You O
do O
n’t O
know O
where O
to O
go O
! O
Even O
she O
was O
afraid O
. O

We O
gathered O
together O
and O
made O
a O
plan O
. O

The O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
next O
to O
the O
kitchen B-TER
was O
emptied O
and O
, O
from O
now O
on O
, O
we O
always O
locked O
ourselves O
in O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
visitors O
. O

Beforehand O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
, O
where O
nobody O
went O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
during O
the O
visit O
of O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
friend O
from O
Amsterdam B-TER
, O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
would O
be O
locked O
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

His O
wife O
would O
openly O
pose O
as O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
cook O
, O
who O
also O
lived O
with O
her O
and O
I O
would O
pose O
a O
her O
Tailor O
, O
who O
would O
work B-TER
for O
her O
during O
the O
day O
and O
go O
home O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
to O
act O
as O
if O
I O
was O
leaving O
. O

These O
roles O
we O
then O
both O
played O
. O

The O
cook O
lived O
officially O
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
slept O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
her O
friend O
could O
not O
go O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Every O
evening O
I O
would O
loudly O
say O
Adieu O
! O
; O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
would O
accompany O
me O
to O
the O
door O
of O
her O
apartment B-TER
and O
whilst O
she O
opened O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
loudly O
and O
acted O
as O
though O
she O
was O
still O
talking O
to O
me O
, O
I O
crept O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen B-TER
on O
tiptoes O
. O

All O
four O
of O
us O
slept O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
on O
the O
floor O
, O
that O
is O
, O
in O
reality O
we O
did O
not O
sleep O
much O
. O

We O
constantly O
worried O
about O
one O
another O
, O
that O
one O
of O
us O
would O
make O
some O
kind O
of O
suspicious O
noise O
, O
talk O
whilst O
sleeping O
or O
even O
snore O
and O
so O
we O
all O
took O
care O
of O
each O
other O
. O

During O
the O
day O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
always O
went O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
the O
friend O
stayed O
at O
the O
apartment B-TER
. O

He O
continually O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
to O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
sat O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

I O
placed O
a O
large O
table O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
to O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
and O
spread O
my O
sewing O
out O
there O
. O

I O
did O
not O
speak O
much O
and O
when O
I O
did O
speak O
, O
I O
did O
so O
only O
a O
very O
little O
and O
in O
bad O
German B-LOC
. O

I O
always O
acted O
as O
though O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
her O
friend O
said O
. O

He O
talked O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
and O
gave O
us O
long O
lectures O
about O
the O
war B-TER
and O
the O
increasing O
English B-LOC
air B-TER
raids I-TER
. O

Sometimes O
, O
I O
left O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
acted O
as O
though O
I O
had O
something O
to O
do O
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms B-TER
… O
, O
then O
I O
called O
him O
to O
help O
me O
with O
some O
hastily O
made O
- O
up O
chore O
, O
in O
order O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

As O
we O
all O
spoke O
to O
each O
other O
in O
whispers O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
acquainted O
with O
this O
when O
she O
was O
at O
home B-TER
. O

Her O
friend O
picked O
up O
upon O
this O
. O

He O
could O
not O
understand O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
ask O
her O
about O
it O
, O
or O
he O
would O
come O
out O
to O
me O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
to O
ask O
me O
whether O
I O
could O
understand O
why O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
whispered O
so O
strangely O
and O
why O
she O
was O
so O
terribly O
nervous O
. O

I O
always O
said O
I O
could O
not O
understand O
and O
gave O
all O
sorts O
of O
reasons O
in O
my O
broken O
German B-LOC
. O

Two O
weeks O
finally O
came O
to O
an O
end O
and O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Amsterdam B-LOC
and O
we O
were O
all O
alone O
once O
more O
. O

A O
new O
problem O
surfaced O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
on O
holiday B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
to O
her O
mother O
’s O
. O

This O
time O
, O
she O
had O
to O
leave O
us O
all O
alone O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
. O

She O
had O
no O
other O
option O
but O
to O
lock O
us O
in O
for O
the O
whole O
time O
she O
was O
away O
. O

We O
could O
not O
even O
so O
much O
as O
move O
as O
the O
apartment B-TER
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
officially O
empty O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
was O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
sneeze O
; O
we O
were O
n’t O
able O
to O
pull O
the O
chain O
on O
the O
toilet O
… O
, O
but O
, O
this O
time O
, O
everything O
went O
well O
and O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
returned O
from O
holiday B-TER
, O
all O
was O
well O
. O

Yet O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
less O
calm O
and O
ever O
more O
nervous O
. O

We O
did O
what O
we O
could O
to O
calm O
her O
down O
, O
but O
there O
was O
really O
nothing O
we O
could O
do O
as O
we O
were O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
her O
disquiet O
. O

We O
became O
accustomed O
to O
reading O
her O
every O
wish O
from O
her O
eyes O
and O
we O
behaved O
like O
slaves O
to O
serve O
her O
and O
to O
be O
helpful O
to O
her O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
she O
had O
formed O
a O
relationship O
with O
a O
Wehrmacht O
officer B-TER
, O
who O
often O
visited O
her O
. O

He O
would O
always O
stay O
in O
the O
front O
room B-TER
and O
never O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

For O
some O
inexplicable O
reason O
, O
her O
friend O
in O
Amsterdam B-LOC
learned O
of O
her O
friendship O
with O
the O
Wehrmacht O
officer B-TER
and O
he O
, O
thus O
, O
appeared O
one O
day O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
out O
of O
sheer O
jealousy O
without O
announcing O
his O
arrival O
beforehand O
. O

He O
kicked O
up O
such O
a O
fuss O
at O
the O
front O
door O
that O
we O
all O
reeled O
in O
shock O
, O
as O
we O
all O
believed O
it O
was O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

All O
four O
of O
us O
hastily O
disappeared O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
, O
which O
we O
locked O
behind O
us O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
went O
slowly O
to O
the O
door O
in O
order O
to O
give O
us O
time O
to O
disappear O
. O

The O
man B-TER
stormed O
in O
and O
began O
charging O
around O
like O
a O
wild O
animal O
, O
but O
not O
in O
search O
of O
us O
as O
we O
had O
thought O
, O
but O
after O
the O
supposed O
rival O
. O

He O
shook O
the O
kitchen B-TER
door O
and O
even O
looked O
through O
the O
keyhole O
in O
order O
to O
see O
whether O
his O
rival O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
hid O
himself O
there O
, O
but O
did O
not O
see O
us O
. O

He O
posed O
a O
terrible O
sight O
, O
but O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
finally O
succeeded O
in O
calming O
him O
down O
. O

He O
had O
, O
of O
course O
, O
found O
no O
- O
one O
, O
so O
he O
went O
away O
. O

This O
time O
, O
not O
only O
were O
we O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
when O
we O
were O
alone O
once O
more O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
beside O
herself O
. O

It O
became O
ever O
more O
complicated O
for O
us O
to O
calm O
her O
down O
. O

Every O
time O
someone O
knocked O
on O
the O
door O
she O
believed O
it O
was O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
; O
she O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
open O
the O
door O
and O
it O
became O
ever O
more O
difficult O
to O
persuade O
her O
not O
to O
lose O
her O
head O
. O

Her O
friend O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
did O
not O
allow O
any O
peace O
. O

He O
got O
in O
contact O
with O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
friend O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
the O
second O
Secretary O
, O
for O
whom O
I O
had O
sewn O
in O
the O
beginning O
and O
for O
whose O
part O
was O
asked O
for O
advice O
about O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
along O
with O
the O
Town O
Councillor O
, O
whether O
they O
should O
have O
taken O
on O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
and O
then O
, O
finally O
, O
whether O
they O
had O
helped O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
get O
into O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

Both O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
colleague O
and O
her O
friend O
advised O
him O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
accommodated B-TER
my O
child B-TER
and O
I. O
He O
then O
turned O
up O
again O
one O
day O
totally O
surprisingly O
and O
barely O
after O
the O
door O
had O
opened O
, O
beginning O
to O
strike O
out O
and O
growled O
I O
know O
everything O
! O
You O
’ve O
been O
keeping O
a O
Jew O
and O
her O
child O
in O
here O
in O
hiding O
! O
You O
’ll O
leave O
your O
job O
in O
the O
general O
government O
in O
eight O
days O
otherwise O
I O
’ll O
report O
you O
! O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
began O
to O
cry O
and O
eventually O
convinced O
him O
to O
go O
with O
her O
into O
a O
room B-TER
and O
not O
remain O
in O
the O
corridor O
, O
where O
all O
the O
other O
occupants O
could O
hear O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
. O

The O
argument O
then O
continued O
for O
hours O
, O
whilst O
we O
crouched O
down O
with O
fear B-TER
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

He O
, O
then O
, O
eventually O
went O
away O
. O

From O
now O
on O
… O
, O
from O
March O
1944 O
, O
all O
four O
of O
us O
lived O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
then O
received O
orders O
to O
leave O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
dissolved O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
general B-ORG
government I-ORG
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
approaching O
Russians B-LOC
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
to O
travel O
with O
the O
remaining O
civil B-TER
servants I-TER
back O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Now O
, O
for O
all O
four O
of O
us O
, O
it O
became O
essential O
to O
find O
a O
new O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

The O
Jewish O
couple O
, O
who O
were O
hidden B-TER
with O
us O
, O
had O
contacts O
in O
the O
Greek B-TER
- I-TER
Orthodox I-TER
community O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
convent B-TER
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
Szepticki B-PER
, O
who O
had O
already O
kept O
around O
60 O
Jews O
in O
hiding B-TER
with O
him O
or O
in O
other O
convents B-TER
. O

This O
involved O
the O
families B-TER
of O
Rabbis B-TER
’ O
in O
particular O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
knew O
these O
people B-TER
and O
his O
son B-TER
was O
in O
hiding B-TER
there O
. O

He O
and O
his O
wife O
now O
turned O
to O
Szepticki B-PER
asking O
for O
help O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
insisted O
that O
she O
would O
tell O
the O
entire O
truth O
to O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
. O

She O
would O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
him O
that O
they O
were O
hidden B-TER
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
and O
that O
she O
would O
really O
ask O
him O
to O
take O
all O
four O
of O
us O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
she O
asked O
, O
later O
, O
she O
insisted O
. O

I O
knew O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
that O
this O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
. O

In O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
into O
a O
Ukrainian B-LOC
convent B-TER
you O
had O
to O
have O
very O
good O
contacts O
and O
references O
. O

The O
married O
couple O
had O
such O
with O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
and O
with O
other O
diverse O
convents B-TER
, O
who O
were O
subordinate O
to O
them O
. O

They O
not O
only O
had O
references O
, O
but O
also O
documents B-TER
. O

I O
, O
however O
, O
had O
neither O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
, O
I O
told O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
that O
he O
should O
, O
in O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
do O
everything O
possible O
to O
save O
his O
wife O
and O
himself O
. O

I O
did O
not O
believe O
for O
a O
second O
that O
he O
would O
do O
the O
slightest O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
only O
at O
the O
very O
end O
that O
, O
should O
he O
be O
successful O
in O
finding O
shelter B-TER
for O
him O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
to O
put O
in O
a O
word O
for O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
. O

Despite O
his O
contacts O
at O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
the O
couple O
had O
the O
greatest O
difficult O
being O
accepted O
and O
their O
discussions O
went O
back O
and O
forth O
for O
weeks O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
would O
become O
of O
me O
and O
my O
child B-TER
and O
it O
was O
very O
bad O
, O
as O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
, O
initially O
, O
to O
pack O
her O
things O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
just O
thought O
constantly O
how O
lucky O
it O
was O
that O
we O
had O
the O
zyankali B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
a O
miracle O
happened O
! O
The O
couple O
had O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
persuading O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
to O
take O
us O
in O
. O

And O
, O
exactly O
24 O
hours O
before O
they O
had O
to O
leave O
our O
house B-TER
, O
a O
nun B-TER
in O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
where O
the O
woman B-TER
was O
to O
be O
taken O
in O
, O
agreed O
to O
take O
in O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
she O
insisted O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
move O
into O
the O
convent B-TER
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
was O
difficult O
for O
me O
, O
as O
I O
had O
promised O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
I O
would O
remain O
with O
her O
until O
her O
departure O
and O
help O
her O
. O

There O
was O
, O
thus O
, O
no O
option O
for O
me O
other O
than O
to O
take O
my O
child B-TER
to O
the O
convent B-TER
for O
11 O
o’clock O
the O
next O
day O
. O

Once O
there O
, O
I O
explained O
to O
the O
nun B-TER
why O
I O
had O
to O
return O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
then O
returned O
to O
her O
apartment B-TER
. O

I O
helped O
her O
pack O
and O
took O
her O
to O
the O
train B-TER
; O
then O
I O
went O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
as O
well O
. O

I O
could O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not O
speak O
Ukrainian B-LOC
, O
yet O
they O
were O
very O
good O
to O
us O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
went O
into O
an O
orphanage B-TER
annexed O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

And O
, O
again O
, O
I O
was O
lucky O
that O
I O
could O
sew O
. O

I O
was O
immediately O
given O
a O
sewing O
machine O
and O
a O
pile O
of O
sewing O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
sewed O
for O
the O
orphans B-TER
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

We O
were O
fed B-TER
well O
and O
amply O
and O
actually O
began O
to O
recover O
somewhat O
physically O
. O

A O
fairly O
long O
while O
passed O
until O
I O
began O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
nun B-TER
was O
becoming O
rather O
a O
little O
less O
frien O
dly O
with O
me O
than O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Finally O
, O
one O
day O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
said O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
also O
hiding B-TER
in O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
rather O
as O
if O
in O
passing O
, O
the O
nun O
no O
longer O
wants O
you O
here O
, O
because O
you O
wo O
n’t O
be O
baptised O
! O
I O
was O
absolutely O
horrified O
, O
as O
I O
had O
not O
given O
it O
any O
thought O
at O
all O
. O

It O
was O
then O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
those O
supervising O
the O
convent B-TER
always O
expected O
such O
things O
without O
having O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
anything O
but O
that O
which O
could O
be O
described O
as O
a O
pious B-TER
Jew O
, O
I O
stuck O
to O
my O
beliefs O
and O
the O
thought O
of O
baptism B-TER
to O
me O
was O
horrifying O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
for O
many O
nights O
until O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
myself O
baptised B-TER
. O

But O
, O
the O
nun B-TER
’s I-TER
stance O
became O
ever O
more O
unpleasant O
and O
so O
I O
went O
to O
her O
one O
day O
and O
explained O
that O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
baptised B-TER
. O

The O
nun B-TER
immediately O
became O
filled O
with O
interest O
and O
changed O
her O
stance O
in O
an O
instant O
. O

A O
priest B-TER
was O
assigned O
the O
task O
of O
instructing O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I. O
My O
daughter B-TER
was O
immensely O
pleased O
. O

She O
found O
everything O
great O
and O
was O
completely O
happy O
and O
content O
. O

And O
, O
with O
that O
, O
I O
had O
no O
way O
out O
, O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
save O
my O
life O
and O
my O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
life O
. O

One O
night O
, O
I O
dreamt O
of O
my O
father O
. O

In O
my O
dream O
, O
I O
asked O
him O
what O
I O
should O
do O
. O

He O
replied O
very O
calmly O
Just O
do O
it O
! O
It O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
! O
There O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
only O
one O
God O
! O
Afterwards O
, O
it O
was O
much O
easier O
for O
me O
. O

One O
day O
, O
news O
arrived O
from O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

She O
was O
back O
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
and O
wanted O
all O
four O
of O
us O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
. O

The O
nun B-TER
quite O
energetically O
denounced O
the O
idea O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
, O
whom O
she O
did O
not O
like O
very O
much O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
leave O
, O
but O
neither O
my O
daughter B-TER
nor O
I O
could O
go O
. O

So O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

During O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
baptism B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
attend O
mass O
every O
Sunday O
and O
the O
church B-TER
was O
located O
in O
the O
district O
in O
which O
we O
had O
earlier O
lived O
when O
my O
husband O
and O
son B-TER
were O
still O
alive O
. O

I O
was O
always O
afraid O
when O
I O
was O
going O
to O
and O
from O
the O
church B-TER
that O
someone O
would O
recognise O
me O
. O

I O
was O
well O
dressed B-TER
again O
and O
looked O
well O
- O
kept O
and O
nourished B-TER
once O
more O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
recognise O
me O
again O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
, O
who O
previously O
knew O
me O
, O
went O
to O
this O
church B-TER
and O
followed O
me O
from O
the O
service O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

I O
immediately O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
nun B-TER
and O
was O
immediately O
resettled O
into O
the O
orphanage B-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
nun B-TER
explained O
to O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
she O
returned O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
, O
as O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
keep O
her O
at O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
else O
for O
the O
woman B-TER
to O
do O
but O
to O
go O
. O

I O
, O
however O
, O
was O
sent O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
ask O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
for O
the O
key O
to O
her O
apartment B-TER
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
later O
remained O
in O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
and O
, O
after O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
ordered O
back O
to O
Germany B-LOC
, O
quite O
a O
few O
Germans B-LOC
vacated O
this O
block O
and O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-LOC
came O
, O
they O
behaved O
exactly O
as O
they O
had O
in O
the O
beginning O
… O
, O
thoroughly O
correctly O
. O

No O
- O
one O
harassed O
us O
; O
we O
could O
come O
and O
go O
as O
we O
pleased O
. O

This O
time O
, O
we O
really O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
they O
were O
angels O
who O
had O
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

At O
my O
baptism B-TER
, O
I O
was O
given O
the O
name O
Maria O
. O

Sometime O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
send O
my O
daughter B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
through O
an O
international B-TER
aid I-TER
organisation I-TER
. O

I O
then O
gave O
her O
the O
task O
of O
immediately O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
contact O
with O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

I O
had O
the O
address O
of O
her O
parents O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
really O
wanted O
to O
know O
whether O
she O
was O
alive O
and O
how O
she O
was O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
succeeded O
in O
contacting O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

She O
was O
alive O
, O
but O
was O
obviously O
not O
doing O
too O
well O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
England B-LOC
a O
year O
after O
my O
daughter B-TER
, O
I O
tried O
to O
acquire O
food B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
for O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

This O
was O
made O
possible O
with O
the O
help O
of O
an O
American B-LOC
aid B-TER
organisation I-TER
, O
which O
declared O
itself O
in O
the O
case O
. O

We O
began O
to O
become O
interested O
in O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
, O
initially O
, O
began O
one O
day O
to O
visit O
us O
in O
England B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
very O
exciting O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
she O
explained O
that O
she O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
remain O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
the O
same O
American B-LOC
aid B-TER
organisation I-TER
, O

arrived O
in O

after O
an O
uneventful O
18 O

. O

In O
my O

, O
together O
with O

, O
I O
had O
the O
official O

withdrawing O

over O
30 O
years O
of O
hard O
work B-TER
living O
in O

without O

. O

I O
also O
had O
a O
certificate O
from O
the O
Berlin B-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
congregation I-ORG
confirming O
my O
active O
role O
with O
them O
over O
a O
long O
period O
, O
plus O
a O
personal O
letter B-TER
of O
recommendation O
to O
the O
general O
secretary O
of O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
congregation B-TER
from O
our O
director O
Heinrich B-PER
Stahl I-PER
, O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
Berlin B-LOC

. O

I O
heard O
my O
last O
official O
German B-LOC
words O
at O
the O
border O
crossing O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
customs O
officer B-TER
who O
glared O
at O
me O
martially O
. O

Having O
inspected O
my O
passport B-TER
he O
asked O
with O
a O
snarl O
: O
You O
’re O
Jewish O
? O
I O
agreed O
and O
added O
: O
I O
’m O
emigrating O
. O

Huh O
, O
and O
about O
time O
too O
, O
he O
answered O
. O

Those O
were O
the O
last O
German B-LOC
words O
which O
set O
me O
on O
my O
way O
. O

In O
the O
first O
days O
of O
my O
stay O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
as O
I O
wandered O
the O
streets O
I O
was O
struck O
initially O
by O
the O
great O
difference O
between O
the O
everyday O
life O
of O
Germany B-LOC
at O
war B-TER
and O
that O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
which O
was O
still O
neutral B-TER
. O

In O
Germany B-LOC
there O
was O
already O
food B-TER
rationing I-TER
, O
with O
shortages O
in O
the O
shops O
and O
restrictions B-TER
, O
while O
here O
everything O
was O
still O
available O
and O
plentiful O
. O

Shop O
windows O
everywhere O
were O
full O
to O
bursting O
and O
there O
was O
no O
trace O
of O
shortage O
. O

But O
I O
soon O
discovered O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
, O
through O
conversations O
with O
relatives O
and O
friends O
as O
well O
by O
personal O
experience O
. O

Everything O
had O
got O
a O
lot O
dearer O
, O
prices O
were O
wildly O
disproportionate O
to O
wages O
. O

Many O
economic B-TER
sectors O
were O
in O
decline O
, O
state O
unemployment O
benefit O
did O
not O
exist O
, O
broad O
sections O
of O
the O
population O
were O
living O
in O
great O
misery B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
were O
hardest O
hit O
. O

Following O
the O
absorption O
of O
Austria B-LOC
into O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
in O
March O
1938 O
, O
Hungary B-LOC
had O
become O
directly O
adjacent O
to O
Nazi B-TER
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
could O
no O
longer O
evade O
the O
growing O
influence O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

It O
enacted O
a O
rapid O
succession O
of O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish B-TER
Laws I-TER
, O
which O
in O
the O
economic B-TER
sphere O
gravely O
damaged O
Jewish O
interests O
. O

The O
proportion B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
individual O
trades O
was O
limited O
to O
a O
fixed O
percentage O
. O

Where O
the O
proportion B-TER
of I-TER
Jewish I-TER
employees O
exceeded O
this O
percentage O
, O
there O
had O
to O
be O
dismissals B-TER
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
total O
of O
wages O
paid O
to O
Jews O
could O
not O
exceed O
this O
percentage O
. O

Public O
contracts O
were O
no O
longer O
awarded O
to O
Jewish O
firms B-TER
. O

Jews O
could O
no O
longer O
work B-TER
in O
state O
monopoly O
sectors O
, O
for O
example O
the O
tobacco O
trade O
. O

The O
number O
of O
Jewish O
doctors B-TER
and O
lawyers B-TER
was O
drastically O
reduced O
, O
other O
free O
professions O
were O
affected O
too O
. O

Jewish O
theatre B-TER
and O
cinema O
proprietors O
lost O
their O
licences O
. O

The O
press B-TER
was O
de O
- O
jewified O
. O

All O
of O
these O
legal B-TER
measures I-TER
, O
which O
in O
their O
detail O
were O
full O
of O
multiple O
clauses O
and O
in O
their O
complexity O
gave O
great O
scope O
to O
the O
most O
devious O
administrative O
interpretations O
and O
applications O
, O
resulted O
in O
great O
unemployment O
among O
Jews O
. O

Although O
the O
wording O
of O
the O
Law B-TER
provided O
for O
a O
stage O
- O
by O
- O
stage O
implementation O
lasting O
over O
several O
years O
, O
31 O
December O
1939 O
did O
constitute O
an O
important O
marker O
date O
for O
dismissals B-TER
, O
and O
so O
I O
was O
a O
witness O
shortly O
after O
my O
arrival O
to O
thousands O
and O
thousands O
of O
Jewish O
employees O
losing O
their O
livelihood O
. O

Everybody O
to O
whom O
I O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
speak O
– O
which O
later O
on O
included O
not O
only O
the O
man O
in O
the O
street O
but O
also O
circles O
of O
people O
with O
inside O
knowledge O
– O
was O
unanimously O
and O
firmly O
convinced O
that O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
economic I-TER
policies I-TER
of O
the O
government B-TER
were O
due O
to O
external O
pressure O
. O

The O
Nazis O
were O
at O
the O
borders O
, O
the O
Nazis O
had O
helped O
the O
Hungarians B-LOC
to O
territorial O
gains O
– O
following O
the O
Munich B-LOC
agreement O
and O
the O
collapse O
of O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
Carpathian B-LOC
Ruthenia I-LOC
and O
some O
Slovak B-LOC
areas O
were O
ceded O
to O
Hungary B-LOC
– O
and O
now O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
had O
to O
pay O
the O
price O
. O

They O
also O
had O
to O
bear O
in O
mind O
that O
internally O
there O
was O
a O
powerful O
German B-LOC
minority B-TER
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Swabians B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
vociferously O
making O
pro B-TER
- I-TER
Nazi I-TER
propaganda I-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
far O
- O
right O
Fascist B-TER
party I-TER
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
, O
and O
the O
government B-TER
’s I-TER
Jewish O
policy B-TER
had O
to O
take O
the O
wind O
out O
of O
their O
sails O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
organisations I-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
for O
their O
part O
took O
measures O
to O
help O
economically B-TER
victimised I-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
supporting O
those O
dismissed B-TER
, O
moving O
the O
unemployed O
into O
other O
occupations O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Since O
I O
had O
experience O
of O
working B-TER
in O
just O
this O
area O
of O
economic B-TER
policy I-TER
, O
I O
was O
asked O
by O
the O
leaders B-TER
of O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
congregation B-TER
, O
the O
chairman O
Samuel B-PER
Stern I-PER
and O
the O
general O
secretary O
Mr O
Eppler B-PER
, O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
work B-TER
of O
the O
newly O
established O
agencies O
. O

On O
taking O
up O
this O
work B-TER
I O
found O
a O
mood O
among O
the O
members O
of O
the O
congregation B-TER
similar O
to O
that O
which O
had O
prevailed O
in O
April O
1933 O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Many O
thousands O
of O
our O
fellow O
Jews O
sought O
advice O
and O
assistance O
from O
the O
congregation B-TER
, O
our O
offices O
were O
as O
good O
as O
besieged O
by O
them O
daily O
. O

The O
large O
congregation B-TER
building O
located O
in O
Sip B-LOC
utca I-LOC
was O
insufficient O
, O
and O
so O
new O
headquarters O
was O
set O
up O
on O
Bethlen B-LOC
ter I-LOC
. O

The O
offices O
in O
this O
building O
, O
which O
had O
previously O
been O
used O
for O
school B-TER
purposes O
, O
were O
under O
construction O
when O
I O
began O
working O
there O
in O
January O
1940 O
. O

The O
work O
took O
place O
under O
the O
auspices O
of O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
congregation B-TER
, O
but O
it O
ranged O
over O
the O
whole O
country O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
to O
have O
the O
work B-TER
carried O
out O
by O
two O
parallel O
organisations B-TER
, O
both O
of O
which O
were O
based O
in O
the O
building O
on O
Bethlen B-LOC
ter I-LOC
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
OMZSA B-ORG
( O
short O
for O
Orszagos B-ORG
Magyar I-ORG
Zaido I-ORG
Segitoe I-ORG
Akcio I-ORG
) O
, O
which O
was O
tasked O
with O
procuring O
the O
resources O
for O
the O
aid B-TER
programme I-TER
through O
large O
collections O
across O
the O
whole O
country O
. O

The O
other O
was O
Partfogo B-ORG
- I-ORG
Iroda I-ORG
( O
support B-TER
office I-TER
) O
, O
which O
was O
responsible O
for O
distributing O
the O
support O
and O
providing O
practical O
economic B-TER
assistance I-TER
. O

Its O
main O
departments O
were O
: O
welfare B-TER
, O
arranging O
employment B-TER
, O
changes B-TER
of I-TER
occupation I-TER
, O
emigration B-TER
, O
refugee B-TER
care O
, O
legal B-TER
advice O
, O
loans B-TER
. O

Among O
the O
many O
hundreds O
and O
thousands O
who O
found O
their O
way O
every O
day O
to O
the O
offices O
on O
Bethlen B-LOC
ter I-LOC
the O
main O
contingent O
was O
made O
up O
of O
unemployed O
workers B-TER
who O
had O
been O
thrown B-TER
out I-TER
of I-TER
their I-TER
jobs I-TER
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Laws I-TER
. O

There O
were O
two O
ways O
in O
which O
they O
could O
be O
helped O
. O

The O
first O
was O
by O
arranging O
employment B-TER
directly O
. O

There O
were O
still O
a O
large O
number O
of O
Jewish O
employers O
in O
whose O
business B-TER
or O
trade B-TER
the O
percentage O
of O
Jewish O
employees O
laid O
down O
had O
not O
been O
exceeded O
or O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
reached O
, O
so O
that O
they O
were O
in O
a O
position O
to O
engage O
additional O
Jewish O
workers B-TER
. O

Tracking O
down O
these O
possibilities O
and O
getting O
the O
employers O
concerned O
to O
do O
their O
duty O
by O
their O
jobless O
fellow O
Jews O
, O
even O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
material O
sacrifices O
, O
was O
hard O
and O
difficult O
work B-TER
, O
which O
however O
in O
many O
cases O
we O
did O
successfully O
carry O
out O
. O

The O
second O
way O
was O
by O
redeployment B-TER
in O
manual O
occupations O
in O
which O
there O
was O
still O
room O
for O
Jews O
. O

To O
this O
end O
we O
arranged O
a O
number O
of O
redeployment B-TER
courses I-TER
and O
training B-TER
programmes I-TER
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
make O
use O
of O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
experience O
I O
had O
gained O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
the O
previous O
years O
and O
to O
give O
much O
advice O
, O
although O
in O
many O
respects O
the O
problems O
faced O
were O
different O
. O

Difficulties O
came O
from O
two O
quarters O
. O

First O
, O
the O
authorities B-TER
. O

In O
their O
individual O
offices O
there O
was O
no O
consistent O
line O
about O
their O
attitude O
to O
the O
social O
work B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
organisations I-TER
. O

The O
general O
framework O
was O
laid O
down O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Laws I-TER
, O
but O
the O
implementation O
of O
them O
in O
concrete O
individual O
cases O
varied O
according O
to O
the O
workings O
of O
the O
lower O
levels O
of O
bureaucracy O
. O

But O
that O
depended O
in O
turn O
on O
quite O
uncontrollable O
and O
unpredictable O
influences O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
on O
whether O
there O
was O
an O
official O
sympathetic O
to O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
in O
the O
appropriate O
department O
or O
someone O
open O
to O
humane O
arguments O
. O

It O
depended O
very O
often O
on O
the O
general O
mood O
in O
the O
country O
, O
which O
changed O
according O
to O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

If O
there O
were O
reports O
from O
the O
front B-TER
which O
were O
unfavourable O
for O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
it O
had O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
mood O
right O
down O
to O
the O
smallest O
administrative O
office O
in O
some O
godforsaken O
Hungarian B-LOC
one O
- O
horse O
town O
, O
the O
most O
dyed O
- O
in O
- O
the O
wool O
antisemites B-TER
fell O
silent O
, O
and O
on O
such O
days O
the O
Jews O
could O
to O
some O
extent O
feel O
safe O
from O
any O
dirty O
tricks O
by O
the O
authorities B-TER
. O

But O
if O
things O
were O
going O
the O
other O
way O
– O
and O
unfortunately O
in O
that O
first O
period O
of O
the O
war B-TER
they O
usually O
were O
– O
if O
the O
Germans B-LOC
landed O
in O
Norway B-LOC
or O
broke O
through O
the O
Maginot O
line O
in O
France B-LOC
or O
dropped O
parachute O
troops O
in O
Crete B-LOC
, O
then O
the O
Jews O
all O
round O
the O
Sip B-LOC
utca I-LOC
had O
a O
bad O
day O
. O

Hungary B-LOC
was O
still O
neutral B-TER
, O
but O
the O
populace O
followed O
events O
in O
the O
war B-TER
feverishly O
and O
despite O
all O
the O
complexity O
of O
internal B-TER
politics I-TER
fell O
broadly O
speaking O
into O
only O
two O
camps O
: O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
the O
pro- O
Germans B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
also O
Jew B-TER
- I-TER
haters I-TER
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
the O
anti- O
Germans B-LOC
, O
whose O
attitude O
to O
the O
Jews O
was O
in O
some O
measure O
benign O
. O

The O
varying O
but O
generally O
nasty O
attitude O
of O
the O
administrative O
authorities O
made O
our O
work O
hugely O
more O
difficult O
. O

Thus O
for O
example O
every O
redeployment B-TER
course I-TER
was O
subject O
to O
authorisation O
. O

And O
this O
authorisation O
was O
very O
often O
denied O
or O
– O
what O
was O
worse O
– O
simply O
revoked O
after O
the O
course B-TER
had O
already O
started O
and O
considerable O
funds O
and O
effort O
had O
been O
put O
into O
it O
. O

I O
recall O
the O
huge O
amount O
of O
inconvenience O
and O
running O
around O
caused O
by O
every O
single O
case O
, O
how O
often O
one O
ministry O
negated O
what O
the O
other O
had O
approved O
after O
long O
official O
processes O
, O
how O
in O
any O
number O
of O
cases O
at O
the O
end O
a O
subordinate O
police B-TER
officer I-TER
wrecked O
the O
work B-TER
of O
many O
months O
by O
some O
trick O
or O
other O
. O

Every O
junior O
official O
and O
bureaucrat O
acted O
like O
a O
dictator O
towards O
the O
Jews O
, O
the O
fate O
of O
hundreds O
of O
human O
beings O
depended O
on O
his O
good O
or O
bad O
humour B-TER
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
it O
was O
sometimes O
possible O
by O
means O
of O
greasing O
a O
palm O
to O
achieve O
instantly O
what O
otherwise O
would O
have O
been O
pursued O
in O
vain O
for O
months O
. O

The O
other O
difficulty O
arose O
from O
the O
mentality O
of O
our O
own O
people O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
– O
if O
something O
hit O
them O
hard O
– O
could O
easily O
get O
into O
a O
mood O
of O
panic O
, O
but O
usually O
that O
subsided O
and O
gave O
way O
to O
the O
general O
nonchalance O
which O
is O
a O
fundamental O
trait O
not O
only O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
but O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
people O
as O
a O
whole O
, O
above O
all O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
. O

Despite O
all O
the O
hardships O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
everyone O
to O
whom O
I O
spoke O
at O
that O
time O
was O
optimistic O
, O
and O
nobody O
had O
the O
slightest O
idea O
of O
what O
was O
to O
come O
. O

The O
general O
view O
was O
: O
the O
war B-TER
wo O
n’t O
last O
long O
; O
the O
Nazis O
will O
collapse O
in O
the O
near O
future O
; O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
will O
get O
off O
with O
a O
black O
eye O
; O
so O
it O
’s O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
surviving O
this O
short O
time O
as O
easily O
as O
possible O
. O

With O
this O
attitude O
it O
was O
no O
surprise O
that O
individuals O
turned O
to O
the O
congregation B-TER
when O
they O
needed O
support B-TER
, O
that O
wealthier O
people O
were O
inclined O
to O
give O
money B-TER
– O
but O
nobody O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
put O
in O
any O
very O
great O
trouble O
or O
effort O
. O

Thus O
for O
example O
most O
people O
considered O
it O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
to O
take O
a O
redeployment B-TER
course I-TER
, O
as O
they O
were O
absolutely O
convinced O
that O
the O
whole O
Nazi O
madness O
would O
be O
over O
in O
a O
short O
time O
and O
they O
could O
then O
return O
to O
their O
old O
professions O
. O

This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
relatively O
few O
people O
expressed O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
redeployment B-TER
courses I-TER
and O
why O
, O
when O
after O
countless O
difficulties O
we O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
starting O
such O
a O
course B-TER
, O
the O
numbers O
attending O
soon O
crumbled O
away O
. O

Under O
these O
circumstances O
the O
work B-TER
of O
redeployment B-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
at O
that O
time O
was O
no O
great O
success O
. O

In O
Germany B-LOC
it O
had O
mainly O
been O
the O
emigrants B-TER
who O
wanted O
to O
learn O
a O
new B-TER
profession I-TER
before O
their O
departure B-TER
. O

In O
Hungary B-LOC
this O
motive O
did O
not O
apply O
either O
, O
since O
emigration B-TER
was O
no O
longer O
possible O
after O
autumn O
1939 O
. O

One O
small O
exception O
was O
the O
illegal B-TER
Aliyah O
, O
which O
since O
1940 O
went O
via O
Romania B-LOC
and O
the O
Black B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
, O
but O
was O
insignificant O
in O
terms O
of O
numbers O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
March O
or O
beginning O
of O
April O
1940 O
– O
the O
country O
was O
still O
neutral B-TER
and O
therefore O
connections O
with O
the O
West O
had O
not O
been O
entirely O
broken O
off O
– O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
headquarters O
in O
Paris B-LOC
of O
the O
ORT B-ORG
organisation I-ORG
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
to O
discuss O
an O
expansion O
of O
the O
redeployment B-TER
work B-TER
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
negotiations O
with O
him O
a O
local O
ORT B-ORG
group O
was O
formed O
, O
which O
took O
over O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
redeployment B-TER
schemes O
and O
also O
continued O
the O
training B-TER
courses I-TER
which O
were O
already O
in O
place O
. O

The O
congregation B-TER
in O
Budapest B-LOC
of O
course B-TER
welcomed O
this O
warmly O
, O
since O
it O
represented O
a O
financial B-TER
relief O
. O

The O
ORT B-ORG
group O
ran O
an O
office O
of O
its O
own O
on O
the O
Ringstrasse O
, O
but O
its O
work B-TER
ground O
to O
a O
halt O
completely O
after O
Hungary B-LOC
entered O
the O
war B-TER
. O

As O
well O
as O
arranging O
employment B-TER
and O
redeployment B-TER
I O
was O
interested O
above O
all O
in O
another O
part O
of O
the O
work B-TER
, O
which O
at O
precisely O
that O
time O
– O
the O
beginning O
of O
1940 O
– O
was O
growing O
in O
importance O
, O
namely O
caring B-TER
for O
refugees B-TER
. O

In O
the O
previous O
year O
many O
Jews O
from O
Poland B-LOC
had O
fled O
from O
the O
German B-TER
invasion I-TER
across O
the O
Carpathians B-LOC
into O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
but O
many O
also O
came O
with O
or O
without O
passports B-TER
to O
Hungary B-LOC
from O
Austria B-LOC
and O
other O
Nazi B-TER
- I-TER
controlled I-TER
areas I-TER
. O

Initially O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
treated O
them O
humanely O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
made O
no O
distinction O
between O
Jewish B-TER
and O
non O
- O
Jewish O
refugees B-TER
from O
Poland B-LOC
. O

It O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
Polish B-ORG
army I-ORG
in O
September O
1939 O
many O
thousands O
of O
Poles B-LOC
fled O
, O
partly O
from O
the O
Nazis O
advancing O
from O
the O
west O
and O
partly O
from O
the O
Bolsheviks O
approaching O
from O
the O
east O
, O
and O
crossed O
the O
passes O
in O
the O
Carpathians B-LOC
to O
seek O
refuge O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Romania B-LOC
. O

Even O
small O
military B-TER
units I-TER
up O
to O
battalion O
strength O
crossed O
the O
border O
as O
a O
body O
and O
allowed O
themselves O
to O
be O
disarmed O
here O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-LOC
authorities O
interned O
them O
at O
first O
, O
but O
then O
allowed O
them O
greater O
freedom O
of O
movement O
and O
turned O
a O
blind O
eye O
when O
they O
continued O
on O
to O
Yugoslav B-LOC
territory O
, O
pushing O
on O
from O
there O
by O
detours O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
of O
the O
Western O
powers O
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
1940 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
authorities B-TER
began O
to O
change O
their O
attitude O
towards O
the O
refugees B-TER
. O

A O
practice O
developed O
of O
placing O
those O
refugees B-TER
remaining O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
under O
police O
supervision O
but O
otherwise O
leaving O
them O
free O
, O
while O
those O
among O
them O
who O
were O
Jewish O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
internment B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

Within O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
a O
special O
unit O
was O
created O
, O
called O
KHECK O
, O
which O
gradually O
showed O
a O
tendency O
to O
round O
up O
and O
intern O
all O
anti- O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
who O
had O
entered O
the O
country O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
i.e. O
stateless B-TER
Jews O
and O
those O
of O
uncertain O
nationality O
. O

The O
intensification O
of O
this O
course O
of O
action O
, O
and O
the O
arbitrary O
interpretation O
of O
its O
provisions O
were O
later O
to O
become O
fateful O
for O
me O
and O
my O
family O
too O
, O
though O
at O
this O
point O
I O
did O
not O
foresee O
any O
of O
it O
, O
but O
felt O
comfortable O
and O
secure O
, O
as O
I O
had O
after O
all O
entered O
the O
country O
with O
a O
legal O
and O
valid O
passport B-TER
issued O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
consulate B-TER
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1939 O
- O
1940 O
the O
Jews O
placed O
in O
the O
internment B-TER
camps I-TER
were O
accommodated B-TER
under O
very O
unfavourable O
conditions O
from O
a O
hygienic B-TER
point O
of O
view O
. O

With O
a O
view O
to O
alleviating O
their O
situation O
the O
agencies B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish O
congregation B-TER
approached O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
and O
these O
negotiations O
met O
with O
some O
success O
. O

Although O
the O
request O
for O
release B-TER
of O
the O
interned B-TER
Jews O
was O
rejected O
, O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
did O
agree O
to O
assemble O
the O
Jews O
in O
special O
camps B-TER
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
capital B-LOC
, O
provided O
the O
Jewish O
congregation B-TER
agreed O
to O
find O
the O
financial B-TER
resources O
for O
the O
maintenance O
of O
these O
camps B-TER
. O

The O
congregation B-TER
proceeded O
in O
the O
following O
months O
to O
construct O
and O
make O
available O
temporary O
buildings B-TER
on O
their O
own O
plots O
of O
land O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
resources O
to O
do O
so O
were O
found O
by O
longstanding O
and O
wealthy O
Jewish O
families O
; O
Baroness O
Alice B-PER
Weiss I-PER
, O
a O
member O
of O
an O
extremely O
rich O
family O
of O
industrialists B-TER
, O
made O
an O
outstanding O
contribution O
, O
not O
only O
by O
donating O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
but O
also O
by O
personally O
concerning O
herself O
with O
hygiene B-TER
arrangements O
in O
the O
camps B-TER
and O
becoming O
involved O
in O
particular O
in O
providing O
for O
the O
interned O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

Some O
of O
the O
camps B-TER
were O
given O
their O
own O
kosher B-TER
kitchens I-TER
; O
where O
that O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
deliveries O
of O
food B-TER
were O
made O
to O
them O
from O
central O
places O
run O
by O
the O
congregation B-TER
. O

The O
internees B-TER
received O
numerous O
benefits O
through O
us O
, O
with O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
authorities B-TER
, O
and O
were O
provided O
with O
warm B-TER
clothing I-TER
, O
linen O
, O
pocket O
money O
and O
medications B-TER
. O

Visiting O
days O
were O
introduced O
, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
permission O
was O
also O
given O
for O
them O
to O
go O
out O
in O
the O
city O
. O

If O
internees B-TER
fell O
ill B-TER
, O
they O
could O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
hospital I-TER
. O

I O
inspected O
these O
camps B-TER
frequently O
and O
took O
an O
active O
interest O
in O
the O
welfare B-TER
of O
the O
inmates B-TER
– O
without O
suspecting O
that O
one O
year O
later O
I O
would O
be O
one O
of O
them O
. O

My O
role O
in O
the O
congregation B-TER
agencies O
came O
to O
a O
temporary O
end O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1940 O
when O
I O
– O
together O
with O
many O
fellow O
Jews O
of O
my O
age O
– O
was O
called O
up O
for O
work B-TER
service I-TER
. O

This O
work O
service O
( O
called O
munkaszolgalat O
in O
Hungarian B-LOC
) O
was O
a O
nasty O
trick O
and O
an O
act O
of O
discrimination B-TER
specially O
devised O
and O
set O
up O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
view O
of O
the O
Ministry B-TER
of O
War O
was O
that O
Jews O
were O
not O
suitable O
for O
military B-TER
service I-TER
, O
because O
they O
were O
unreliable O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
it O
was O
felt O
inappropriate O
to O
leave O
the O
Jews O
at O
home B-TER
at O
a O
time O
when O
many O
generations O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
were O
being O
called O
up O
. O

Special O
work O
companies O
were O
therefore O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
Jews O
as O
well O
as O
members O
of O
unreliable O
national O
minorities B-TER
( O
Romanians B-LOC
, O
Slovaks B-LOC
etc O
. O

) O
were O
enrolled O
. O

It O
was O
doubtless O
no O
pleasure O
at O
that O
time O
to O
serve O
in O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
army I-ORG
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
work O
companies O
were O
concerned O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
pure O
hell O
. O

For O
reasons O
which O
have O
never O
become O
entirely O
clear O
, O
it O
was O
predominantly O
men B-TER
who O
were O
not O
particularly O
young O
who O
were O
called O
up O
. O

For O
them O
the O
unaccustomed O
work B-TER
( O
road O
mending O
, O
cleaning O
barracks O
etc O
. O

) O
was O
especially O
hard O
. O

Our O
lodgings O
and O
food B-TER
as O
well O
as O
our O
treatment O
by O
the O
( O
usually O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
- I-TER
minded I-TER
) O
superior O
officers O
were O
extremely O
bad O
. O

But O
fortunately O
the O
work B-TER
companies O
in O
this O
first O
period O
were O
only O
used O
within O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
were O
dissolved O
again O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
or O
months O
. O

In O
the O
late O
summer O
and O
autumn O
people O
returned O
to O
their O
homes B-TER
. O

Soon O
the O
hardships O
suffered O
were O
forgotten O
and O
, O
as O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
economic B-TER
situation I-TER
improved O
somewhat O
and O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
place O
many O
of O
the O
unemployed B-TER
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
in O
1940 O
the O
prevalent O
feeling O
among O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
was O
again O
that O
they O
had O
got O
off O
with O
a O
black O
eye O
. O

But O
the O
hard O
persecutions O
had O
not O
yet O
begun O

The O
following O
declarations O
were O
made O
by O
a O
Jewish B-TER
refugee I-TER
who O
had O
recently O
arrived O
in O
Switzerland B-LOC

The O
refugee B-TER
was O
arrested B-TER
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Brussels B-LOC
during O
a O
round B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
of O
Jews O
and O
was O
interned B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
at I-LOC
Malines I-LOC
, O
Mechelen O
where O
he O
was O
kept O
for O
three O
days O
with O
thousands O
of O
Jewish O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

Some O
of O
them O
had O
received O
an O
order B-TER
to O
report O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
equipped O
with O
belongings O
and O
enough O
rations B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O

The O
others O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
like O
him O
in O
the O
street O
, O
with O
no O
advance O
warning O
. O

At O
the O
camp B-LOC
the O
children B-TER
under O
fourteen O
were O
separated O
from O
the O
adults O
, O
the O
men B-TER
over O
sixty O
were O
sent O
home B-TER

He O
does O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

After O
three O
days O
at O
the O
camp B-LOC
he O
was O
designated O
for O
deportation B-TER
with O
many O
of O
the O
men B-TER
, O
most O
of O
them O
young O
. O

All O
they O
had O
with O
them O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
received O
official O
summonses O
and O
consequently O
had O
luggage O
with O
them O
had O
to O
leave O
it O
behind O
. O

They O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
keep O
the O
food B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
in O
the O
street O
and O
had O
nothing O
with O
them O
were O
given O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

At O
the O
station O
, O
before O
they O
boarded O
the O
train B-TER
, O
there O
was O
a O
second O
inspection O

Each O
person O
had O
to O
put O
into O
a O

any O

he O
had O
on O
him O
: O
rings O

From O
some O
of O
them O
the O
German B-LOC
inspectors O
took O

they O
took O
a O
liking O

After O
this O
last O
inspection O
they O
were O
herded O
into O
a O
dozen O
cattle B-TER
wagons I-TER

Our O
refugee B-TER
was O
shoved O
into O
a O
wagon B-TER
with O
seventy O
other O
men B-TER

They O
were O
squeezed O
in O
like O

in O
a O

Impossible O

Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
and O
the O
train B-TER
was O
cleared O
. O

Several O
of O
the O
weaker O
deportees B-TER
had O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
our O
informer O
saw O
seven O
of O
these O
carried O
off O
. O

At O
the O
station O
they O
were O
given O
hot O
soup B-TER
from O
large O
tureens O
marked O
with O
red B-ORG
crosses I-ORG
. O

It O
was O
probably O
a O
distribution O
organised O
by O
the O
German B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

Then O
the O
fourteen- O
to O
twenty O
- O
year O
- O
olds O
, O
who O
made O
up O
about O
half O
the O
convoy O
, O
were O
taken O
away O
. O

It O
seems O
they O
were O
to O
work O
in O
heavy O
industry B-TER
and O
in O
the O
mines B-TER
of O
Königshütte B-LOC
and O
its O
surrounding O
area O
. O

Other O
deportees B-TER
got O
back O
into O
the O
wagons B-TER
where O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
space O
and O
the O
train B-TER
set O
off O
towards O
the O
east O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
recognised O
Lvov B-LOC
( O
Lemberg B-LOC
) O
, O
then O
Rava B-LOC
- I-LOC
Russka I-LOC
and O
a O
region O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
too O
exhausted O
to O
notice O
how O
long O
the O
journey O
lasted O
. O

The O
train B-TER
stopped O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. O

The O
deportees B-TER
were O
gathered O
together O
at O
the O
station O
. O

Each O
one O
was O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
fit O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Half O
of O
them O
, O
about O
150 O
men B-TER
mostly O
aged O
between O
twenty O
and O
thirty O
- O
five O
, O
said O
they O
were O
. O

The O
others O
said O
they O
were O
not O
and O
were O
taken O
away O
, O
whilst O
the O
first O
group O
got O
back O
on O
the O
train B-TER
and O
continued O
the O
journey O
for O
half O
a O
day O
more O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
does O
not O
know O
exactly O
in O
which O
region O
they O
arrived O
. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
distant O
region O
, O
deep O
inside O
Russia B-LOC
– O
he O
noticed O
a O
signpost O
indicating O
Stalingrad O
50 O
km O
, O
and O
whilst O
he O
was O
in O
this O
region O
he O
heard O
the O
noise O
of O
bombing B-TER
and O
gunfire B-TER
two O
or O
three O
times O
, O
suggesting O
they O
were O
close O
to O
the O
battle B-TER
field I-TER
. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
arrived O
the O
men B-TER
were O
taken O
in O
groups O
to O
huts B-TER
and O
were O
given O
work B-TER
clothes I-TER
. O

These O
were O
khaki O
uniforms B-TER

worn O
by O
the O

but O
without O
the O

with O
the O

Our O
informer O
was O
put O
into O
a O
group O
of O
sixty O
men B-TER
. O

Other O
teams O
worked O
in O
the O
same O
area O
as O
his O
, O
and O
he O
noticed O
nearby O
a O
group O
of O
French B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
, O
as O
he O
realised O
when O
he O
heard O
them O
speaking O
their O
language O
. O

A O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
confirmed O
to O
him O
later O
that O
this O
observation O
was O
correct O
. O

The O
huts B-TER
reserved O
for O
the O
deportees B-TER
were O
the O
same O
as O
the O
German B-ORG
army I-ORG
uses O
for O
its O
men B-TER
. O

There O
were O
bunk O
beds O
, O
in O
threes O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
. O

They O
were O
probably O
constructing O
fortifications O
for O
the O
eastern O
front O
. O

The O
men B-TER
had O
to O
carry O
over O
a O
long O
distance O
heavy O
sacks O
of O
cement O
weighing O
more O
than O
fifty O
kilos O
. O

There O
were O
also O
large O
iron O
grids O
from O
which O
they O
made O
sort O
of O
anti O
- O
tank O
barriers O
. O

They O
were O
forced O
to O
work B-TER
for O
ten O
hours O
each O
day O
and O
since O
they O
had O
to O
walk O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
and O
from O
the O
huts B-TER
to O
the O
work B-TER
site I-TER
, O
the O
working B-TER
day I-TER
was O
in O
reality O
twelve O
hours O
, O
from O
six O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
six O
at O
night O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
were O
completely O
exhausted O
. O

Supervisors O
constantly O
harried O
the O
men B-TER
, O
as O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
square O
metres O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
daily O
. O

Talking O
was O
not O
allowed O
during O
working B-TER
hours I-TER
. O

They O
worked B-TER
on O
Sundays O
the O
same O
as O
on O
weekdays O
, O
apparently O
not O
being O
allowed O
to O
rest O
until O
the O
fifth O
Sunday O
. O

As O
for O
food B-TER
, O
the O
men O
received O
a O
900 O
- O
gram O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
that O
is O
225 O
grams O
per O
man B-TER
, O
each O
day O
. O

At O
midday O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
hot O
soup B-TER
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
a O
blackish O
liquid O
called O
coffee B-TER
, O
with O
a O
little O
saccharine B-TER
. O

In O
the O
evenings O
they O
all O
fell O
asleep O
, O
exhausted O
. O

All O
conversation O
was O
forbidden O
. O

Writing B-TER
was O
not O
possible O
. O

For O
a O
week O
our O
informer O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
like O
all O
the O
others O
. O

Then O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
drivers O
had O
disappeared O
, O
one O
of O
the O
supervising O
officers B-TER
asked O
if O
anyone O
knew O
how O
to O
drive O
. O

As O
he O
had O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
Ford B-PER
factories B-TER
in O
Brussels B-LOC
our O
refugee B-TER
was O
chosen O
and O
from O
then O
on O
drove O
this O
officer B-TER
’s I-TER
car O
, O
accompanying O
him O
on O
all O
his O
tours O
of O
duty O
. O

They O
came O
to O
like O
each O
other O
and O
the O
officer B-TER
was O
quite O
open O
with O
him O
. O

He O
was O
a O
young O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
of O
about O
twenty O
- O
five O
. O

He O
was O
originally O
from O
Bavaria B-LOC
, O
and O
had O
already O
earned O
three O
stars O
; O
he O
had O
lost O
two O
brothers O
in O
the O
war B-TER
and O
had O
left O
behind O
a O
young O
wife B-TER
and O
small O
child B-TER
. O

He O
said O
he O
was O
totally O
disgusted O
by O
the O
war B-TER
and O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
war B-TER
was O
already O
lost O
, O
and O
he O
hated O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
had O
been O
done O
, O
and O
was O
still O
being O
done O
, O
to O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
information O
that O
follows O
came O
to O
our O
refugee B-TER
from O
this O
officer B-TER
. O

Having O
asked O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
the O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
had O
arrived O
with O
his O
group O
and O
who O
had O
been O
found O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
, O
he O
was O
told O
by O
the O
officer B-TER
that O
they O
all O
been O
executed B-TER
; O
the O
officer B-TER
added O
that O
this O
was O
the O
fate O
of O
all O
those O
who O
, O
through O
exhaustion O
, O
could O
no O
longer O
work B-TER
. O

The O
officer B-TER
was O
unhappy O
with O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
but O
could O
do O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
it O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
begged O
him O
not O
to O
keep O
harassing O
the O
Jews O
at O
work B-TER
, O
but O
the O
officer B-TER
explained O
that O
he O
had O
to O
do O
it O
, O
because O
he O
was O
obliged O
ensure O
that O
a O
certain O
quantity O
of O
work B-TER
was O
completed O
each O
day O
. O

The O
means O
of O
exterminating B-TER
the O
Jews O
who O
were O
incapable O
of O
work B-TER
, O
said O
the O
officer B-TER
, O
was O
to O
line O
them O
up O
against O
a O
wall O
and O
shoot B-TER
them O
, O
or O
if O
this O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
by O
poisoning B-TER
their O
food B-TER
. O

Our O
man B-TER
spent O
two O
weeks O
with O
this O
officer B-TER
, O
who O
behaved O
like O
a O
gentleman O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
this O
time O
, O
the O
officer B-TER
told O
him O
that O
a O
very O
rare O
chance O
of O
escape B-TER
was O
available O
to O
him O
. O

Every O
two O
or O
three O
months O
a O
train B-TER
left O
for O
the O
west O
and O
the O
following O
day O
was O
the O
very O
day O
of O
its O
departure O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
insisted O
he O
should O
seize O
this O
chance O
, O
which O
would O
not O
recur O
. O

He O
himself O
hid O
him O
in O
a O
goods O
wagon B-TER
full O
of O
parcels B-TER
and O
sacks O
, O
he O
gave O
him O
plenty O
of O
provisions O
( O
bread B-TER
, O
conserves B-TER
etc O
) O
for O
the O
journey O
and O
two O
Reichsmarks O
( O
the O
currency O
of O
the O
occupation O
) O
. O

He O
told O
him O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
his O
uniform B-TER
, O
that O
these O
uniforms B-TER
were O
worn O
in O
all O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER
. O

After O
checking O
that O
the O
wagon B-TER
was O
properly O
sealed O
the O
officer B-TER
notified O
one O
of O
the O
train B-TER
employees O
of O
our O
traveller O
’s O
presence O
and O
it O
was O
thus O
that O
he O
made O
for O
the O
west O
, O
hidden B-TER
beneath O
a O
pile O
of O
sacks O
. O

Being O
in O
the O
dark O
he O
could O
not O
distinguish O
night O
from O
day O
, O
he O
could O
just O
see O
a O
little O
light O
through O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
wagon B-TER
, O
so O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
how O
long O
the O
journey O
took O
. O

Amongst O
the O
sacks O
in O
the O
wagon B-TER
he O
noticed O
some O
that O
contained O
black O
[ O
probably O
SS B-ORG
] O
uniforms B-TER
. O

He O
stayed O
like O
this O
until O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
. O

When O
the O
man B-TER
who O
had O
been O
informed O
of O
his O
presence O
opened O
the O
wagon B-TER
he O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
in O
the O
goods O
yard O
of O
the O
Gare O
de O
l’Est O
in O
Paris O
. O

He O
was O
shown O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
station O
and O
he O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
home B-TER
of O
one O
of O
his O
brothers O
- O
in O
- O
law O
who O
lived O
in O
Paris B-LOC
. O

Having O
got O
some O
money O
and O
changed O
his O
clothes B-TER
, O
he O
left O
the O
city O
that O
evening O
and O
went O
to O
the O
free O
[ O
unoccupied O
] O
zone O
, O
from O
where O
he O
left O
for O
Switzerland B-LOC
, O
along O
with O
some O
other O
refugees B-TER
. O

His O
adventure O
had O
lasted O
six O
weeks O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
this O
man B-TER
in O
a O
Swiss B-LOC
hospital B-TER
. O

He O
was O
thirty O
- O
three O
years O
old O
, O
of O
robust O
appearance O
, O
the O
type O
who O
works B-TER
with O
machines O
, O
of O
nondescript O
appearance O
and O
average O
intelligence O
. O

He O
scarcely O
realises O
his O
extraordinary O
luck O
. O

He O
made O
a O
good O
impression O
on O
me O
, O
recounting O
quite O
simply O
the O
things O
he O
had O
seen O
, O
adding O
nothing O
that O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
personally O
. O

He O
often O
replied O
to O
my O
questions O
with O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

His O
accounts O
of O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
also O
accord O
with O
those O
of O
others O
who O
have O
arrived O
here O
. O

We O
should O
note O
, O
too O
, O
that O
he O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
his O
extraordinary O
odyssey O
to O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
authorities O
when O
they O
questioned O
him O
. O

He O
made O
no O
attempt O
whatsoever O
to O
make O
himself O
interesting O
to O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
authorities O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
he O
might O
perhaps O
obtain O
some O
special O
treatment O
. O

Besides O
all O
they O
asked O
was O
where O
he O
came O
from O
. O

He O
answered O
from O
Lyon O
. O

No O
other O
question O
having O
been O
asked O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
story O
to O
himself O
. O

by O
W. B-PER
Berent I-PER
My O
hometown O
is O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

There O
my O
father O
, O
Rechtsanwalt O
Lasker O
, O
had O
an O
extensive O
lawyer B-TER
’s I-TER
practice O
. O

When O
after O
having O
taken O
over O
the O
government B-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC
the O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
passed O
the O
Judengesetze O
my O
father O
was O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
pursue O
his O
profession O
in O
the O
way O
he O
had O
done O
. O

He O
was O
only O
allowed O
to O
work B-TER
as O
a O
law B-TER
consultant I-TER
without O
being O
called O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
continue O
like O
this O
until O
1941 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
in O
1939 O
, O
our O
flat B-TER
with O
all O
the O
furniture O
was O
confiscated B-TER
. O

My O
parents O
were O
forced O
to O
move O
together O
with O
me O
and O
my O
elder O
sister O
into O
the O
small O
flat B-TER
which O
belonged O
to O
an O
uncle O
and O
an O
aunt O
of O
mine O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
was O
still O
going O
to O
school B-TER
, O
but O
then O
took O
up O
the O
study O
of O
music B-TER
in O
order O
to O
become O
a O
cellist B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
which O
were O
taken O
against O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
, O
especially O
the O
restricted B-TER
allocations O
of O
food B-TER
, O
life B-TER
became O
very O
hard O
for O
us O
. O

In O
the O
years O
1941 O
- O
1942 O
the O
deportations B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
started O
. O

The O
first O
of O
us O
to O
suffer O
this O
harsh O
lot O
were O
my O
uncle O
and O
my O
aunt O
who O
had O
shared O
their O
flat B-TER
with O
us O
. O

In O
1942 O
both O
my O
father O
and O
my O
mother O
were O
also O
fetched O
from O
our O
flat B-TER
and O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
only O
sign O
of O
life O
that O
we O
received O
from O
them O
was O
a O
postcard B-TER
, O
which O
my O
father O
had O
sent O
to O
us O
from O
the O
Isbiza B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
near O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
never O
heard O
anything O
from O
them O
. O

Sometime O
later O
my O
grandmother O
, O
who O
was O
more O
than O
80 O
years O
old O
, O
was O
also O
finally O
deported B-TER
. O

She O
is O
said O
to O
have O
been O
taken O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Thus O
only O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
were O
left O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
, O
alone O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
, O
this O
flat B-TER
was O
also O
confiscated B-TER
. O

Soon O
afterwards O
the O
two O
of O
us O
had O
to O
move O
into O
an O
orphanage B-TER
. O

Since O
about O
1941 O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
had O
been O
assigned O
to O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
. O

I O
was O
16 O
years O
old O
at O
that O
time O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
in O
a O
paper O
factory B-TER
which O
was O
situated O
in O
a O
suburb O
far O
away O
from O
the O
City O
. O

Since O
Jews O
were O
forbidden B-TER
to I-TER
use I-TER
public I-TER
transport I-TER
we O
had O
to O
walk O
the O
whole O
long O
way O
. O

That O
meant O
that O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
home B-TER
as O
early O
as O
4 O
am O
when O
I O
was O
assigned O
for O
the O
early O
morning O
shift O
from O
6 O
am O
until O
2 O
pm O
. O

The O
second O
shift O
had O
to O
work B-TER
from O
2 O
pm O
until O
10 O
pm O
. O

The O
work B-TER
itself O
that O
we O
had O
to O
do O
was O
relatively O
clean O
and O
not O
too O
hard O
though O
the O
quota O
of O
work B-TER
that O
we O
had O
to O
achieve O
was O
gradually O
increased O
. O

But O
the O
pay O
I O
received O
was O
extremely O
small O
, O
about O
RM B-TER
7.00 O
per O
week O
. O

The O
money B-TER
was O
far O
from O
being O
sufficient O
for O
even O
the O
most O
essential O
necessities O
of O
life O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
any O
clothes B-TER
whatsoever O
. O

This O
problem O
, O
together O
with O
the O
small O
rations B-TER
of I-TER
food I-TER
that O
we O
Jews O
were O
allotted O
, O
made O
life O
almost O
unbearable O
. O

Besides O
Jews O
, O
Polish B-LOC
civilian B-TER
workers B-TER
, O
deported B-TER
French B-LOC
civilians B-TER
and O
French B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
who O
were O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
also O
worked B-TER
in O
this O
factory B-TER
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
speak O
French B-LOC
fluently O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
we O
soon O
made O
contact O
with O
them O
. O

The O
foreign O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
convicts O
and O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
were O
put O
up O
in O
barracks B-TER
. O

Many O
of O
the O
latter O
were O
planning O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

But O
they O
could O
not O
realise O
their O
intentions O
, O
because O
with O
the O
uniforms B-TER
they O
were O
wearing O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
them O
to O
contact O
people B-TER
in O
the O
town O
whose O
help B-TER
they O
could O
count O
on O
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
then O
decided O
to O
organise O
contacts O
with O
these O
people B-TER
who O
were O
ready O
to O
help B-TER
. O

To O
begin O
with O
we O
succeeded O
in O
providing O
civilian B-TER
clothes B-TER
for O
a O
number O
of O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
. O

Then O
we O
also O
helped B-TER
them O
to O
get O
false B-TER
documents I-TER
. O

To O
achieve O
this O
, O
we O
used O
the O
fact O
that O
foreign O
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
, O
including O
the O
French B-LOC
, O
among O
them O
men B-TER
and O
also O
women B-TER
, O
were O
from O
time O
to O
time O
granted O
a O
short O
holiday B-TER
at O
home O
. O

All O
we O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
disguise O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
as O
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
on O
holiday B-TER
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
we O
obtained O
, O
from O
prisoners B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
printing O
shops O
, O
the O
relevant O
forms O
, O
which O
we O
filled O
in O
ourselves O
in O
Gothic O
script O
for O
the O
individual O
people B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
a O
major O
number O
of O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
succeeded O
in O
fleeing B-TER
to O
that O
part O
of O
France B-LOC
which O
at O
that O
time O
was O
not O
yet O
occupied B-TER
. O

Finally O
, O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
and O
their O
helpers B-TER
everywhere O
in O
the O
town O
had O
known O
how O
valuable O
our O
help B-TER
had O
been O
for O
many O
prisoners B-TER
. O

In O
September O
1942 O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
flee B-TER
to O
France B-LOC
ourselves O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
we O
had O
helped B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
to O
escape B-TER
. O

We O
had O
been O
informed O
about O
authorities O
in O
France B-LOC
who O
would O
help B-TER
us O
there O
. O

So O
we O
filled O
in O
forms O
for O
holidays B-TER
for O
ourselves O
as O
alleged O
French B-LOC
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
and O
one O
day O
we O
went O
to O
the O
station O
with O
friends O
and O
some O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
with O
the O
same O
holiday B-TER
documents O
to O
set O
off O
on O
our O
journey O
. O

We O
were O
already O
sitting O
in O
the O
train B-TER
for O
Paris B-LOC
when O
- O
Gestapo B-ORG
officials B-TER
arrived O
and O
arrested B-TER
us O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fleeing B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
, O
and O
also O
our O
friends O
who O
had O
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
station O
. O

Later O
I O
learnt O
that O
at O
that O
time O
there O
were O
already O
rumours O
in O
the O
town O
that O
we O
had O
successfully O
escaped B-TER
from O
Germany B-LOC
and O
that O
in O
one O
church B-TER
a O
special O
prayer B-TER
had O
been O
said O
for O
us O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
who O
had O
suspected O
us O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
we O
knew O
the O
French B-LOC
language O
so O
well O
, O
had O
observed O
us O
closely O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

For O
at O
the O
same O
time O
our O
helpers B-TER
, O
whom O
we O
had O
in O
the O
town O
, O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

With O
some O
of O
these O
, O
who O
were O
also O
Jews O
, O
we O
were O
put O
together O
into O
the O
prison B-TER
cell O
which O
was O
reserved O
for O
Jews O
. O

That O
was O
very O
useful O
for O
us O
because O
thus O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discuss O
how O
we O
could O
defend O
ourselves O
. O

There O
was O
a O
rule O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
had O
to O
decide O
within O
21 O
days O
whether O
arrested B-TER
people B-TER
were O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
court B-TER
or O
to O
be O
sent O
immediately O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

We O
breathed O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
when O
we O
learnt O
that O
legal B-TER
proceedings I-TER
would O
be O
taken O
against O
us O
at O
the O
Volksgerichtshof O
and O
hoped O
to O
receive O
a O
really O
long O
time O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

We O
knew O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
always O
held O
arrested B-TER
Jews O
in O
their O
clutches O
. O

Even O
after O
a O
verdict O
of O
not O
guilty O
a O
Jew O
could O
not O
expect O
to O
be O
released B-TER
but O
was O
invariably O
taken O
into O
a O
camp B-TER
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
same O
of O
course O
happened O
after O
you O
had O
served O
your O
time O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

It O
took O
about O
a O
year O
until O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
were O
brought O
to O
trial B-TER
. O

During O
that O
time O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
tried O
several O
times O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
us O
in O
order O
to O
take O
us O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

But O
each O
time O
this O
was O
prevented O
by O
the O
judicial B-TER
authorities I-TER
. O

The O
trial B-TER
that O
then O
took O
place O
was O
rather O
farcical O
. O

We O
had O
no O
barrister O
and O
had O
to O
defend O
ourselves O
. O

My O
sister O
said O
she O
was O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
the O
actions O
and O
for O
this O
was O
sentenced O
to O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
in O
gaol B-TER
. O

I O
was O
sentenced O
to O
18 O
months O
in O
prison B-TER
for O
forging B-TER
documents I-TER
, O
helping B-TER
the O
enemy O
, O
trying O
to O
flee B-TER
and O
using O
false B-TER
documents I-TER
. O

My O
sister O
served O
her O
term O
in O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
gaol B-TER
in O
Jauer B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
in O
Breslau B-LOC
to O
serve O
my O
sentence O
. O

The O
Breslau B-LOC
prison B-TER
was O
mainly O
used O
for O
temporarily O
putting O
up O
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
transported B-TER
from O
there O
to O
other O
prisons B-TER
or O
into O
camps B-TER
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
food B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
was O
far O
worse O
than O
in O
other O
similar O
institutions O
. O

This O
caused O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
suffering O
. O

It O
was O
also O
rather O
unpleasant O
that O
the O
cell B-TER
which O
I O
had O
to O
share O
with O
three O
other O
inmates B-TER
was O
swarming O
with O
bugs B-TER
, O
lice B-TER
and O
fleas B-TER
. O

It O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
get O
used O
to O
this O
situation O
. O

The O
treatment O
I O
experienced O
was O
routine O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
in O
particular O
to O
complain O
about O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
quite O
a O
few O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
warders B-TER
, O
some O
of O
whom O
were O
recruited O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
civilians B-TER
, O
behaved O
towards O
me O
very O
decently O
, O
perhaps O
because O
they O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
the O
daughter B-TER
of O
Herr O
Lasker O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
. O

During O
my O
imprisonment B-TER
I O
was O
allotted O
all O
sorts O
of O
work B-TER
, O
which O
I O
did O
welcome O
because O
the O
time O
thus O
passed O
more O
quickly O
. O

There O
was O
one O
incident O
which O
was O
typical O
of O
the O
pedantic O
way O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities B-TER
proceeded O
. O

I O
had O
wanted O
to O
take O
four O
suitcases O
with O
me O
on O
the O
journey O
to O
France B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
was O
arrested B-TER
only O
three O
suitcases O
– O
as O
I O
realised O
later O
– O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
along O
with O
me O
. O

When O
it O
became O
known O
that O
one O
of O
my O
suitcases O
was O
missing O
they O
moved O
heaven O
and O
earth O
in O
order O
to O
find O
the O
suitcase O
. O

But O
at O
first O
all O
the O
searches O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

After O
a O
long O
time O
, O
they O
informed O
me O
, O
beaming O
with O
joy O
, O
that O
the O
suitcase O
had O
been O
found O
in O
Paris B-LOC
and O
had O
been O
transported O
back O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
for O
myself O
that O
this O
suitcase O
had O
not O
been O
broken O
open O
. O

That O
did O
not O
mean O
, O
however O
, O
that O
I O
got O
it O
back O
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
from O
prison B-TER
and O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
I O
did O
not O
see O
anything O
at O
all O
of O
my O
luggage O
again O
. O

I O
was O
released B-TER
from O
prison B-TER
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
camp I-LOC
in O
December O
1943 O
. O

We O
had O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
Auschwitz B-LOC
and O
there O
were O
also O
talks O
about O
the O
gassing B-TER
there O
but O
we O
could O
not O
really O
imagine O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

All O
we O
knew O
was O
that O
being O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
was O
the O
worst O
that O
could O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

So O
I O
also O
believed O
that O
this O
would O
be O
my O
last O
journey O
. O

When O
before O
the O
transport B-TER
I O
was O
first O
taken O
by O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
to O
the O
medical B-TER
examination I-TER
I O
asked O
the O
doctor B-TER
why O
he O
was O
taking O
all O
that O
unnecessary O
trouble O
. O

The O
doctor B-TER
tried O
to O
calm O
me O
, O
saying O
it O
would O
not O
be O
all O
that O
bad O
. O

After O
the O
examination B-TER
I O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
together O
with O
some O
other O
so O
- O
called O
Karteihäftlingen O
. O

Only O
later O
did O
I O
learn O
that O
Karteihäftlingen O
were O
those O
who O
had O
previously O
been O
sentenced O
to O
imprisonment B-TER
by O
a O
law B-TER
- I-TER
court I-TER
. O

Being O
one O
of O
them O
meant O
that O
you O
were O
safe O
from O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
because O
there O
might O
perhaps O
be O
a O
retrial O
of O
your O
case O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
night O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
, O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
belonging O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
were O
received O
there O
by O
SS B-TER
- O
women B-TER
in O
black O
capes B-TER
. O

We O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
a O
barracks B-TER
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
led O
into O
a O
room O
where O
we O
were O
tattooed O
and O
shaved O
and O
were O
due O
later O
to O
get O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

While O
I O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
stark O
naked O
and O
with O
only O
a O
toothbrush B-TER
in O
my O
hand O
, O
one O
of O
the O
wardens B-TER
approached O
me O
and O
asked O
me O
about O
my O
job B-TER
. O

I O
was O
astonished O
to O
see O
that O
my O
answer O
, O
namely O
that O
I O
was O
a O
cellist B-TER
, O
caused O
great O
excitement O
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
one O
side O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
there O
until O
they O
had O
finished O
with O
the O
others O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
they O
intended O
to O
do O
with O
me O
. O

But O
then O
I O
heard O
that O
I O
was O
regarded O
as O
an O
extremely O
valuable O
find O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
had O
an O
orchestra B-TER
, O
which O
was O
conducted O
by O
the O
well O
- O
known O
musician B-TER
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
. O

The O
commandant B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
Höss B-PER
, O
was O
musical B-TER
and O
set O
great O
store O
by O
the O
achievements O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

But O
up O
to O
then O
it O
had O
consisted O
only O
of O
female B-TER
violinists B-TER
and O
mandolinists B-TER
. O

Incorporating O
a O
cellist B-TER
therefore O
seemed O
to O
be O
extremely O
valuable O
. O

Actually O
newcomers O
had O
to O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
the O
quarantine O
block O
. O

But O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
that O
block O
were O
so O
unhygienic B-TER
that O
many O
of O
the O
newcomers O
were O
said O
to O
have O
died B-TER
there O
already O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
there O
too O
at O
first O
but O
they O
promised O
to O
get O
me O
out O
again O
on O
the O
following O
day O
so O
that O
I O
could O
start O
playing O
with O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
the O
next O
morning O
the O
commandant B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
brought O
me O
into O
the O
orchestra B-TER
barracks B-TER
, O
gave O
me O
a O
cello B-TER
with O
three O
strings O
and O
told O
me O
to O
play O
something O
for O
him O
. O

I O
had O
not O
played O
for O
years O
and O
therefore O
was O
completely O
out O
of O
practice O
. O

But O
the O
audience O
was O
satisfied O
and O
I O
immediately O
became O
a O
member O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

The O
conductor B-TER
, O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
, O
who O
herself O
was O
a O
violinist B-TER
, O
knew O
a O
lot O
about O
music B-TER
. O

Being O
very O
ambitious O
and O
energetic O
she O
succeeded O
in O
making O
the O
orchestra B-TER
perform O
at O
a O
high O
level O
. O

She O
very O
often O
rehearsed O
with O
us O
, O
set O
high O
standards O
to O
each O
of O
us O
individually O
, O
and O
was O
furious O
at O
every O
single O
wrong O
note B-TER
that O
was O
played O
. O

Our O
rehearsals O
lasted O
the O
whole O
day O
if O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
give O
a O
concert B-TER
, O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
that O
we O
were O
free O
from O
any O
other O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
programme O
consisted O
only O
of O
very O
light O
music B-TER
, O
marches B-TER
, O
waltzes B-TER
, O
folk B-TER
songs I-TER
, O
in O
particular O
those O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
the O
like O
. O

We O
also O
had O
to O
accompany O
singers B-TER
who O
had O
to O
present O
their O
skills O
. O

The O
orchestra B-TER
was O
active O
every O
morning O
, O
when O
the O
columns O
of O
workers B-TER
left O
for O
work B-TER
and O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
when O
they O
returned O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Moreover O
we O
had O
to O
play B-TER
on O
Sundays O
for O
the O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
or O
also O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
who O
were O
the O
camp B-TER
guards I-TER
. O

When O
in O
1944 O
thousands O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
were O
brought O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
were O
lining O
up O
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
we O
also O
had O
to O
play O
something O
for O
these O
ill O
- O
fated O
people B-TER
. O

Incidentally O
, O
we O
members O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
had O
a O
very O
special O
position O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
owed O
this O
mainly O
to O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
good O
- O
looking O
and O
elegant O
, O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
indispensable O
in O
her O
position O
and O
knew O
very O
well O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
. O

Thanks O
to O
her O
influence O
we O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
privileges O
. O

It O
is O
true O
we O
had O
to O
come O
to O
the O
general O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
every O
day O
, O
but O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
remain O
standing O
often O
for O
five O
hours O
. O

The O
food B-TER
that O
we O
received O
did O
not O
vary O
but O
sometimes O
we O
got O
more O
than O
the O
others O
. O

The O
rules O
for O
clothing B-TER
which O
were O
obligatory O
for O
the O
internees B-TER
did O
not O
apply O
to O
us O
so O
strictly O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
for O
our O
normal O
orchestral B-TER
performances O
they O
had O
white O
jackets B-TER
made O
to O
measure O
for O
us O
. O

Wearing B-TER
these O
we O
had O
to O
parade O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
show O
whenever O
the O
good O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
to O
be O
demonstrated O
to O
high O
- O
ranking O
SS B-TER
leaders B-TER
or O
other O
personages O
. O

Only O
in O
our O
block O
did O
Christians B-TER
and O
Jews O
live O
together O
. O

This O
caused O
all O
kinds O
of O
animosities O
as O
especially O
the O
Polish B-LOC
Christian B-TER
women B-TER
among O
us O
showed O
ineradicable O
hatred O
for O
the O
German B-LOC
Jews O
in O
particular O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
the O
important O
jobs B-TER
in O
the O
orchestra B-TER
were O
occupied O
by O
Jews O
added O
fuel O
to O
this O
hatred O
. O

Moreover O
, O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
actually O
got O
the O
parcels B-TER
which O
were O
occasionally O
sent O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

Usually O
the O
SS B-TER
kept O
these O
parcels B-TER
for O
themselves O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
self O
- O
government O
by O
the O
internees B-TER
had O
been O
introduced O
to O
a O
considerable O
degree O
. O

Each O
barracks B-TER
was O
subject O
to O
a O
block O
senior O
and O
each O
group O
of O
workers B-TER
to O
a O
Kapo B-TER
. O

These O
were O
appointed O
by O
the O
camp B-TER
management I-TER
and O
were O
responsible O
to O
them O
for O
all O
occurrences O
with O
those O
under O
their O
control O
. O

Those O
who O
got O
these O
jobs B-TER
were O
far O
from O
being O
the O
most O
positive O
elements O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
often O
suffered O
much O
more O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
those O
than O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Thefts O
, O
blackmail O
, O
maltreatment O
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
generally O
. O

Whoever O
had O
been O
clever O
enough O
to O
secure O
a O
job B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
or O
in O
a O
depot O
had O
a O
good O
life O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
general O
conditions B-TER
there O
. O

They O
used O
the O
stock O
that O
was O
entrusted O
to O
them O
for O
extensive O
bartering B-TER
. O

Objects O
for O
exchange B-TER
were O
above O
all O
food B-TER
, O
clothing B-TER
and O
cigarettes O
. O

Bartering B-TER
also O
flourished O
among O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
. O

I O
have O
often O
exchanged B-TER
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
some O
cigarettes O
. O

People B-TER
discovered O
while O
they O
were O
trading B-TER
were O
subject O
to O
punishment B-TER
. O

Sometimes O
this O
punishment B-TER
involved O
having O
to O
eat B-TER
these O
dozen O
cigarettes O
you O
had O
just O
bought O
. O

Meanwhile O
my O
sister O
had O
also O
been O
transferred B-TER
from O
gaol B-TER
to O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
not O
so O
lucky O
as O
I O
was O
and O
was O
put O
up O
in O
one O
of O
the O
ordinary O
barracks B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Here O
she O
had O
to O
work B-TER
very O
hard O
every O
day O
with O
the O
other O
inmates B-TER
, O
which O
among O
other O
things O
meant O
she O
had O
to O
transport O
very O
heavy O
stones O
. O

The O
hard O
work B-TER
together O
with O
insufficient O
food B-TER
and O
the O
unhygienic B-TER
conditions I-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
contributed O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
were O
many O
diseases B-TER
among O
the O
women B-TER
, O
which O
often O
became O
real O
epidemics B-TER
. O

It O
was O
especially O
scabies B-TER
and O
typhus B-TER
that O
spread O
widely O
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
patients O
had O
to O
parade O
in O
front O
of O
a O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
. O

Whoever O
no O
longer O
seemed O
to O
be O
strong O
enough O
was O
inevitably O
sent O
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

I O
and O
also O
my O
sister O
caught O
typhus B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
lying O
there O
almost O
unconscious O
a O
patients O
’ O
parade O
was O
taking O
place O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
SS B-TER
leader B-TER
Höss B-PER
was O
present O
who O
recognised O
me O
as O
the O
cellist B-TER
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
and O
gave O
the O
order B-TER
to O
leave O
me O
lying O
there O
. O

On O
the O
same O
occasion O
my O
sister O
had O
the O
presence O
of O
mind O
to O
explain O
that O
she O
was O
the O
cellist B-TER
’s I-TER
sister O
. O

That O
also O
saved O
her O
from O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

Sometime O
later O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
died B-TER
mysteriously O
. O

Meningitis B-TER
was O
declared O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
. O

But O
many O
thought O
the O
reason O
was O
poisoning O
. O

A O
Russian B-LOC
woman B-TER
now O
became O
the O
conductor B-TER
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
who O
however O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
music B-TER
. O

Not O
long O
after O
, O
in O
December O
1944 O
, O
the O
orchestra B-TER
was O
dissolved O
and O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Belsen B-LOC
. O

I O
later O
learnt O
that O
the O
primitive O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
to O
be O
concealed O
from O
the O
Allies B-TER
whose O
troops B-TER
were O
progressing O
rapidly O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
intended O
to O
demolish O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
where O
there O
were O
only O
( O
wooden O
) O
barracks B-TER
, O
which O
also O
included O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
to O
leave O
intact O
only O
the O
area O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
stone O
buildings O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
they O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
pulling O
down O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
which O
was O
also O
supposed O
to O
disappear O
completely O
– O
it O
had O
been O
built O
too O
solidly O
. O

The O
first O
sign O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
change O
for O
us O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
our O
orchestra B-TER
barracks B-TER
the O
Jews O
were O
separated O
from O
the O
Christians B-TER
. O

When O
we O
then O
received O
new O
clothes B-TER
we O
got O
the O
worst O
things O
. O

This O
was O
done O
because O
we O
as O
members O
of O
the O
group O
that O
had O
been O
privileged O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
so O
far O
had O
thus O
provoked O
the O
hatred O
and O
the O
jealousy O
of O
all O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
. O

Then O
we O
were O
checked O
by O
a O
doctor B-TER
and O
finally O
loaded O
into O
cattle B-TER
wagons I-TER
for O
Belsen B-LOC
. O

The O
Belsen B-LOC
camp I-LOC
was O
extremely O
primitive O
. O

There O
were O
only O
large O
tents B-TER
with O
room O
for O
about O
1,000 O
persons B-TER
and O
they O
were O
completely O
occupied O
. O

There O
were O
no O
lights O
nor O
any O
other O
comforts O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
into O
that O
room O
together O
with O
a O
further O
3,000 O
newcomers O
. O

The O
tents B-TER
were O
overcrowded O
to O
an O
incredible O
degree O
. O

If O
you O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet B-TER
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
force O
your O
way O
through O
the O
masses O
of O
people B-TER
to O
the O
tent B-TER
exit O
. O

After O
some O
days O
a O
whirlwind O
helped O
us O
, O
which O
tore O
down O
all O
the O
tents B-TER
and O
dropped O
them O
onto O
our O
heads O
. O

When O
the O
panic O
which O
had O
been O
caused O
by O
this O
event O
had O
calmed O
down O
we O
were O
standing O
throughout O
the O
night O
in O
the O
open O
air O
while O
the O
rain O
was O
pouring O
down O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
temporarily O
put O
up O
in O
SS B-TER
storerooms O
where O
we O
spent O
some O
time O
without O
any O
food B-TER
at O
all O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
were O
put O
up O
in O
barracks B-TER
where O
Russian B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
had O
been O
before O
. O

I O
think O
we O
were O
right O
in O
supposing O
that O
these O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
had O
simply O
been O
shot B-TER
to O
make O
room O
for O
us O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

Here O
we O
had O
at O
least O
electric O
light O
and O
occasionally O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
weaver O
’s O
shop O
to O
work B-TER
there O
. O

But O
there O
was O
extremely O
little O
food B-TER
and O
the O
diseases B-TER
among O
us O
, O
especially O
typhus B-TER
and O
jaundice B-TER
, O
increased O
. O

But O
there O
were O
not O
yet O
so O
many O
cases O
of O
death B-TER
at O
that O
time O
. O

From O
my O
sister O
, O
who O
had O
also O
come O
to O
Belsen B-LOC
and O
worked B-TER
as O
secretary O
in O
the O
SS B-TER
quarters O
, O
we O
received O
constant O
reports O
about O
the O
latest O
news O
of O
the O
day O
which O
in O
her O
position O
she O
was O
able O
to O
get O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
soon O
absolutely O
unbearable O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
the O
East O
, O
also O
with O
people B-TER
who O
had O
had O
to O
walk O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
and O
now O
were O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
keep O
on O
their O
feet O
. O

All O
these O
people B-TER
were O
crammed O
into O
the O
barracks B-TER
and O
it O
ended O
like O
this O
, O
namely O
people B-TER
were O
literally O
lying O
on O
each O
other O
and O
you O
had O
no O
chance O
at O
all O
to O
move O
. O

Then O
the O
food B-TER
was O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
more O
and O
more O
irregular O
. O

Then O
people B-TER
died B-TER
by O
the O
hundreds O
of O
malnutrition B-TER
. O

Only O
the O
strongest O
survived B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
saw O
cases O
of O
cannibalism O
also O
among O
the O
men O
. O

As O
a O
punishment O
one O
man B-TER
had O
to O
kneel O
for O
many O
hours O
, O
with O
a O
human O
ear O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O

I O
owe O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
held O
out O
to O
the O
end O
only O
to O
the O
circumstance O
that O
I O
had O
joined O
up O
with O
ten O
other O
women B-TER
who O
were O
former O
members O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

We O
had O
developed O
a O
certain O
routine O
, O
had O
a O
thorough O
wash B-TER
every O
day O
, O
helped O
each O
other O
with O
everything O
and O
encouraged O
each O
other O
. O

Soon O
there O
were O
more O
and O
more O
signs O
that O
we O
would O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
much O
longer O
for O
our O
liberation B-TER
. O

Again O
and O
again O
low O
- O
flying O
aircraft B-TER
of O
the O
Allies B-TER
flew O
over O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
dropping O
their O
bombs B-TER
very O
precisely O
only O
onto O
the O
SS B-TER
barracks B-TER
. O

For O
some O
days O
also O
the O
SS B-TER
sentry O
squads O
completely O
disappeared O
from O
the O
camp B-TER
but O
then O
came O
back O
again O
. O

The O
sentry O
squad O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
SS B-TER
men I-TER
who O
treated O
us O
especially O
fanatically O
. O

I O
learnt O
afterwards O
that O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
promised O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
to O
send O
them O
back O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
lines O
if O
they O
handed O
the O
camp B-TER
over O
intact O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
no O
idea O
how O
unbelievably O
dreadful O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
our O
camp B-TER
were O
. O

A O
few O
days O
before O
our O
liberation B-TER
the O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
had O
not O
received O
their O
bread B-TER
rations I-TER
because O
of O
some O
incident O
. O

After O
that O
, O
during O
the O
very O
last O
days O
, O
there O
was O
no O
food B-TER
at O
all O
. O

We O
survivors B-TER
had O
wasted O
away O
to O
skin O
and O
bone O
and O
were O
so O
weak O
that O
we O
were O
hardly O
able O
to O
move O
. O

Around O
us O
the O
numbers O
of O
dead B-TER
kept O
growing O
. O

That O
was O
the O
picture O
that O
presented O
itself O
to O
the O
English B-LOC
troops B-TER
when O
at O
last O
they O
occupied O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
15 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
sentry O
squad O
had O
waited O
calmly O
for O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
English B-LOC
, O
obviously O
relying O
on O
the O
promise O
that O
nothing O
would O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

Also O
the O
camp B-TER
commandant B-TER
Kramer B-PER
was O
still O
there O
. O

I O
saw O
him O
sitting O
calmly O
and O
peacefully O
on O
an O
English B-LOC
tank O
and O
guiding O
the O
English B-LOC
officers B-TER
through O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
after O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
discovered O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
the O
promise O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
valid O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
were O
immediately O
called O
to O
fetch O
the O
thousands O
of O
corpses B-TER
from O
the O
barracks B-TER
and O
bury B-TER
them O
. O

We O
survivors B-TER
were O
taken O
good O
care O
of O
by O
the O

The O
experiences O
of O
a O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish O
woman B-TER
in O
1944 O
. O

The O
19 O
th O
of O
March O
1944 O
was O
a O
black O
day O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

On O
this O
day O
, O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
occupied B-TER
the O
country O
and O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
section O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
infamous O
Commissioner O
Eichmann B-PER
, O
set O
up O
their O
quarters O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
a O
tragedy O
began O
which O
ended O
with O
the O
destruction B-TER
of O
a O
major O
part O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewry O
and O
the O
devastation O
of O
my O
beautiful O
country O
. O

A O
lot O
has O
been O
written O
and O
reported O
about O
the O
historical O
events O
of O
this O
woeful O
time O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
I O
want O
to O
give O
an O
account O
about O
my O
experiences O
as O
a O
woman B-TER
, O
and O
with O
it O
, O
give O
an O
excerpt O
from O
the O
life O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish O
women B-TER
in O
the O
fateful O
year O
of O
1944 O
. O

The O
day O
mentioned O
was O
a O
Sunday O
. O

We O
woke O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
as O
usual O
, O
a O
little O
later O
than O
on O
week O
days O
. O

Nothing O
indicated O
that O
this O
day O
would O
have O
any O
special O
importance O
. O

Even O
the O
newspapers B-TER
presented O
nothing O
special O
– O
the O
usual O
news O
and O
reports O
from O
the O
war B-TER
zones I-TER
– O
which O
we O
were O
used O
to O
. O

But O
about O
11 O
o’clock O
our O
neighbour O
knocked O
on O
the O
door O
, O
and O
asked O
with O
a O
face O
bathed O
in O
shock O
, O
if O
we O
had O
heard O
anything O
. O

It O
was O
said O
in O
the O
city O
that O
the O
German B-LOC
military B-TER
had O
marched O
in O
and O
that O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
had O
abdicated O
. O

We O
had O
no O
idea O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
had O
marched O
in O
and O
through O
Hungary B-LOC
happened O
several O
times O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
war B-TER
years O
, O
and O
did O
not O
appear O
as O
remarkable O
because O
Hungary B-LOC
was O
one O
of O
the O
belligerent O
countries O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich B-TER
and O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Important O
connections O
to O
Romania B-LOC
, O
to O
Russia B-LOC
and O
to O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
led O
through O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

But O
up O
until O
now O
, O
they O
had O
not O
interfered O
in O
the O
inner O
affairs O
. O

What O
pro B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
and O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measures I-TER
that O
had O
occurred O
so O
far O
were O
the O
result O
of O
diplomatic B-TER
pressure O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
not O
military B-TER
intervention B-TER
. O

It O
had O
been O
painful O
and O
had O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
worry O
and O
sadness O
to O
many O
Jewish O
families B-TER
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
had O
not O
been O
affected O
up O
till O
now O
. O

The O
fundamentals O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewry O
, O
even O
if O
a O
bit O
shaken O
in O
their O
economic B-TER
positions O
, O
were O
still O
intact O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
the O
rough O
outlines O
, O
you O
could O
say O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
now O
stood O
about O
where O
that O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
Jewry O
stood O
around O
the O
years O
1936 O
and O
1937 O
, O
with O
one O
big O
difference O
, O
that O
in O
view O
of O
the O
events O
in O
the O
war B-TER
zones I-TER
, O
the O
twilight O
of O
the O
Nazis O
tin O
Gods O
was O
already O
evident O
, O
and O
with O
It O
, O
now O
in O
the O
early O
spring O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
optimism O
of O
the O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
had O
a O
semblance O
of O
justification O
. O

However O
, O
now O
lightning O
struck O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
it O
became O
obvious O
that O
a O
catastrophe O
of O
huge O
proportions O
was O
unfolding O
, O
or O
was O
at O
least O
in O
its O
early O
stages O
, O
to O
be O
more O
accurate O
. O

Large O
numbers O
of O
Germans B-LOC
in O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
and O
SS B-ORG
uniforms B-TER
appeared O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

German B-LOC
cars O
sped O
through O
the O
city O
. O

A O
big O
hotel B-TER
, O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
, O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
staff O
and O
German B-LOC
sentries O
stood O
there O
on O
guard O
. O

The O
editorial O
buildings O
of O
the O
left O
leaning O
newspapers B-TER
were O
occupied O
and O
a O
team O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
appeared O
in O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Community I-ORG
of O
Budapest B-LOC
. O

Like O
an O
awful O
nightmare O
, O
terror O
settled O
over O
the O
entire O
country O
. O

For O
women B-TER
like O
us O
, O
it O
was O
especially O
bad O
and O
we O
hardly O
dared O
to O
go O
out O
onto O
the O
streets O
in O
order O
to O
make O
even O
the O
most O
essential O
purchases O
. O

Of O
the O
edicts B-TER
and O
measures B-TER
, O
which O
in O
the O
next O
days O
and O
weeks O
like O
a O
torrent O
rained O
down O
over O
the O
Jews O
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
and O
the O
most O
obvious O
to O
the O
eye O
was O
the O
order B-TER
to O
wear O
the O
star B-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
. O

It O
came O
into O
force O
on O
the O
4th O
of O
April O
. O

It O
was O
exactly O
prescribed O
, O
which O
shape O
the O
star B-TER
must O
have O
, O
which O
material O
and O
in O
which O
colour O
it O
was O
to O
be O
made O
, O
and O
where O
it O
must O
be O
worn O
. O

We O
women B-TER
acquired O
the O
task O
of O
making O
the O
star B-TER
for O
the O
whole O
family B-TER
out O
of O
yellow O
material O
. O

Soon O
no O
suitable O
yellow O
material O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
entire O
city O
. O

Later O
the O
stars B-TER
were O
mass O
produced O
. O

It O
was O
a O
dangerous O
thing O
to O
deviate O
the O
star B-TER
even O
in O
the O
smallest O
way O
from O
the O
prescribed O
form O
because O
anyone O
who O
did O
not O
wear O
it O
exactly O
according O
to O
the O
regulations B-TER
was O
immediately O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
criminal B-TER
officials B-TER
who O
prowled O
the O
streets O
at O
the O
behest O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

Besides O
the O
legal O
measures B-TER
, O
a O
whole O
host O
of O
lone O
actions O
occurred O
which O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
in O
their O
hatred O
of O
the O
Jews O
did O
in O
their O
free O
time O
for O
their O
private O
pleasure O
. O

Scavenging O
in O
the O
individual O
apartments B-TER
of O
houses B-TER
rented O
by O
Jews O
, O
in O
order O
to O
confiscate O
there O
valuable O
radios B-TER
, O
cameras O
or O
jewellery O
, O
became O
a O
favourite O
sport O
. O

The O
leaders O
and O
interpreters O
for O
these O
actions O
were O
mainly O
the O
numerous O
ethnic O
Germans B-LOC
elements O
settled O
in O
Hungary B-TER
who O
now O
naturally O
felt O
in O
their O
element O
and O
who O
constituted O
the O
liaison O
officers O
between O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
authorities O
. O

They O
found O
out O
from O
the O
caretakers O
of O
the O
individual O
houses B-TER
the O
names O
of O
the O
Jewish O
tenants O
and O
then O
went O
together O
with O
the O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
from O
apartment B-TER
to O
apartment B-TER
. O

A O
group O
of O
four O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
also O
appeared O
at O
our O
door O
in O
the O
early O
days O
of O
April O
. O

They O
forced O
their O
way O
into O
our O
flat B-TER
and O
searched O
the O
room O
for O
radios B-TER
because O
, O
as O
they O
said O
, O
every O
Jew O
listens O
to O
enemy O
radio O
broadcasts O
. O

We O
showed O
them O
and O
old O
model B-TER
, O
and O
because O
my O
husband O
explained O
to O
them O
in O
fluent O
German B-LOC
that O
it O
was O
actually O
not O
possible O
with O
this O
old O
box O
to O
be O
able O
to O
receive O
foreign O
stations B-TER
, O
they O
were O
a O
little O
confused O
and O
finally O
withdrew O
although O
not O
without O
having O
uttered O
ugly O
threats O
. O

They O
then O
went O
through O
the O
remaining O
Jewish O
apartments B-TER
in O
the O
block O
and O
their O
activities O
were O
finally O
stopped O
when O
a O
highly O
ranked O
Hungarian B-LOC
officer B-TER
appeared O
in O
the O
picture O
whom O
a O
Christian B-TER
neighbour O
had O
speedily O
sent O
for O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-LOC
officer B-TER
appeared O
indignant O
about O
the O
individual O
actions O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
though O
, O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
too O
predisposed O
to O
be O
taken O
the O
Jews O
under O
his O
protection O
. O

However O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
uniform B-TER
was O
sufficient O
to O
cause O
the O
Germans B-LOC
to O
leave O
the O
house B-TER
. O

In O
the O
adjoining O
house B-TER
where O
they O
went O
after O
, O
they O
had O
more O
luck O
and O
left O
heavily O
laden O
with O
booty O
. O

A O
similar O
group O
of O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
appeared O
a O
few O
days O
later O
at O
my O
parent O
’s O
apartment B-TER
a O
few O
streets O
away O
from O
us O
. O

Also O
there O
they O
were O
looking O
for O
spoils O
. O

They O
took O
some O
valuable O
objects O
with O
them O
. O

However O
, O
what O
was O
worse O
than O
this O
was O
that O
my O
mother O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
threats O
and O
aggressive O
appearance O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
suffered O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
and O
was O
bed O
- O
ridden O
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

These O
days O
were O
full O
of O
worries B-TER
and O
cares O
. O

We O
continually O
heard O
that O
people B-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
and O
interned O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jews O
from O
all O
of O
the O
provincial O
cities O
had O
been O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
and O
deported B-TER
. O

I O
had O
many O
relatives B-TER
in O
the O
provinces O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
taken O
away O
to O
German B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
and O
only O
a O
few O
of O
them O
returned O
later O
. O

The O
majority O
fell O
victims B-TER
to O
the O
Nazi O
terror O
. O

In O
May O
, O
my O
husband O
was O
conscripted O
for O
work B-TER
service O
. O

That O
was O
a O
hard O
blow O
for O
us O
all O
. O

We O
knew O
from O
the O
experience O
of O
earlier O
years O
that O
the O
treatment O
and O
provisions O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
work B-TER
service I-TER
had O
always O
been O
bad O
, O
and O
this O
time O
it O
was O
expected O
to O
be O
even O
worse O
. O

And O
equally O
, O
the O
worst O
was O
expected O
for O
those O
defenceless O
family B-TER
members O
left O
behind O
. O

The O
news O
had O
already O
come O
from O
the O
provinces O
that O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
in O
full O
flow O
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
be O
only O
a O
question O
of O
time O
before O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
in O
Budapest B-LOC
would O
come O
. O

Meanwhile O
a O
torrent O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
orders I-TER
and I-TER
decrees I-TER
hailed O
down O
upon O
us O
: O
the O
blocking O
of O
bank B-TER
balances I-TER
; O
the O
confiscation B-TER
of O
radios B-TER
and O
objects O
of O
value O
; O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
food B-TER
rations I-TER
; O
a O
travel B-TER
ban I-TER
and O
so O
on O
. O

Every O
week O
brought O
a O
new O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measure I-TER
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
be O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
plan O
of O
the O
authorities B-TER
, O
that O
exactly O
now O
that O
they O
had O
robbed O
Jewish O
families B-TER
of O
their O
men O
through O
conscription B-TER
for I-TER
work I-TER
duty I-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
, O
old O
people B-TER
and O
children B-TER
could O
be O
exposed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
it O
firstly O
to O
the O
terror O
of O
the O
orders B-TER
of O
the O
authorities B-TER
and O
later O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
deportation B-TER
without O
any O
defence B-TER
. O

Through O
the O
splitting O
apart O
of O
the O
family B-TER
members O
, O
the O
problems O
of O
existence O
became O
almost O
unsolvable O
. O

You O
could O
no O
longer O
think O
about O
any O
regulated O
acquisition O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

You O
had O
to O
sell O
everything O
that O
was O
superfluous O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
compete O
for O
the O
extremely O
restricted B-TER
means O
of O
subsistence O
. O

Those O
amongst O
our O
co O
- O
religionists O
who O
were O
completely O
penniless O
were O
dependent O
upon O
the O
support B-TER
of O
the O
community O
. O

Families B-TER
helped O
out O
one O
another O
. O

A O
long O
period O
of O
want O
and O
going O
without O
began O
, O
and O
it O
always O
got O
worse O
until O
it O
finally O
increased O
to O
unbearable O
hunger O
pangs O
. O

So O
long O
as O
my O
husband O
in O
the O
first O
weeks O
of O
work B-TER
conscription O
was O
stationed O
in O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
near O
the O
capital O
city O
, O
he O
was O
able O
occasionally O
with O
a O
fake O
, O
leave O
chit O
or O
because O
of O
a O
simulated O
illness B-TER
to O
come O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
be O
helpful O
to O
us O
with O
the O
forced O
rehousing B-TER
from O
our O
apartment B-TER
and O
into O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
in O
the O
following O
June O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
time O
, O
these O
occasions O
became O
more O
difficult O
and O
more O
infrequent O
and O
we O
had O
to O
look O
for O
other O
ways O
and O
means O
, O
to O
keep O
in O
contact O
. O

You O
could O
not O
rely O
on O
the O
post O
. O

There O
were O
though O
in O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
and O
later O
in O
more O
distant O
garrisons O
some O
farm O
labourers B-TER
who O
were O
ready O
for O
money O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
flattery O
to O
deliver O
letters B-TER
, O
small O
packages O
, O
news O
and O
so O
on O
. O

It O
became O
a O
regular O
and O
organised O
shuttle O
service O
. O

These O
half O
grown O
lads O
, O
who O
went O
several O
times O
a O
week O
, O
from O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
to O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
back O
in O
order O
to O
convey O
mail B-TER
and O
messages O
from O
a O
company O
of O
those O
in O
work B-TER
service I-TER
to O
their O
wives O
and O
parents O
in O
the O
house B-TER
for O
Jews O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
the O
same O
back O
, O
gradually O
became O
a O
veritable O
plague O
. O

As O
they O
became O
conscious O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
their O
role O
on O
the O
one O
side O
and O
the O
helplessness O
of O
the O
Jews O
on O
the O
other O
, O
their O
insolence O
and O
greediness O
grew O
. O

They O
demanded O
ever O
bigger O
sums O
of O
money B-TER
for O
their O
message O
service O
, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
blackmailed O
in O
shameless O
ways O
and O
even O
indulged O
themselves O
physical O
effronteries O
against O
the O
defenceless O
Jewish O
women B-TER
to O
whom O
they O
delivered O
the O
messages O
. O

Every O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
in O
a O
house O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
kept O
in O
contact O
with O
their O
husband O
in O
this O
way O
complained O
about O
it O
and O
it O
became O
from O
day O
to O
day O
and O
from O
week O
to O
week O
more O
apparent O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
completely O
and O
without O
legal O
recourse O
, O
exposed O
to O
such O
attacks B-TER
and O
extortions B-TER
. O

The O
days O
of O
the O
forced O
resettlement O
from O
the O
existing O
apartments B-TER
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
houses O
( O
middle O
of O
June O
) O
brought O
the O
hardest O
tasks O
. O

The O
most O
common O
furnishings O
and O
household B-TER
effects O
had O
to O
be O
in O
any O
case O
left O
behind O
. O

However O
, O
even O
the O
transportation B-TER
of O
the O
most O
indispensable O
items O
hit O
huge O
difficulties O
because O
inside O
a O
few O
days O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
people B-TER
had O
to O
resettle O
. O

So O
it O
was O
as O
good O
as O
impossible O
to O
find O
vehicles O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
you O
had O
to O
carry O
the O
possessions O
and O
parcels O
yourself O
. O

Anyone O
who O
was O
able O
to O
find O
a O
hand O
- O
cart O
, O
a O
pram O
or O
something O
similar O
could O
consider O
themselves O
lucky O
. O

You O
saw O
on O
the O
streets O
from O
early O
morning O
till O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
women B-TER
, O
old O
people B-TER
and O
children B-TER
struggling O
along O
heavily O
laden O
in O
the O
sweltering O
summer O
heat O
. O

In O
the O
new O
accommodation B-TER
, O
which O
were O
all O
overfilled O
with O
people B-TER
, O
right O
from O
the O
first O
day O
there O
was O
irritation O
with O
the O
other O
tenants O
, O
with O
the O
caretakers O
and O
with O
the O
neighbours O
. O

We O
believed O
we O
had O
arrived O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
hell O
when O
we O
experienced O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
which O
several O
families B-TER
had O
to O
share O
an O
apartment B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
all O
of O
this O
became O
steadily O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O

In O
these O
days O
on O
average O
we O
were O
six O
people B-TER
to O
a O
room B-TER
, O
and O
later O
this O
went O
so O
far O
that O
there O
were O
up O
to O
twenty O
people B-TER
residing O
in O
a O
space O
. O

The O
unlucky O
people B-TER
who O
came O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
last O
of O
all O
, O
were O
so O
cramped O
together O
that O
they O
could O
not O
even O
sleep O
stretched O
out O
, O
but O
had O
to O
survive O
the O
time O
of O
the O
siege B-TER
and O
the O
street O
battles B-TER
of O
Budapest B-LOC
sitting O
on O
chairs O
or O
squatting O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

Another O
evil O
, O
which O
brought O
the O
women B-TER
to O
despair O
, O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
houses O
for O
the O
Jews O
between O
11 O
o’clock O
on O
the O
morning O
and O
5 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

( O
Later O
this O
time O
span O
was O
even O
shortened O
) O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
daily O
purchasing O
of O
the O
most O
necessary O
provisions O
became O
a O
recurring O
agony O
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
the O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
for O
the O
general O
population B-TER
was O
becoming O
ever O
worse O
the O
nearer O
the O
front O
came O
. O

The O
food B-TER
which O
came O
to O
the O
market O
and O
the O
few O
businesses B-TER
which O
were O
still O
open O
was O
mostly O
sold O
out O
in O
the O
early O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
. O

When O
the O
Jews O
appeared O
at O
the O
market O
after O
11 O
o’clock O
, O
they O
had O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
was O
left O
. O

The O
doors O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
houses I-TER
were O
barely O
opened O
when O
the O
women B-TER
, O
armed O
with O
their O
shopping O
bags O
and O
nets O
, O
tumbled O
out O
and O
hurried O
along O
the O
streets O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ferret O
out O
something O
edible B-TER
. O

The O
hunt O
went O
from O
one O
shop O
to O
the O
other O
, O
in O
some O
in O
which O
you O
had O
to O
stand O
perhaps O
for O
hours O
, O
or O
in O
others O
in O
which O
there O
was O
a O
regular O
scuffle O
about O
some O
stocks O
. O

Many O
shops O
closed O
at O
midday O
and O
then O
the O
chase O
continued O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
flourished O
and O
the O
shop O
keepers O
had O
some O
things O
hidden O
under O
the O
counter O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
, O
most O
of O
us O
were O
deeply O
miserable O
and O
could O
not O
afford O
the O
expensive O
additional O
charge O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
each O
new O
day O
brought O
new O
cares O
and O
new O
worries O
. O

I O
lived O
the O
house B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
together O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
other O
relatives O
. O

One O
day O
, O
it O
was O
probably O
in O
July O
or O
August O
, O
my O
father O
, O
who O
at O
that O
time O
was O
in O
his O
seventies O
, O
was O
helping O
me O
with O
the O
shopping O
in O
a O
grocery B-TER
store O
. O

There O
was O
a O
big O
crowd O
in O
the O
shop O
and O
suddenly O
a O
soda B-TER
water I-TER
bottle O
either O
burst O
or O
exploded O
. O

It O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
determine O
exactly O
which O
. O

The O
pieces O
injured B-TER
my O
father O
in O
the O
right O
hand O
and O
penetrated O
deep O
into O
the O
flesh O
. O

The O
blood O
was O
streaming O
out O
, O
and O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
the O
injury B-TER
appeared O
to O
be O
worse O
than O
happily O
it O
later O
transpired O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
was O
no O
doctor B-TER
anywhere O
or O
even O
a O
dressing B-TER
to O
get O
hold O
of O
. O

Several O
householders O
, O
who O
perhaps O
could O
have O
helped O
, O
refused O
any O
help B-TER
to O
the O
old O
man B-TER
with O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
. O

Even O
the O
shop O
- O
keeper O
himself O
did O
not O
want O
to O
create O
trouble O
and O
edged O
him O
out O
of O
the O
door O
. O

The O
nearest O
hospital B-TER
was O
at O
least O
a O
half O
an O
hour O
away O
. O

A O
journey O
by O
car O
was O
prohibited O
to O
all O
Jews O
, O
through O
a O
decree B-TER
which O
was O
enacted O
shortly O
before O
. O

No O
taxi O
or O
vehicle O
would O
take O
the O
injured B-TER
man B-TER
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
a O
cyclist O
, O
who O
came O
our O
way O
, O
took O
pity O
and O
invited O
my O
father O
onto O
a O
three O
- O
wheeler O
which O
was O
designed O
for O
transporting B-TER
wares O
. O

My O
injured O
father O
arrived O
in O
this O
way O
with O
a O
considerable O
loss B-TER
of I-TER
blood I-TER
at O
the O
hospital B-TER
where O
at O
last O
first B-TER
aid I-TER
was O
given O
. O

He O
carried O
his O
arm O
in O
a O
sling O
for O
a O
month O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
of O
August O
, O
one O
day O
the O
rumour O
spread O
like O
lightning O
, O
that O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
of O
Budapest B-LOC
was O
imminent O
. O

The O
tension O
was O
high O
. O

Actually O
, O
an O
action O
of O
this O
sort O
was O
planned O
and O
the O
city O
swarmed O
with O
German B-LOC
SS B-ORG
and O
Hungarian B-LOC
gendarmes B-TER
. O

The O
action O
was O
cancelled O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
although O
we O
only O
learned O
the O
details O
much O
later O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
of O
Budapest B-LOC
stood O
at O
this O
time O
ready O
with O
a O
little O
bundle O
to O
march O
to O
the O
station O
and O
get O
into O
the O
waggons B-TER
. O

The O
essentials O
were O
snatched O
up O
and O
knotted O
in O
the O
bundle O
– O
some O
change O
of O
clothing B-TER
, O
some O
food B-TER
, O
soap B-TER
and O
comb O
, O
the O
most O
important O
documents B-TER
and O
keepsakes O
, O
and O
everything O
was O
tucked O
away O
close O
at O
hand O
beside O
the O
couch O
. O

This O
bundle O
never O
left O
us O
for O
many O
weeks O
and O
months O
. O

It O
became O
a O
visible O
sign O
of O
our O
Jewish O
fate O
. O

Every O
single O
Jew O
in O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
had O
it O
constantly O
by O
them O
. O

Everyone O
was O
ready O
to O
go O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Each O
of O
us O
lived O
in O
the O
constant O
fear B-TER
of O
being O
hauled O
out O
of O
the O
hell O
of O
the O
houses B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
and O
into O
a O
more O
frightful O
inferno O
. O

To O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
exceptions O
, O
they O
proved O
their O
character O
even O
in O
that O
terrible O
period O
. O

This O
showed O
itself O
in O
the O
mutual O
helpfulness B-TER
, O
which O
the O
individual O
families B-TER
showed O
to O
each O
other O
and O
in O
the O
assistance O
given O
by O
the O
better O
placed O
to O
the O
poorer O
people B-TER
. O

To O
cite O
another O
significant O
example O
… O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
the O
rumour O
was O
spread O
that O
those O
Jews O
who O
were O
prepared O
to O
be O
christened B-TER
would O
avoid O
the O
impending O
threat O
of O
deportation B-TER
. O

Although O
both O
the O
catholic B-TER
and O
protestant B-TER
clergy B-TER
were O
willing O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
christening B-TER
in O
a O
shortened O
procedure O
, O
only O
a O
relatively O
few O
Jews O
chose O
this O
supposed O
way O
out O
. O

Despite O
the O
immensity O
of O
the O
danger O
, O
for O
the O
predominant O
and O
large O
majority O
such O
ideas O
were O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
rumour O
transpired O
to O
be O
completely O
unfounded O
. O

In O
all O
of O
the O
measures O
and O
excesses O
which O
followed O
, O
no O
difference O
was O
made O
between O
religious B-TER
Jews O
and O
Jews B-TER
by I-TER
race I-TER
. O

After O
the O
15th O
of O
October O
1945 O
, O
that O
day O
which O
passed O
off O
tragically O
, O
on O
which O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Regent O
Horthy B-PER
undertook O
a O
failed O
attempt O
to O
leave O
the O
coalition O
of O
axis B-TER
powers O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
the O
terror O
against O
the O
Jews O
was O
yet O
more O
increased O
. O

The O
time O
allowed O
for O
leaving O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
shortened O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
go O
out O
much O
at O
all O
because O
you O
ran O
the O
danger O
to O
be O
seized B-TER
and O
kidnapped B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
by O
the O
hordes O
of O

In O
fear B-TER

we O
sat O
in O
our O

Compassionate O
people B-TER
from O

us O

also O
passed O
amongst O
their O
numerous O
terror O
laws B-TER
in O
these O
days O
a O
decree B-TER
which O
proclaimed O
the O
conscription O
of O
all O
Jewish O
women B-TER
under O
45 O
for O
work B-TER
service I-TER
. O

After O
the O
men B-TER
, O
now O
it O
was O
also O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
Jewish O
women B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
from O
the O
area O
in O
which O
I O
lived O
, O
were O
supposed O
to O
present O
themselves O
on O
a O
certain O
day O
in O
Tattershall B-LOC
near O
the O
Eastern O
railway B-TER
station O
. O

Because O
the O
disorganisation O
in O
the O
country O
was O
already O
widely O
advanced O
and O
in O
all O
the O
areas O
of O
administration B-TER
a O
lot O
of O
panic O
, O
if O

prevailed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
mention O
of O
a O

using O

or O

. O

Therefore O
many O
Jewish O
women B-TER
, O
including O
myself O
, O
simply O
ignored O
this O
conscription B-TER
decree B-TER
. O

We O
were O
fully O
conscious O
that O
as O
a O
result O
we O
were O
venturing O
a O
very O
dangerous O
step O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
saw O
even O
greater O
danger O
in O
carrying O
out O
the O
conscription B-TER
order B-TER
. O

Once O

you O
could O
be O

The O
houses O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
indeed O
a O
hell O
and O
a O
constant O
repository O
of O
insecurity O
, O
but O
under O
the O
present O
circumstances O
, O
it O
was O
still O
relatively O
more O
secure O
than O
the O
streets O
, O
or O
Tattershall B-LOC
or O
any O
other O
place O
in O
the O
outside O

. O

The O
period O
that O
followed O
showed O
that O
this O
consideration O
was O
correct O
. O

Of O
the O
women B-TER
and O
young O
girls O
who O
went O
to O
Tattershall B-LOC
almost O
all O
were O
assigned O
to O
forced B-TER

on O
the O

or O
were O
deported B-TER
to O
German B-LOC
concentration B-TER

. O

Very O
few O
actually O
returned O
. O

On O
the O
27th O
of O
October O
, O
my O
husband O
arrived O
at O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
coming O
via O
secret O
paths O
. O

He O
had O
detached O
himself O
from O
the O
work B-TER
group O
, O
and O
similarly O
, O
had O
seen O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
as O
relatively O
the O
safest O
spot O
. O

However O
, O
we O
were O
both O
clear O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
as O
good O
as O
illegal O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
from O
these O
days O
until O
the O
middle O
of O
January O
when O
the O
Russians B-LOC
entered O
, O
we O
led O
the O
live O
of O
a O
hunted O
beast O
. O

We O
acquired O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
, O
amongst O
which O
was O
a O
certificate O
from O
a O
doctor B-TER
with O
famous O
name O
, O
attesting O
that O
my O
husband O
had O
a O
serious O
heart B-TER
problem O
. O

That O
helped O
us O
over O
the O

One O
such O
raid O
arrived O
at O
our O
house B-TER
on O
the O

few O
days O
of O
November O
. O

Several O

of O

age O
were O
randomly O
lead O
away O
and O
even O
some O

When O
an O
Arrow B-ORG

man B-TER
entered O
our O

I O
was O
able O
on O
the O

my O

with O

my O

to O
induce O
him O
to O
leave O

However O
, O
our O
stay O
in O
this O
house B-TER
was O
at O
an O
end O
. O

We O
were O
clear O
about O
that O
. O

We O
acquired O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Schutzpässe O

protection O

which O
at O
this O
time O
were O
given O
out O

in O

Where O
we O
had O
in O

6 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
room B-TER
, O
now O
, O
in O
our O
new O
accommodation B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
share O
with O
12 O
people B-TER
to O
a O
room B-TER
. O

However O
, O
we O
could O
not O
even O
remain O
there O
long O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
November O
, O
we O
were O
hauled O
out O
in O
a O

and O
our O

declared O
invalid O
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
a O

along O
with O
many O
others O
. O

We O
succeeded O
on O
the O
way O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

We O
wondered O
around O
for O
several O
days O

and O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
here O
and O
there O
with O
non O

Again O
we O
were O
apprehended B-TER

and O
again O
we O
fled B-TER

until O
finally O
we O
found O
shelter B-TER
in O
a O
clinic B-TER
where O
we O
had O
to O
conduct O
ourselves O
in O
devious O
ways O
: O
once O
we O
had O
to O
project O
ourselves O
as O
non O

Jews O
and O
another O
time O
we O
had O
to O
simulate O
being O
ill B-TER

Of O
course O
, O
we O
had O

off O
and O
thrown O
away O
our O
yellow B-TER

at O
the O
time O
of O
our O

It O
was O
not O

to O

the O

with O

, O
who O
hung O
about O
and O
roamed O
around O

, O
and O
stopped O
people B-TER
who O
looked O
suspicious O
. O

In O
order O
to O
give O
myself O
courage O
and O
to O
appear O
as O
unconcerned O
as O
possible O
, O
I O
cultivated O
in O
such O
circumstances O
a O
cheerful O

, O
humming O
and O
going O
along O
the O
street O
with O
a O

, O
whilst O
in O
reality O
my O
heart O
was O
beating O
furiously O
with O

I O
had O
to O
muster O
a O
special O
courage O
and O
endurance O
when O
I O
was O
separated O
from O
my O

after O
our O

and O
was O
brought O

Teleki O

where O
nothing O
but O
Jewish O

were O
under O

guard O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
showed O
my O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
and O
claimed O
that O
I O
was O
a O
refugee B-TER
from O
the O
provinces O
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
by O
mistake O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Arrow B-ORG

members O
knew O
that O
many O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
were O
in O
circulation O
and O
rejected O
me O
brusquely O
. O

However O
, O
I O
did O
not O
allow O
myself O
to O
be O
intimidated O
and O
demanded O
once O
again O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O

Rejected O
ten O
times O
, O
I O
did O
not O

away O
from O
the O

of O
the O

where O
the O

were O
who O
it O
was O
known O
were O
not O

as O

After O
waiting O
for O
hours O
– O
hungry B-TER
, O
cold O
and O
completely O
exhausted O
– O
I O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
in O
front O
of O
an O
investigating B-TER
police B-TER
officer O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
gathered O
a O
lot O
of O
energy O
and O
I O
protested O
against O
our O
arrest B-TER
to O
him O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
me O
; O
he O
looked O
at O
my O
papers B-TER
; O
and O
he O
knew O
without O
doubt O
the O
correct O
decision O
. O

But O
he O
was O
well O
- O
meaning O
. O

He O
arranged O
for O
my O
immediate O
release B-TER
and O
gave O
me O
two O
officers O
with O
whom O
I O
then O
went O
to O
a O
neighbouring O
house O
for O
arrested B-TER
Jewish O
men B-TER
to O
fetch O
my O
husband O
. O

We O
had O
already O
been O
separated O
from O
my O
parents O
when O
we O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
Schutzhaus O
. O

They O
were O
lined O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
older O
people B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
a O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
learned O
that O
later O
and O
were O
able O
to O
find O
out O
their O
exact O
address O
through O
news O
smuggled B-TER
out I-TER
. O

Although O
we O
ourselves O
were O
harassed O
, O
we O
maintained O
contact O
with O
them O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
some O
non O
- O
Jewish O
friends O
, O
who O
were O
daring O
and O
prepared O
to O
make O
sacrifices O
said O
they O
were O
prepared O
to O
deliver O
messages O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

An O
attempt O
to O
smuggle B-TER
in O
food B-TER
parcels O
failed O
though O
. O

However O
, O
a O
good O
friend O
at O
least O
brought O
out O
a O
letter B-TER
and O
was O
able O
to O
speak O
to O
my O
parents O
personally O
. O

It O
was O
the O
last O
greeting O
he O
brought O
back O
to O

from O
my O

. O

The O
poor O
thing O
died B-TER
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
18th O
of O
January O
1945 O
of O
hunger B-TER
and O
exhaustion O
. O

I O
also O
have O
to O
relate O
about O
the O
sad O
aftermath O
that O
was O
linked O
to O
this O
tragic O
event O
. O

In O
the O
clinic B-TER
where O
we O
had O
been O
hiding B-TER
ourselves O
, O
and O
which O
had O
been O
freed B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-LOC
on O
the O
13th O
of O
January O
, O
we O
learned O
on O
the O
19th O
of O
January O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
been O
liberated B-TER
on O
the O
previous O
day O
. O

Immediately O
, O
we O
made O
our O
way O
through O
the O
city O
which O
was O
completely O
devastated B-TER
and O
lying O
in O
rubble O
. O

Half O
way O
there O
, O
amongst O
the O
ruins O
, O
we O
met O
my O
father O
who O
was O
looking B-TER
for I-TER
us O
. O

He O
was O
so O
completely O
exhausted O
and O
aged O
by O
decades O
that O
I O
scarcely O
recognised O
him O
. O

When O
he O
gave O
me O
the O
awful O
news O
, O
we O
collapsed O
together O
. O

It O
lasted O
a O
fairly O
long O
time O
until O
I O
was O
myself O
again O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
city O
the O
battle B-TER
raged O
on O
. O

Huge O
waves O
of O
fire O
flared O
up O
. O

There O
was O
no O
mention O
in O
this O
chaos O
of O
any O
kind O
of O
funeral B-TER
. O

The O
dead B-TER
lay O
in O
their O
thousands O
unburied B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
and O
between O
the O
ruins O
. O

My O
poor O
mother O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
the O
cellar O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
house B-TER
. O

I O
tried O
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
to O
find O
a O
coffin O
somewhere O
. O

My O
efforts O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

There O
was O
no O
coffin O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
large O
ruined O
city O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
made O
our O
way O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
the O
body B-TER
out O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
on O
a O
stretcher O
. O

Because O
the O
cemeteries B-TER
lay O
far O
outside O
of O
the O
city O
and O
were O
still O
under O
artillery B-TER
fire I-TER
, O
they O
were O
unreachable O
, O
therefore O
people B-TER
had O
begun O
in O
these O
days O
to O
bury B-TER
the O
dead B-TER
in O
situ O
in O
squares O
and O
in O
parks O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
do O
that O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
the O
clinic B-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
long O
way O
, O
and O
a O
deep O
covering O
of O
snow O
had O
spread O
itself O
over O
the O
rubble O
strewn O
streets O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
another O
man B-TER
, O
a O
caretaker O
, O
made O
their O
way O
with O
the O
stretcher O
. O

However O
, O
they O
were O
both O
so O
exhausted O
through O
under O
- O
nourishment O
that O
they O
did O
not O
come O
very O
far O
with O
their O
sad O
load O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
all O
of O
the O
destruction B-TER
and O
horror O
, O
children B-TER
played O
in O
a O
square O
with O
a O
toboggan O
. O

We O
borrowed O
it O
; O
put O
the O
body B-TER
on O
it O
; O
and O
pulled O
it O
through O
the O
snow O
and O
between O
the O
ruins O
to O
the O
clinic B-TER
. O

There O
, O
my O
mother O
was O
temporarily O
buried B-TER
beside O
all O
of O
the O
other O
who O
died B-TER
during O
the O
struggle B-TER
. O

The O
intention O
was O
to O
transfer O
her O
later O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
battle B-TER
in O
an O
orderly O
ceremony O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
, O
and O
there O
to O
lay O
her O
to O
rest O
in O
eternal O
peace O
. O

However O
, O
the O
situation O
happened O
differently O
. O

Because O
the O
lack O
of O
food B-TER
also O
continued O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
siege B-TER
, O
and O
we O
were O
both O
extremely O
exhausted O
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
provincial O
city O
of O
Szeged B-LOC
where O
the O
provisioning O
was O
better O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
was O
put O
in O
hospital B-TER
and O
slowly O
recovered O
his O
strength O
again O
. O

In O
the O
interim O
, O
the O
city O
administration B-TER
in O
Budapest B-LOC
began O
in O
March O
to O
exhume B-TER
those O
who O
were O
temporarily O
buried B-TER
during O
the O
siege B-TER
and O
transfer O
them O
to O
the O
central O
cemetery B-TER
. O

When O
we O
learnt O
that O
, O
we O
hurried O
to O
the O
clinic B-TER
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
but O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
. O

In O
a O
completely O
chaotic O
manner O
and O
without O
informing O
anyone O
, O
the O
exhumations B-TER
had O
begun O
precisely O
in O
this O
area O
, O
and O
all O
of O
my O
efforts O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
way O
to O
where O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
dead B-TER
were O
brought O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

We O
learned O
only O
that O
those O
exhumed B-TER
were O
buried B-TER
in O
a O
mass B-TER
grave I-TER
in O
the O
central O

of O
Budapest B-LOC

There O
is O
now O

about O
the O

who O
came O
to O
England B-LOC
from O
the O
European B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
in O
1945 O
. O

They O
arrived O
in O
different O
transports B-TER
, O
mainly O
of O
adolescents B-TER
. O

Most O
of O
these O
little O
ones O
came O
with O
the O
first O
group O
of O
300 O
children B-TER
and O
their O
first O
home B-TER
was O
the O
nursery O
of O
the O
big O
reception O
camp B-TER
in O
Windermere B-LOC
. O

Most O
were O
between O
three O
and O
five O
years O
old O
, O
with O
a O
few O
between O
six O
and O
seven O
. O

They O
were O
miserable O
little O
creatures O
, O
all O
of O
them O
well O
below O
the O
normal O
size O
for O
their O
age O
, O
and O
they O
were O
extremely O
irritable O
. O

The O
heads O
of O
many O
of O
them O
were O
shaven O
and O
covered O
with O
rashes B-TER
, O
and O
they O
suffered O
from O
all O
kinds O
of O
skin B-TER
diseases I-TER
. O

At O
first O
, O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
house B-TER
sounded O
like O
a O
zoo O
, O
with O
screaming O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Although O
there O
was O
one O
nurse O
for O
every O
two O
or O
three O
children B-TER
, O
that O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
. O

Each O
child B-TER
wanted O
the O
undivided O
love O
and O
care O
of O
one O
person B-TER
for O
him- O
or O
herself O
. O

Although O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
toys O
, O
the O
children B-TER
would O
grab O
whatever O
another O
child B-TER
was O
holding O
. O

An O
adult O
who O
had O
been O
busy O
with O
these O
children B-TER
for O
about O
five O
hours O
would O
be O
completely O
exhausted O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O

There O
was O
no O
indication O
that O
– O
even O
with O
the O
utmost O
patience O
– O
it O
could O
be O
possible O
in O
a O
few O
years O
for O
these O
little O
animal O
creatures O
to O
react O
like O
human O
beings O
when O
approached O
. O

It O
was O
Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
– O
the O
children B-TER
simply O
call O
her O
Alice B-PER
– O
who O
devoted O
herself O
to O
their O
problems O
, O
just O
as O
she O
had O
previously O
to O
other O
tasks O
. O

She O
had O
been O
well O
known O
in O
Germany B-LOC
as O
a O
fully O
trained O
social O
worker B-TER
, O
running O
the O
Jewish O
crèche O
in O
the O
Grolmannstrasse B-LOC
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

The O
well O
- O
ordered O
life O
of O
the O
toddlers B-TER
, O
with O
sleep O
, O
personal O
hygiene B-TER
, O
food B-TER
, O
play O
and O
almost O
full O
- O
time O
outdoor O
activities O
in O
those O
wonderful O
summer O
weeks O
, O
worked O
wonders O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
the O
children B-TER
look O
different O
physically O
, O
one O
could O
sense O
that O
they O
were O
calming O
down O
; O
they O
gradually O
became O
more O
confident O
that O
the O
next O
day O
they O
would O
not O
be O
robbed O
of O
what O
they O
had O
been O
given O
the O
day O
before O
. O

After O
about O
three O
months O
in O
the O
large O
general O
reception O
camp B-TER
( O
which O
despite O
the O
psychological O
drawbacks O
had O
the O
positive O
effect O
of O
careful O
daily O
medical B-TER
supervision O
) O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
move O
Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
and O
her O
little O
ones O
, O
together O
with O
most O
of O
her O
staff O
, O
into O
a O
home B-TER
of O
their O
own O
, O
in O
a O
lovely O
rural O
area O
near O
London B-LOC
, O
Lingfield B-LOC
in O
Surrey B-LOC
. O

This O
home B-TER
has O
proved O
to O
be O
their O
real O
Zuhause O
home O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
and O
Alice B-PER
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
woman B-TER
who O
loves O
them O
like O
a O
mother O
but O
is O
not O
their O
mother O
( O
Alice B-PER
's I-PER
words O
) O
when O
the O
children B-TER
ask O
her O
whether O
she O
has O
now O
become O
their O
mother B-TER
. O

They O
love O
every O
single O
day O
they O
spend O
in O
this O
home B-TER
. O

A O
little O
girl B-TER
said O
: O
I O
do O
n’t O
like O
supper O
, O
because O
then O
we O
soon O
have O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
. O

I O
like O
breakfast O
best O
because O
it O
’s O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
whole O
new O
day O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fairytale O
home B-TER
, O
almost O
too O
beautiful O
and O
therefore O
almost O
unreal O
for O
an O
adult O
who O
takes O
a O
lively O
interest O
in O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
our O
world O
, O
in O
the O
problems O
of O
our O
era O
now O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

A O
large O
, O
long O
, O
two O
- O
storey O
manor O
house B-TER
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
huge O
hilly O
park O
, O
with O
wide O
lawns O
, O
great O
stands O
of O
trees O
, O
flowerbeds O
and O
orchards O
, O
and O
a O
swimming O
pool O
reserved O
for O
the O
children B-TER
provided O
by O
an O
old O
Jewish O
Sir O
. O

The O
furnishings B-TER
are O
simple O
and O
appropriate O
: O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
a O
very O
big O
playroom B-TER
with O
a O
grand O
piano B-TER
and O
glass O
doors O
opening O
onto O
the O
garden O
; O
next O
to O
it O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
, O
with O
lots O
of O
tables O
covered O
with O
oilcloth O
and O
light O
and O
cheerful O
colours O
and O
flowers O
everywhere O
. O

One O
the O
first O
floor O
there O
are O
bedrooms B-TER
with O
colourful O
blankets O
( O
each O
child B-TER
has O
their O
own O
small O
wardrobe O
) O
, O
three O
bathrooms B-TER
, O
lots O
of O
side O
rooms B-TER
and O
pleasant O
rooms B-TER
for O
the O
staff O
. O

This O
house B-TER
provides O
for O
a O
few O
years O
an O
ideal O
setting O
for O
convalescence O
, O
tranquillity O
and O
seclusion O
. O

Here O
the O
children B-TER
find O
peace O
, O
and O
from O
here O
they O
become O
acquainted O
with O
English B-LOC
children B-TER
of O
their O
own O
age O
, O
and O
the O
older O
ones O
go O
to O
school B-TER
. O

Now O
when O
you O
visit O
Lingfield B-LOC
House I-LOC
you O
meet O
healthy B-TER
-looking O
, O
beaming O
children B-TER
, O
spontaneous O
and O
at O
ease O
in O
their O
responses O
, O
who O
feel O
they O
are O
loved O
and O
understood O
, O
who O
play O
imaginatively O
and O
like O
to O
help O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
around O
the O
house B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
go O
to O
school B-TER
are O
almost O
all O
good O
pupils O
. O

The O
all O
feel O
they O
are O
one O
family B-TER
. O

This O
is O
best O
illustrated O
by O
the O
following O
little O
story O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
a O
six O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy B-TER
was O
visited O
by O
one O
of O
the O
financial B-TER
sponsors O
of O
the O
home B-TER
and O
was O
given O
a O
balloon O
, O
which O
made O
him O
extremely O
happy O
. O

Then O
he O
was O
told O
that O
he O
could O
now O
have O
something O
bigger O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
for O
a O
balloon O
for O
each O
child B-TER
at O
the O
home B-TER
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
can O
see O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
a O
superficial O
picture O
, O
but O
a O
real O
insight O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
children B-TER
lead O
the O
real O
lives B-TER
of O
children B-TER
, O
that O
they O
have O
become O
children B-TER
again O
. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
either O
that O
they O
live O
with O
the O
horrors O
of O
their O
past O
, O
both O
consciously O
and O
unconsciously O
. O

It O
was O
the O
family O
atmosphere O
at O
Lingfield B-LOC
which O
gradually O
encouraged O
them O
to O
talk O
. O

One O
evening O
, O
while O
she O
was O
having O
a O
bath B-TER
, O
a O
little O
girl B-TER
of O
about O
seven O
suddenly O
spoke O
about O
how O
her O
mother B-TER
was O
shot B-TER
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
and O
how O
she O
was O
horrified O
when O
she O
saw O
her O
lying O
there O
dead B-TER
and O
her O
little O
brother B-TER
being O
taken O
out O
of O
his O
pram O
. O

She O
ended O
by O
saying O
: O
Now O
we O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
speak O
about O
MuttiMummy O
any O
more O
. O

This O
girl B-TER
, O
who O
from O
the O
start O
seemed O
the O
most O
disturbed O
, O
had O
unfortunately O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
home B-TER
for O
mentally B-TER
disturbed I-TER
children B-TER
[ O
for O
] O
she O
could O
not O
stay O
with O
the O
other O
children B-TER
. O

It O
was O
she O
who O
, O
on O
the O
first O
evening O
in O
Windermere B-LOC
, O
had O
wandered O
through O
the O
house B-TER
screaming O
Do O
n’t O
take O
my O
little O
brother O
away O
. O

You O
wo O
n’t O
take O
my O
little O
brother O
, O
will O
you O
? O
She O
was O
always O
on O
the O
watch O
for O
cats B-TER
and O
dogs B-TER
, O
or O
something O
else O
that O
might O
frighten B-TER
her O
. O

As O
she O
was O
very O
graceful O
and O
responsive O
to O
music B-TER
, O
and O
sometimes O
even O
started O
to O
dance O
, O
it O
had O
been O
hoped O
at O
first O
that O
this O
would O
lead O
her O
to O
normality O
so O
that O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
stay O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
. O

A O
nine O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy B-TER
who O
– O
as O
was O
known O
– O
had O
been O
hidden B-TER
before O
being O
taken O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
often O
talks O
about O
death B-TER
, O
killing B-TER
, O
maltreatment B-TER
, O
but O
sometimes O
only O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
interesting O
adventure O
. O

Only O
recently O
did O
one O
of O
the O
older O
boys B-TER
tell O
how O
he O
had O
been O
systematically O
maltreated B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
to O
make O
him O
betray O
the O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
of O
his O
elder O
brother B-TER
. O

But O
this O
little O
lad O
, O
then O
not O
yet O
seven O
years O
old O
, O
had O
not O
given O
his O
brother B-TER
away O
despite O
the O
ill O
- O
treatment O
. O

When O
he O
came O
to O
Lingfield B-LOC
, O
very O
pale O
and O
thin O
, O
he O
fell O
ill O
almost O
immediately O
, O
suffering O
seizures O
in O
which O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes B-TER
from O
his O
body O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
physically O
fit O
, O
sings O
beautifully O
, O
and O
demonstrates O
strength O
of O
character O
, O
as O
well O
as O
kindness O
( O
eg O
towards O
younger O
children B-TER
) O
and O
a O
longing O
for O
excitement O
. O

Dennie O
was O
about O
four O
years O
old O
when O
he O
came O
to O
Windermere B-LOC
; O
now O
he O
is O
six O
, O
a O
frail O
, O
strange O
child B-TER
with O
fair O
curls O
and O
dark O
, O
distant O
eyes O
. O

He O
is O
extremely O
sensitive O
, O
can O
not O
bear O
any O
noise O
and O
is O
physically O
under O
- O
developed O
. O

He O
often O
speaks O
about O
God B-TER
: O
Where O
is O
God O
? O
Is O
God O
a O
He O
or O
a O
She O
? O
Is O
He O
up O
in O
the O
sky O
or O
below O
ground O
? O
Such O
are O
his O
questions O
. O

When O
he O
received O
a O
toy O
telephone O
for O
his O
birthday O
he O
said O
: O
I O
was O
lucky O
that O
I O
was O
not O
killed O
when O
I O
was O
a O
baby O
, O
was O
n’t O
I O
? O
Otherwise O
I O
would O
never O
have O
got O
the O
telephone O
. O

He O
asked O
his O
nurse O
: O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
my O
parents O
were O
shotdead O
? O
And O
then O
, O
When O
I O
am O
grown O
up O
I O
’ll O
marry O
Tanja O
[ O
his O
sister O
] O
and O
we O
’ll O
live O
in O
a O
small O
house O
, O
because O
we O
do O
n’t O
like O
many O
people O
around O
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
, O
while O
having O
his O
bath B-TER
, O
he O
urged O
his O
nurse O
to O
have O
a O
baby B-TER
: O
You O
must O
have O
a O
baby O
, O
for O
there O
is O
a O
baby O
that O
wants O
to O
be O
born O
. O

He O
is O
commended O
at O
school B-TER
for O
his O
achievements O
but O
still O
says O
, O
with O
the O
suffering O
face O
of O
an O
old O
man O
, O
My O
head O
is O
often O
completely O
empty O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Tanja O
, O
his O
sister B-TER
, O
is O
three O
years O
older O
and O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
clumsy O
and O
also O
mentally B-TER
extremely O
inflexible O
child B-TER
. O

She O
does O
not O
get O
on O
well O
at O
school B-TER
and O
loves O
smaller O
children B-TER
especially O
because O
to O
those O
she O
is O
superior O
. O

But O
she O
has O
one O
special O
talent O
: O
she O
dances O
beautifully O
. O

When O
dancing O
she O
is O
completely O
changed O
, O
she O
is O
a O
free O
little O
being O
. O

Every O
evening O
a O
group O
of O
children B-TER
sing B-TER
, O
forming O
a O
circle O
round O
Tanja O
who O
dances O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

This O
evening O
dance O
makes O
her O
calm O
and O
relaxed O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
gains O
her O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
others O
. O

Only O
once O
did O
she O
talk O
about O
her O
parental O
home B-TER
. O

Everything O
there O
had O
been O
bigger O
and O
much O
more O
beautiful O
than O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
: O
the O
garden O
, O
the O
house O
, O
just O
everything O
! O
She O
also O
talked O
about O
a O
sweet O
baby B-TER
with O
curly O
hair O
that O
they O
had O
had O
( O
certainly O
Dennie O
): O
much O
, O
much O
nicer O
that O
Dennie O
. O

She O
needed O
much O
more O
exclusive O
attention O
, O
more O
love O
and O
empathy O
, O
than O
the O
home B-TER
could O
give O
her O
since O
there O
were O
fifteen O
children B-TER
. O

A O
ten O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
came O
to O
Lingfield B-LOC
with O
her O
little O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
sister B-TER
( O
a O
brother B-TER
who O
was O
between O
them O
in O
age O
had O
died B-TER
) O
. O

When O
she O
arrived O
she O
resembled O
an O
old O
woman B-TER
in O
posture O
and O
outward O
appearance O
; O
she O
was O
completely O
covered O
in O
a O
rash B-TER
which O
she O
had O
caught O
from O
another O
girl B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

She O
had O
not O
wanted O
to O
hurt O
the O
other O
girl B-TER
’s I-TER
feelings O
, O
so O
she O
had O
stayed O
with O
her O
. O

She O
was O
very O
desperate O
because O
of O
her O
poor O
condition O
and O
at O
first O
she O
was O
very O
shy O
and O
continually O
depressed B-TER
. O

Later O
she O
told O
how O
one O
night O
she O
had O
dreamt O
distinctly O
of O
her O
mother B-TER
’s I-TER
death B-TER
and O
how O
her O
mother B-TER
had O
asked O
her O
to O
look O
after O
her O
younger O
brother B-TER
and O
sister B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
she O
had O
learnt O
that O
that O
had O
been O
the O
very O
night O
when O
her O
mother B-TER
died B-TER
. O

She O
says O
: O
Still O
, O
I O
ca O
n’t O
hate O
the O
Germans O
, O
and O
on O
another O
occasion O
she O
said O
: O
I O
believe O
that O
all O
religion O
is O
love O
. O

These O
few O
examples O
may O
suffice O
to O
show O
the O
reader O
to O
what O
extent O
these O
young O
orphans B-TER
, O
much O
more O
than O
other O
children B-TER
, O
are O
faced O
with O
the O
great O
and O
eternal O
questions O
of O
mankind O
, O
and O
how O
their O
souls O
really O
can O
not O
cope O
with O
them O
. O

For O
all O
of O
them O
death O
is O
something O
real O
and O
concrete O
. O

They O
have O
been O
continually O
surrounded O
by O
it O
. O

They O
simply O
do O
not O
understand O
that O
someone O
can O
die O
without O
being O
killed B-TER
by O
another O
person B-TER
. O

When O
a O
child B-TER
in O
another O
home B-TER
was O
hit O
by O
a O
car O
and O
died B-TER
they O
immediately O
suspected O
one O
of O
his O
friends O
had O
murdered B-TER
him O
. O

They O
all O
talked O
excitedly O
about O
that O
event O
, O
which O
haunted O
them O
for O
weeks O
. O

It O
is O
incomprehensible O
why O
from O
all O
the O
countless O
children B-TER
who O
were O
killed B-TER
just O
these O
survived B-TER
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
one O
mother B-TER
said O
before O
she O
was O
taken O
away O
that O
her O
little O
girls B-TER
, O
who O
were O
about O
the O
same O
size O
, O
were O
twins O
– O
because O
these O
were O
at O
first O
saved O
for O
medical B-TER
experiments I-TER
. O

In O
some O
cases O
neither O
the O
real O
names O
nor O
any O
dates O
are O
known O
. O

A O
little O
girl B-TER
explained O
with O
a O
beaming O
smile O
that O
Alice B-PER
had O
declared O
a O
certain O
day O
to O
be O
her O
birthday O
, O
and O
now O
she O
too O
could O
have O
a O
lovely O
birthday O
party O
, O
just O
like O
the O
others O
. O

The O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
physical O
state O
of O
health B-TER
is O
– O
as O
already O
mentioned O
– O
generally O
good O
. O

Their O
food B-TER
is O
simple O
and O
nourishing O
, O
they O
get O
plenty O
of O
vegetables B-TER
and O
fruit B-TER
grown O
in O
the O
garden O
. O

At O
first O
they O
could O
not O
be O
persuaded O
to O
eat B-TER
lettuce B-TER
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
like O
it O
, O
we O
’ve O
scoffed O
enough O
grass O
in O
the O
camp O
they O
said O
. O

There O
are O
children B-TER
of O
many O
different O
nations O
: O
Italy B-LOC
, O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
Romania B-LOC
, O
Germany B-LOC
, O
Austria B-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Their O
common O
language O
now O
is O
English B-LOC
, O
which O
they O
have O
learnt O
extremely O
quickly O
, O
just O
like O
a O
game O
, O
and O
which O
they O
speak O
at O
school B-TER
. O

At O
present O
there O
are O
no O
definite O
ideas O
about O
their O
future O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
children B-TER
need O
the O
warmth O
and O
feeling O
of O
togetherness O
of O
a O
close O
family B-TER
circle O
, O
and O
there O
are O
enough O
people B-TER
who O
would O
be O
ready O
to O
adopt B-TER
them O
. O

But O
so O
far O
only O
a O
few O
adoptions B-TER
have O
been O
permitted O
, O
in O
cases O
where O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
prospective O
parents O
were O
really O
prepared O
and O
sensitive O
enough O
to O
accept O
such O
a O
child B-TER
with O
all O
their O
problems O
, O
which O
might O
not O
yet O
be O
foreseeable O
. O

Among O
others O
there O
are O
a O
doctor B-TER
, O
who O
is O
a O
child B-TER
psychologist B-TER
, O
and O
a O
kindergarten B-TER
teacher O
, O
trained O
in O
psychology B-TER
, O
both O
of O
whom O
are O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
great O
task O
and O
responsibility O
they O
face O
, O
and O
they O
have O
adopted B-TER
one O
child B-TER
each O
. O

One O
child B-TER
is O
a O
very O
charming O
but O
very O
nervous B-TER
little O
boy B-TER
, O
the O
other O
a O
five O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
who O
is O
a O
simple O
character O
who O
had O
at O
first O
been O
considered O
to O
be O
mentally B-TER
retarded I-TER
and O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
a O
Child B-TER
Guidance O
Clinic B-TER
for O
a O
period O
of O
observation O
. O

There O
they O
discovered O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
setback O
in O
her O
development O
which O
she O
is O
gradually O
overcoming O
. O

She O
is O
definitely O
not O
what O
you O
would O
call O
an O
attractive O
child B-TER
, O
but O
she O
is O
lovable O
and O
needs O
a O
lot O
of O
affection O
. O

An O
operation O
to O
cure O
her O
squint O
has O
helped O
considerably O
to O
promote O
her O
development O
. O

I O
must O
say O
, O
it O
is O
very O
unusual O
in O
a O
case O
like O
this O
that O
there O
is O
someone O
willing O
to O
do O
everything O
for O
the O
girl B-TER
and O
is O
happy O
with O
this O
child B-TER
and O
the O
progress O
she O
is O
making O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
time O
now O
to O
make O
the O
children B-TER
more O
familiar O
with O
real O
life B-TER
, O
to O
end O
their O
rural O
isolation O
. O

And O
so O
the O
home B-TER
is O
planning O
to O
move O
to O
London B-LOC
in O
the O
near O
future O
, O
and O
they O
hope O
to O
find O
a O
simple O
house B-TER
and O
garden O
somewhere O
on O
the O
outskirts O
. O

There O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
even O
more O
than O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
to O
meet O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
needs O
: O
some O
need O
continuing O
contact O
with O
experienced O
child B-TER
psychologists B-TER
, O
others O
need O
better O
schools B-TER
which O
will O
meet O
their O
individual O
needs O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
, O
and O
others O
again O
could O
do O
with O
more O
varied O
lessons O
in O
accordance O
with O
their O
special O
talents O
. O

Perhaps O
there O
will O
be O
more O
adoptions B-TER
in O
time O
. O

But O
a O
small O
nucleus O
of O
children B-TER
who O
can O
not O
be O
transplanted O
will O
stay O
and O
form O
a O
kind O
of O
natural O
family B-TER
. O

Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
will O
go O
on O
guiding O
their O
education B-TER
in O
the O
most O
caring O
and O
attentive O
way O
until O
they O
start O
work B-TER
or O
go O
on O
to O
vocational B-TER
training I-TER

Her O

Due O
to O
her O
mother O
’s O
contact O
with O
Jewish O
people B-TER
, O
as O
a O
child B-TER
Helene B-PER
mainly O
had O
Jewish O
friends O
throughout O
her O
school B-TER
years O
. O

The O
other O
Christian B-TER
schoolgirls B-TER
resented O
her O
for O
this O
, O
which O
later O
led O
to O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
isolation O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
dance O
classes B-TER
. O

One O
lifelong O
friendship O
with O
a O
Jewish O
girl O
began O
in O
the O
pram O
. O

It O
was O
not O
unusual O
in O
Teplice B-LOC
for O
Jews O
and O
Christians B-TER
to O
meet O
, O
since O
the O
well O
- O
off O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
held O
a O
fairly O
dominant O
position O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
many O
Jewish O
boarders O
were O
living O
in O
Helene B-PER
's I-PER
grandmother O
’s O
house B-TER
( O
later O
her O
mother O
’s O
) O
, O
so O
friendly O
relations O
began O
quite O
naturally.chr O
As O
a O
young O
woman B-TER
, O
through O
her O
interest O
in O
sport B-TER
Helene B-PER
mostly O
socialised O
with O
Christian B-TER
groups O
. O

She O
was O
well O
- O
known O
as O
a O
tennis B-TER
player I-TER
. O

A O
close O
friendship O
with O
a O
man B-TER
built O
up O
on O
this O
basis O
. O

With O
time O
however O
, O
this O
changed O
and O
at O
the O
age O
of O
25 O
Helene B-PER
married B-TER
a O
Jewish O
man B-TER
who O
was O
born O
in O
Teplice B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
engagement O
was O
announced O
, O
Helene B-PER
was O
annoyed O
by O
the O
Christian B-TER
and O
the O
Jewish O
families B-TER
alike O
in O
that O
the O
Christians B-TER
found O
it O
wrong O
that O
she O
should O
marry B-TER
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
the O
Jews O
found O
this O
Jew O
socially O
beneath O
her O
. O

The O
marriage B-TER
was O
however O
especially O
good O
– O
until O
Hitler B-PER
and O
the O
circumstances O
created O
by O
him O
interfered O
. O

The O
husband O
, O
Egon B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
, O
was O
a O
top O
insurance B-TER
agent B-TER
at O
the O
Viktoria O
company B-TER
. O

He O
got O
a O
job B-TER
in O
Bodenbach B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
young O
couple O
relocated O
( O
1930 O
) O
. O

There O
they O
only O
had O
contact O
with O
Jewish O
people B-TER
, O
the O
Jews O
and O
the O
Christians B-TER
did O
not O
socialise O
. O

They O
did O
have O
one O
non O
- O
Jewish O
acquaintance O
, O
a O
colleague O
of O
Egon B-PER
’s I-PER
who O
often O
came O
to O
their O
house B-TER
. O

He O
was O
resented O
for O
this O
by O
the O
Christian B-TER
side O
. O

In O
1933 O
Egon B-PER
was O
moved O
to O
Karlsbad B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
an O
improvement O
in O
every O
way O
. O

They O
felt O
so O
happy O
there O
that O
Egon B-PER
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
the O
place O
when O
in O
1938 O
Hitler B-PER
annexed B-TER
the O
Sudentenland B-LOC
and O
almost O
all O
Jews O
fled O
to O
( O
at O
that O
time O
still O
safe O
) O
Prague B-LOC
. O

But O
Helene B-PER
finally O
managed O
to O
persuade O
him O
, O
so O
they O
both O
went O
to O
Prague B-LOC
leaving O
everything O
behind O
in O
Karlsbad B-LOC
. O

The O
atmosphere O
there O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
was O
extremely O
depressing O
and O
Egon B-PER
and O
Helene B-PER
felt O
altogether O
so O
unhappy O
that O
they O
returned O
to O
Karlsbad B-LOC
. O

But O
not O
for O
long O
! O
After O
a O
week O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
Sudentenland B-LOC
got O
so O
much O
worse O
that O
they O
again O
fled B-TER
to O
Prague B-LOC
, O
this O
time O
for O
good O
. O

In O
1939 O
however O
, O
Hitler B-PER
also O
occupied B-TER
Prague B-LOC
. O

Helene B-PER
assessed O
the O
situation O
more O
accurately O
than O
her O
husband O
and O
she O
pulled O
out O
all O
the O
stops O
to O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
them O
both O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

In O
her O
spirited O
manner O
she O
went O
directly O
with O
Egon B-PER
’s I-PER
passport B-TER
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
in O
order O
to O
get O
him O
a O
permit B-TER
to O
leave B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
, O
she O
came O
up O
with O
the O
excuse O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
visit O
his O
sick O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O

She O
also O
managed O
to O
get O
him O
a O
ticket O
, O
and O
so O
he O
was O
able O
to O
make O
the O
journey O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

Helene B-PER
herself O
was O
not O
granted O
permission B-TER
to O
leave B-TER
, O
since O
as O
a O
Christian B-TER
she O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
. O

Her O
passport B-TER
was O
even O
taken O
away O
and O
she O
only O
got O
it O
back O
two O
months O
later O
. O

She O
kept O
trying O
, O
but O
when O
she O
finally O
was O
allowed O
to O
leave B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
, O
she O
did O
not O
get O
the O
visa B-TER
for O
England B-LOC
, O
so O
had O
to O
stay O
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Until O
he O
left O
in O
March O
1939 O
, O
Egon B-PER
was O
able O
to O
continue O
working B-TER
for O
his O
insurance B-TER
company I-TER
Viktoria B-ORG
in O
Prague B-LOC
. O

The O
marriage B-TER
was O
dissolved B-TER
upon O
the O
orders O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
once O
Egon B-PER
’s I-PER
passport B-TER
had O
arrived O
from O
England B-LOC
. O

Until O
1946 O
when O
Helene B-PER
was O
finally O
able O
to O
join O
her O
husband O
living O
in O
London B-LOC
, O
her O
life O
went O
by O
as O
follows O
: O
Since O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
there O
was O
labour O
conscription O
, O
she O
looked O
for O
work B-TER
although O
she O
did O
not O
have O
the O
financial B-TER
need O
to O
. O

She O
joined O
a O
Czech B-LOC
lawyer O
who O
needed O
to O
take O
on O
someone O
who O
could O
speak O
German B-LOC
, O
where O
she O
worked B-TER
in O
office O
service O
. O

After O
she O
had O
been O
working B-TER
there O
about O
a O
year O
, O
she O
gave O
up O
the O
job B-TER
and O
, O
as O
she O
was O
used O
to O
doing O
, O
went O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
do O
winter O
sports B-TER
in O
the O
mountains O
. O

This O
surprising O
fact O
was O
brought O
about O
by O
a O
doctor B-TER
’s I-TER
certificate O
stating O
that O
she O
had O
TB B-TER
. O

The O
reasoning O
given O
was O
that O
the O
X O
- O
ray O
image O
showed O
a O
healed O
over O
shadow O
and O
the O
longstanding O
slightly O
raised B-TER
temperatures I-TER
were O
indicative O
of O
TB B-TER
. O

The O
lung B-TER
disease I-TER
of O
an O
aunt O
who O
had O
died B-TER
early O
was O
also O
put O
to O
use O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

In O
fact O
Helene B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
never O
had O
any O
such O
disease B-TER
, O
but O
the O
employment B-TER
office I-TER
never O
made O
any O
difficulties O
for O
her O
, O
neither O
this O
first O
time O
, O
nor O
over O
any O
of O
the O
other O
various O
later O
medical B-TER
certificates O
. O

Also O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
ammunitions O
factory B-TER
, O
she O
was O
exempted O
. O

She O
worked B-TER
in O
various O
roles O
, O
either O
where O
the O
employment O
of O
a O
German B-LOC
was O
required O
, O
or O
else O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Viktoria B-ORG
, O
where O
in O
view O
of O
Egon B-PER
’s I-PER
work B-TER
there O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
help O
her O
. O

On O
one O
occasion O
she O
found O
employment O
through O
a O
Christian B-TER
manager O
who O
had O
declared O
his O
Jewish O
wife O
as O
a O
half B-TER
Jew I-TER
, O
felt O
insecure O
and O
wanted O
to O
hire O
anyone O
who O
he O
knew O
to O
have O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Nazi I-TER
stance O
. O

Helene B-PER
used O
these O
various O
jobs B-TER
, O
where O
opportunities O
always O
arose O
, O
to O
sabotage B-TER
the O
work B-TER
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

She O
also O
sheltered B-TER
a O
Jewish O
acquaintance O
in O
her O
place O
of O
living O
for O
a O
while O
. O

He O
had O
come O
to O
Prague B-LOC
after O
his O
Christian B-TER
wife O
had O
driven O
him O
out O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
eventually O
discovered O
and O
sent O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
where O
he O
took B-TER
his I-TER
own I-TER
life I-TER
by O
touching O
electrically O
charged O
barbed O
wire O
. O

A O
month O
and O
a O
half O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
Helene B-PER
was O
able O
to O
go O
to O
Teplice B-LOC
to O
see O
her O
mother O
with O
a O
certificate B-TER
from O
the O
employment B-TER
office O
, O
again O
acknowledging O
her O
tuberculosis B-TER
. O

She O
had O
to O
attend O
a O
doctor B-TER
in O
Teplice B-LOC
, O
who O
gave O
her O
very O
painful O
injections O
against O
the O
supposed O
disease B-TER
, O
but O
she O
wanted O
to O
stay O
in O
Teplice B-LOC
so O
she O
had O
to O
put O
herself O
through O
that O
. O

Two O
months O
after O
the O
peace O
agreement O
, O
when O
the O
Russians B-LOC
occupied B-TER
Teplice B-LOC
, O
the O
two O
women B-TER
( O
the O
mother O
was O
still O
alive O
) O
took O
French B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
under O
their O
protection O
in O
their O
house B-TER
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
fear B-TER
of O
the O
Russians B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
also O
troubled O
by O
the O
possibility O
of O
deportation B-TER
, O
and O
this O
drove O
the O
mother O
to O
suicide B-TER
. O

Helene B-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
to O
be O
able O
to O
go O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

She O
profusely O
thanked O
an O
English B-LOC
lady B-TER
, O
a O
Christian B-TER
, O
who O
had O
readily O
accepted O
Egon B-PER
, O
for O
her O
tireless O
efforts O
. O

Since O
Egon B-PER
had O
always O
declared O
himself O
to O
the O
authorities O
in O
England B-LOC
as O
married B-TER
, O
it O
was O
soon O
possible O
to O
get O
the O
marriage B-TER
, O
which O
had O
only O
been O
dissolved B-TER
under O
the O
Nazi B-TER
regime I-TER
, O
legally O
valid O
again O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
their O
experiences O
over O
the O
seven O
years O
of O
their O
separation O
had O
estranged O
them O
so O
much O
from O
one O
another O
, O
after O
three O
years O
together O
, O
Helene B-PER
and O
Egon B-PER
again O
divorced O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
like O
almost O
all O
refugees B-TER
, O
Helene B-PER
tried O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
types O
of O
work B-TER
. O

In O
1947 O
she O
eventually O
got O
a O
job B-TER
as O
a O
secretary O
for O
the O
European O
Service O
of O
the O
BBC B-ORG
, O
where O
she O
still O
works B-TER
today O
. O

Helene B-PER
's I-PER
possessions O
and O
the O
large O
house B-TER
in O
Teplice B-LOC
were O
lost O
through O
the O
circumstances O
without O
any O
prospect O
of O
proportionate O
refunding B-TER

May O
1933 O
I O
, O
the O
undersigned O
Erna B-PER
Meyer I-PER
hereby O
swear O
by O
this O
affidavit O
that O
the O
following O
statement O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
am O
fully O
aware O
that O
this O
statement O
is O
to O
be O
used O
by O
a O
Swiss B-LOC
law B-TER

I O
am O
aware O
that O
those O
who O

either O

are O

severe O
penalties O
under O
the O
criminal B-TER
law I-TER
of O
all O
countries O
including O
Switzerland B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
and O
of O
course O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
morality O
which O
requires O
me O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
and O
nothing O
but O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
have O
considered O
every O
word O
that O
I O
have O
written O
and O
fully O
guarantee O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
affidavit O
. O

I O
had O
a O
brother B-TER
, O
Dr O
Alfred B-PER
Meyer I-PER
, O
who O
was O
born O
on O
24 O
March O
1898 O
. O

He O
left O
grammar O
school B-TER
even O
before O
the O
age O
of O
seventeen O
to O
join O
the O
army B-TER
as O
a O
volunteer O
; O
in O
February O
1915 O
he O
marched O
into O
battle B-TER
and O
was O
a O
soldier B-TER
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

He O
was O
wounded B-TER
no O
less O
than O
three O
times O
but O
nevertheless O
went O
back O
to O
the O
battlefield B-TER
each O
time O
, O
was O
awarded O
the O
Bayrische O
Verdienstkreuz O
and O
the O
Iron B-TER
Cross I-TER
Second I-TER
Class I-TER
, O
and O
was O
promoted O
to O
Vizewachtmeister O
. O

On O
returning O
from O
the O
war B-TER
he O
completed O
his O
education B-TER
, O
first O
at O
school B-TER
where O
he O
passed O
the O
Abitur B-TER
; O
he O
then O
studied O
dentistry B-TER
and O
set O
up O
in O
practice O
as O
a O
dentist B-TER
in O
Wuppertal B-LOC
- I-LOC
Barmen I-LOC
. O

He O
had O
never O
been O
active O
politically B-TER
, O
either O
before O
or O
after O
this O
; O
in O
particular O
, O
he O
had O
never O
been O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Socialist B-TER
or O
Communist B-TER
Parties I-TER
, O
nor O
had O
he O
ever O
done O
anything O
for O
any O
of O
these O
parties B-TER
. O

Even O
before O
the O
revolution O
of O
1933 O
he O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
antipathy O
towards O
him O
in O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
circles O
in O
Barmen B-LOC
; O
he O
attributed O
this O
to O
the O
fact O
not O
only O
that O
he O
was O
a O
Jew O
, O
but O
also O
that O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
of O
Barmen B-LOC
, O
a O
dentist B-TER
named O
Viering B-PER
, O
had O
had O
his O
practice O
opposite O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
as O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
very O
popular O
with O
his O
patients O
he O
Viering B-PER
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
a O
practice O
. O

This O
Viering B-PER
had O
been O
sued O
for O
libel O
even O
before O
the O
revolution O
of O
1933 O
because O
he O
had O
stated O
that O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
suffering O
from O
a O
sexually B-TER
transmitted I-TER
disease I-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
underwent O
a O
very O
thorough O
examination O
proving O
that O
this O
accusation O
was O
completely O
false O
. O

Consequently O
, O
Viering B-PER
was O
punished O
. O

Viering B-PER
tried O
another O
libel O
, O
saying O
that O
my O
brother B-TER
, O
in O
his O
capacity O
as O
a O
certifying O
doctor B-TER
, O
had O
produced O
false O
certificates O
for O
patients O
to O
claim O
on O
national O
health B-TER
insurance B-TER
. O

Again O
, O
this O
accusation O
was O
proved O
to O
be O
unfounded O
after O
the O
dentists B-TER
’ I-TER
professional O
body O
had O
thoroughly O
examined O
the O
case O
and O
found O
my O
brother B-TER
to O
be O
blameless O
. O

After O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
revolution O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
house B-TER
was O
immediately O
searched B-TER
but O
nothing O
was O
found O
which O
might O
be O
used O
against O
him O
in O
some O
way O
. O

These O
searches O
were O
mainly O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
following O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
: O
Fischer B-PER
, O
Viering B-PER
, O
Birkenstock B-PER
and O
Noelle B-PER
. O

These O
searches B-TER
took O
place O
at O
a O
time O
when O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
travelling O
abroad O
trying O
to O
discover O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
possibility O
for O
him O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
then O
returned O
and O
even O
went O
back O
to O
Barmen B-LOC
despite O
several O
warnings O
, O
because O
he O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
he O
was O
an O
honest O
and O
upright O
man B-TER
, O
and O
that O
running O
away O
would O
be O
the O
action O
of O
a O
coward O
. O

Whilst O
he O
was O
in O
Barmen B-LOC
he O
felt O
so O
persecuted B-TER
that O
one O
night O
he O
did O
not O
sleep O
at O
home B-TER
but O
instead O
at O
a O
friend O
’s O
. O

During O
the O
night O
his O
house B-TER
was O
searched B-TER
again O
. O

This O
search B-TER
was O
conducted O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
damage O
to O
the O
property B-TER
was O
clearly O
intended O
. O

The O
next O
day O
my O
brother B-TER
went O
to O
the O
police B-TER
and O
asked O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
so O
- O
called O
voluntary O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
because O
he O
feared B-TER
for O
his O
life O
. O

The O
police B-TER
did O
as O
he O
asked O
and O
so O
he O
spent O
the O
time O
from O
the O
end O
of O
March O
until O
10 O
May O
in O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
. O

I O
must O
state O
, O
however O
, O
that O
his O
voluntary O
stay O
in O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
became O
involuntary O
during O
this O
time O
because O
an O
investigation B-TER
was O
started O
against O
him O
, O
for O
political B-TER
reasons O
. O

This O
investigation B-TER
was O
extremely O
hard O
for O
him O
, O
mainly O
because O
he O
tried O
desperately O
for O
five O
weeks O
to O
have O
his O
first O
interrogation B-TER
, O
which O
in O
the O
end O
was O
only O
brought O
about O
by O
friends O
, O
including O
non O
- O
Jewish O
friends O
, O
who O
finally O
convinced O
the O
authorities O
to O
carry O
out O
an O
interrogation B-TER
. O

The O
investigation B-TER
did O
not O
bring O
anything O
to O
light O
since O
, O
as O
already O
mentioned O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
that O
could O
come O
to O
light O
, O
and O
so O
he O
was O
released B-TER
on O
10 O
May O
1933 O
. O

In O
the O
night O
after O
his O
release B-TER
his O
house B-TER
was O
searched B-TER
again O
; O
he O
was O
not O
at O
home B-TER
because O
he O
had O
preferred O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
at O
the O
house B-TER
of O
a O
Christian B-TER
family B-TER
he O
was O
friendly O
with O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
his O
flat B-TER
was O
devastated O
, O
all O
kinds O
of O
valuables O
like O
record O
players O
and O
records O
were O
destroyed B-TER
, O
carpets O
were O
slashed O
, O
lamps O
were O
broken O
, O
the O
fully O
fitted O
kitchen O
was O
torn O
out O
. O

Many O
valuable O
goods O
were O
stolen O
, O
and O
they O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
take O
away O
his O
suits B-TER
and O
shoes B-TER
. O

After O
this O
occurrence O
my O
brother B-TER
preferred O
to O
leave O
Barmen B-LOC
and O
after O
spending O
some O
days O
somewhere O
else O
he O
started O
work B-TER
as O
a O
dentist B-TER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
whilst O
preparing O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

His O
wife B-TER
, O
also O
a O
dentist B-TER
, O
had O
a O
practice O
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
and O
the O
two O
decided O
to O
stand O
in O
for O
each O
other O
until O
they O
could O
emigrate B-TER
, O
as O
having O
only O
a O
little O
money B-TER
they O
could O
not O
do O
without O
an O
income O
. O

On O
16 O
May O
the O
telephone O
rang O
in O
his O
practice O
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
Noelle B-PER
– O
already O
mentioned O
above O
– O
who O
asked O
whether O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
there O
and O
when O
the O
answer O
was O
yes O
he O
said O
, O
that O
s O
all O
I O
want O
to O
know O
’ O
and O
rang O
off O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
he O
rang O
again O
and O
soon O
after O
the O
call O
my O
brother B-TER
left O
the O
practice O
and O
went O
to O
a O
family B-TER
he O
was O
friendly O
with O
. O

In O
the O
street O
he O
was O
followed O
and O
soon O
after O
he O
had O
arrived O
a O
car O
stopped O
in O
which O
there O
were O
five O
people B-TER
, O
among O
them O
the O
four O
mentioned O
above O
, O
who O
had O
taken O
part O
in O
the O
previous O
searches B-TER
. O

Viering B-PER
stayed O
at O
the O
wheel O
, O
the O
four O
others O
went O
into O
the O
flat B-TER
, O
threw O
my O
brother B-TER
onto O
the O
floor O
, O
tied O
him O
up O
and O
dragged O
him O
into O
the O
car O
. O

The O
other O
people B-TER
present O
were O
also O
tied O
up O
, O
and O
as O
one O
of O
them O
had O
tried O
to O
get O
to O
the O
telephone O
to O
call O
for O
help O
before O
being O
tied O
up O
, O
the O
telephone O
was O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
any O
communication O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
impossible O
. O

The O
registration B-TER
number O
had O
been O
noted O
by O
several O
people B-TER
but O
the O
investigation B-TER
showed O
that O
it O
was O
false O
. O

The O
help O
the O
police B-TER
gave O
us O
was O
just O
a O
formality O
with O
no O
practical O
and O
effective O
support O
at O
all O
, O
and O
so O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
discover O
his O
whereabouts O
. O

At O
first O
we O
had O
engaged O
the O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
lawyer B-TER
KINTZEN B-PER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
; O
he O
, O
however O
, O
later O
terminated O
the O
brief O
because O
the O
Party B-TER
had O
advised O
him O
not O
to O
engage O
in O
this O
case O
– O
a O
fact O
we O
do O
know O
for O
certain O
. O

Some O
days O
after O
my O
brother B-TER
had O
disappeared O
a O
forester O
informed O
[ O
us O
] O
that O
at O
the O
Bewerdam O
, O
between O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
and O
Barmen B-LOC
, O
the O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
of O
a O
man B-TER
had O
been O
washed O
up O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
corpse B-TER
, O
which O
had O
been O
thrown O
into O
the O
water O
; O
his O
head O
had O
been O
stuck O
into O
a O
sack O
and O
his O
feet O
tied O
to O
a O
copy O
machine O
to O
prevent O
the O
body B-TER
from O
surfacing O
. O

There O
must O
have O
been O
very O
particular O
circumstances O
which O
allowed O
the O
body B-TER
to O
come O
up O
again O
nevertheless O
. O

We O
ourselves O
did O
not O
get O
the O
body B-TER
– O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
was O
handed O
over O
several O
days O
later O
to O
the O
chief O
rabbi B-TER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
who O
in O
exchange O
had O
strict O
orders O
not O
to O
show O
his O
corpse B-TER
to O
his O
relatives O
. O

Later O
we O
learnt O
– O
not O
from O
the O
rabbi B-TER
but O
from O
others O
who O
had O
seen O
the O
corpse B-TER
– O
that O
he O
had O
been O
stabbed B-TER
in O
the O
abdomen B-TER
and O
other O
parts O
of O
his O
body O
; O
he O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
head O
twice O
and O
his O
body B-TER
had O
been O
maltreated O
and O
mutilated O
in O
a O
disgusting O
way O
. O

The O
court B-TER
refused O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
case O
, O
so O
the O
records O
were O
sent O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
but O
are O
said O
to O
have O
been O
lost O
in O
transit O
. O

By O
order O
of O
the O
authorities O
the O
funeral B-TER
was O
secret O
and O
very O
quiet O
. O

Any O
newspapers B-TER
which O
reported O
the O
case O
were O
confiscated B-TER
. O

We O
were O
dictated O
the O
text O
of O
the O
obituary O
notice O
, O
so O
we O
preferred O
to O
simply O
inform O
people B-TER

On O
19 O
March O
1944 O
Hitler B-PER
invaded B-TER
Hungary B-LOC
and O
for O
Jews O
this O
was O
the O
start O
of O
torments O
which O
Mr B-PER
Fábri I-PER
describes O
in O
their O
entire O
enormity O
. O

All O
Jews O
from O
Ungvár B-LOC
and O
the O
surrounding O
area O
were O
herded O
together O
in O
a O
ghetto B-TER
, O
in O
a O
brick O
factory B-TER
in O
Ungvár B-LOC
. O

There O
were O
about O
30 O
000 O
people B-TER
. O

The O

and O
even O
women B-TER
who O
had O
just O
given O
birth O
were O
put O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
says O
that O
only O
someone O
who O
has O
seen O
a O
brick O
factory B-TER
can O
have O
any O
idea O
of O
what O
this O
situation O
was O
like O
. O

For O
brick O
manufacture O
the O
air O
in O
the O
buildings O
has O
to O
circulate O
and O
the O
buildings O
have O
to O
be O
well O
- O
ventilated O
and O
wet O
; O
the O
barracks O
had O
no O
walls O
. O

There O
was O
one O
barrack O
which O
was O
set O
apart O
from O
the O
others O
where O
people B-TER
were O
beaten B-TER
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
find O
out O
where O
they O
had O
hidden B-TER
money B-TER
or O
gold O
. O

Some O
died B-TER
in O
the O
process O
. O

Once O
a O
day O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
given O
soup B-TER
, O
they O
had O
to O
carry O
the O
water B-TER
to O
the O
barracks O
themselves O
and O
were O
often O
beaten B-TER
on O
the O
way O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
remained O
in O
the O
brick O
factory B-TER
until O
17 O
May O
and O
were O
then O
loaded O
into O
carriages B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

The O
transport B-TER
took O
place O
in O
locked O
carriages B-TER
where O
they O
had O
to O
stand O
close O
together O
. O

They O
were O
given O
no O
food B-TER
, O
no O
water B-TER
; O
there O
was O
one O
bucket O
for O
100 O
people B-TER
. O

There O
was O
no O
air O
, O
as O
neither O
doors O
nor O
windows O
were O
opened O
. O

Some O
people B-TER
could O
n’t O
stand O
it O
, O
died B-TER
maybe O
, O
went O
mad B-TER
. O

A O
mother O
hanged B-TER
her O
child B-TER
to O
spare O
it O
this O
and O
what O
was O
to O
come O
. O

After O
3 O
days O
the O
doors O
were O
opened O
, O
everyone O
was O
let O
out O
. O

The O
people B-TER
arriving O
were O
met O
by O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
, O
some O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
for O
longer O
were O
there O
too O
. O

Men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
were O
now O
separated B-TER
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
was O
so O
agitated O
and O
confused O
that O
he O
did O
not O
notice O
this O
and O
did O
not O
say O
goodbye O
to O
either O
his O
wife B-TER
and O
child B-TER
or O
to O
his O
other O
family B-TER
members I-TER
, O
a O
sister O
with O
a O
two O
- O
year O
- O
old O
child B-TER
and O
several O
cousins O
. O

His O
mother O
was O
also O
amongst O
them O
. O

He O
saw O
none O
of O
them O
again O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
to O
avoid O
panic O
, O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
promised O
that O
they O
would O
see O
their O
relatives B-TER
again O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

There O
were O
cars O
standing O
there O
for O
the O
old O
people B-TER
who O
could O
not O
walk O
. O

They O
were O
driven O
to O
Reisko O
[ O
handwritten O

in O
the O

] O
, O
an O
area O
where O
open O
graves B-TER
were O
waiting O
, O
in O
which O
they O
were O
buried B-TER
alive I-TER
. O

The O
old O
people B-TER
who O
could O
still O
walk O
were O
sent O
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

Mengele B-PER
, O
doctor B-TER
and O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
, O
was O
waiting O
for O
the O
new O
arrivals O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

He O
pointed O
at O
random O
to O
people B-TER
who O
were O
to O
be O
cremated B-TER
immediately O
and O
those O
who O
were O
to O
stay O
alive O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
’s I-PER
father O
was O
also O
amongst O
those O
selected B-TER
to O
die B-TER
. O

This O
transport B-TER
was O
the O
last O
in O
which O
a O
selection B-TER
was O
made O
, O
from O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
on O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
taken O
straight O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

It O
should O
be O
mentioned O
here O
as O
an O
aside O
that O
Mengele B-PER
was O
hanged B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
after O
the O
Nuremberg B-LOC
trial B-TER
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
the O
people B-TER
had O
all O
their O
clothes B-TER
taken O

. O

Their O
heads O
and O

were O
shaved O
, O
they O
were O

and O
the O
branded O
camp B-TER
number O
, O
Mr O
F B-PER
’s I-PER
was O
A O

. O

Then O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
gypsy B-TER
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

Here O
they O
were O
housed B-TER
in O
windowless O
barracks B-TER
which O
had O
previously O
been O
used O
as O
stables O
. O

2000 O
people B-TER
together O
, O
only O
room O
to O
stand O
, O
no O
beds O
. O

Mad B-TER
and O
dying B-TER
people B-TER
amongst O
them O
. O

For O
2 O
days O
they O
were O
given O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
then O
a O
bowl O
of O
soup B-TER
for O
4 O
people B-TER
but O
no O
spoons O
. O

Once O
a O
day O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
relieve O
themselves O
. O

After O
a O
week O
a O
further O
selection B-TER
was O
made O
amongst O
those O
who O
were O
under O
44 O
years O
old O
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
was O
41 O
and O
was O
allocated O

their O
workplace B-TER
they O
had O
to O
run O
10 O
– O
12 O
kilometres O
at O
a O
fast O
pace O
. O

Anyone O
who O
was O
too O
slow O
was O
beaten O
by O
the O
Kapos O
( O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
or O
Poles B-LOC
) O
in O
charge O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
had O
to O
get O
up O
at O
4:30 O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
then O
stand O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
until O
6:30 O
, O
then O
go O
to O
work B-TER
where O
they O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
bending O
down O
pulling O
out O
weeds O
. O

Standing O
up O
straight O
was O
not O
allowed O
. O

At O
midday O
there O
was O
a O
break O
when O
they O
were O
given O
dried O
vegetables B-TER
. O

One O
day O
they O
were O
told O
to O
take O
white O
sand O
which O
was O
standing O
ready O
in O
boxes O
and O
scatter O
it O
on O
the O
fields O
by O
hand O
. O

The O
sand O
was O
the O
bone O
meal O
of O
the O
people B-TER
who O
had O
been O
cremated B-TER
. O

It O
burned O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ O
hands O
which O
were O
damp O
due O
to O
the O
heat O
and O
many O
people B-TER
sustained O
deep O
wounds B-TER
. O

One O
day O
, O
when O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
could O
no O
longer O
walk O
fast O
enough O
, O
an O
SS B-ORG
soldier B-TER
shot O
him O
in O
the O
foot O
. O

He O
was O
then O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
hospital I-TER
. O

This O
was O
on O
10 O
August O
1944 O
. O

On O
30 O
August O
a O
doctor B-TER
came O
and O
picked O
out O
40 O
patients O
from O
amongst O
those O
present O
, O
amongst O
them O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
. O

The O
selected B-TER
men B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
a O
secret O
barrack O
as O
guinea O
pigs O
for O
medical O
experiments O
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
was O
given O
malaria B-TER
and O
infected O
with O
other O
substances O
unknown O
to O
him O
. O

For O
this O
he O
was O
strapped O
to O
a O
table O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
saw O
was O
used O
to O
make O
deep O
incisions O
into O
which O
the O
substance O
was O
introduced O
. O

Pieces O
were O
cut O
out O
so O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
the O
effect O
in O
the O
wound B-TER
better O
. O

This O
was O
done O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
anaesthetic B-TER
and O
was O
of O
course O
extremely O
painful O
. O

Even O
today O
I O
was O
still O
able O
to O
see O
the O
resulting O
scars O
on O
his O
hands O
and O
legs O
. O

On O
16 O
January O
1945 O
, O
37 O
of O
the O
40 O
men B-TER
used O
for O
the O
experiments B-TER
were O
fetched O
and O
gassed B-TER
immediately O
so O
as O
to O
not O
disclose O
the O
crime O
. O

Only O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
and O
two O
other O
men B-TER
stayed O
behind O
as O
the O
wounds B-TER
had O
not O
yet O
healed O
and O
the O
experiments B-TER
could O
therefore O
not O
be O
regarded O
as O
completed O
. O

The O
three O
were O
thus O
the O
only O
survivors B-TER
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
has O
documents O
which O
confirm O
the O
events O
. O

( O
see O
film O
) O
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
stayed O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
the O
secret O
barrack O
, O
until O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
liberated B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-LOC
on O
16 O
January O
1945 O
. O

The O
Russians B-LOC
took O
him O
immediately O
to O
Krakow B-LOC
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

There O
it O
was O
found O
that O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
, O
who O
had O
in O
the O
past O
weighted O
80 O
kilos O
, O
now O
only O
weighted O
35 O
kilos O
. O

On O
15 O
July O
1945 O
he O
was O
discharged O
from O
hospital B-TER
and O
, O
together O
with O
another O
group O
, O
made O
his O
way O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
travelling O
on O
foot O
( O
which O
was O
only O
possible O
with O
orthopaedic B-TER
boots I-TER
, O
see O
final O
remark O
) O
and O
breaking O
the O
journey O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

Welfare B-TER
organisations I-TER
helped O
them O
with O
this O
undertaking O
. O

On O
the O
way O
they O
received O
help O
and O
friendly O
treatment O
from O
Poles B-LOC
and O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

The O
Russians B-LOC
suspected O
them O
of O
being O
spies O
, O
which O
caused O
problems O
. O

On O
arrival O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
found O
his O
only O
surviving B-TER
sister B-TER
who O
had O
spent O
the O
time O
in O
Ravensbrück B-LOC
. O

He O
went O
to O
Ungvár B-LOC
to O
see O
what O
had O
become O
of O
his O
former O
house B-TER
and O
found O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
had O
taken O
everything O
that O
had O
been O
left O
there O
. O

Only O
money B-TER
that O
he O
had O
buried O
was O
still O
there O
and O
this O
helped O
him O
to O
pay O
for O
his O
subsistence O
because O
until O
1948 O
he O
was O
too O
sick B-TER
to O
be O
able O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Then O
he O
began O
to O
weave O
scarves O
and O
was O
able O
to O
make O
a O
living O
from O
this O
. O

On O
25 O
October O
1945 O
he O
married B-TER
Ilona B-PER
Braun I-PER
from O
Ungvár B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
also O
been O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

A O
separate O
report O
will O
describe O
her O
experiences O
there O
. O

After O
outbreak O
of O
the O
revolution O
on O
25 O
August O
1957 O
the O
couple O
emigrated B-TER
legally O
to O
London B-LOC
as O
they O
had O
a O
passport B-TER
. O

As O
they O
received O
some O
money B-TER
from O
the O
USA B-LOC
this O
helped O
them O
during O
the O
initial O
period O
. O

Now O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
weaves O
scarves O
here O
for O
sale O
, O
using O
a O
small O
hand O
weaving O
machine O
which O
he O
himself O
has O
invented O
and O
which O
he O
plans O
to O
have O
patented O
. O

Mrs O
Fábri B-PER
is O
currently O
working B-TER
part O
- O
time O
. O

As O
his O
foot O
is O
completely O
crippled O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
shot O
in O
the O
foot O
while O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
the O
affected O
leg O
is O
also O
much O
thinner O
, O
Mr O
Fábri B-PER
can O
not O
do O
any O
work B-TER
that O
involves O
standing O
. O

Without O
his O
orthopaedic B-TER
shoes I-TER
he O
can O
not O
walk O
at O
all O
and O
is O
thus O
extremely O
handicapped O
. O

Mr O
Fábri B-PER
told O
me O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
their O
decision O
to O
emigrate B-TER
was O
that O
as O
former O
capitalists O
they O
believed O
they O
were O
again O
in O
danger O
and O
therefore O
preferred O
to O
go O
to O
a O
free B-TER
country I-TER
. O

: O
As O

I O
learned O
on O

1944 O
that O
the O
GermanSSdoctor O
Dr O
Kausch O
was O
performing O
vivisection O
experiments O
on O

prisoners O
. O

One O
day O
I O
was O
able O
to O
gain O
access O
to O
a O
hospital O
room O
. O

To O
my O
immense O
surprise O
I O
saw O
Nikolaus O
Fábri O
there O
and O
he O
told O
me O
that O
vivisection O
experiments O
were O
being O
performed O
on O
his O
feet O
and O
arms O
and O
also O
internally O
. O

Wounds O
on O
his O
body O
, O
feet O
and O
arms O
had O
been O
created O
by O
infection O
, O
which O
began O
to O
fester O
after O
a O
short O
time O
. O

These O
experiments O
were O
extremely O
painful O
. O

Fábri O
was O
also O
inoculated O
with O
malaria O
bacilli O
. O

He O
was O
given O
Atebrin O
pastilles O
to O
try O
to O
treat O
the O
resulting O
malaria O
. O

Fábri O
had O
to O
repeatedly O
take O
25 O
pastilles O
. O

These O
various O
experiments B-TER
were O
– O
to O
my O
knowledge O
– O
continued O
until O
the O
evacuation B-TER
of O

the O

settled O
in O
the O

, O
frequently O
they O
would O

very O

it O
would O

I O
, O
my O

my O
two O

My O

was O
living O
at O

in O

I O
called O

[ O
to O
ask O
] O
that O
he O
should O
send O
a O

, O
and O
so O
I O
arrived O
in O
Bełżyce B-LOC

In O
Bełżyce B-LOC
I O
gathered O
together O
a O
few O
people B-TER

organized O
a O
[ O
public O

where O
the O
deportees B-TER
and O
the O
poor O
people B-TER
of O
Bełżyce B-LOC
would O
come O
to O
eat O
. O

We O
fed B-TER
around O
1200 O

1500 O
people B-TER

Also O
here O
I O
want O
to O
relate O
to O
what O
extent O
the O
German B-TER
regime I-TER
was O
rotten O
, O
that O
we O
could O
persuade O
the O
most O
important O
among O
them O
of O
anything O
for O
[ O
the O
price O
of O
] O
gold B-TER

Near O
us O
was O
Standartenführer B-PER

we O
could O
bribe B-TER
him O
with O
hard O
/ O
heavy O
gold O

as O
well O
as O
fabric O

– O
redeeming O
Jews O
from O
the O

of O
Józefów B-LOC
near O
Pulawy B-LOC
, O
not O
far O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
– O
from O
death B-TER
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
Jewish B-TER
representatives I-TER
, O
such O
as O
Dr. B-PER
Feltscher I-PER
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
men O
Kranbuegel B-PER
and O
Engel B-PER
, O
who O
were O
considered O
the O
most O
famous O
camp B-TER
directors I-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
– O
until O
1942 O
we O
were O
able O
for O
various O
prices O
to O
ensure O
that O
no O
ghetto B-TER
or O
camp B-TER
would O
be O
established O
in O
our O
city O
( O
Bełżyce B-LOC
) O
. O

Nevertheless O
in O
1942 O
, O
in O
the O
eighth O
month O
, O
a O
Jewish O
quarter O
[ O
city O
] O
was O
established O
in O
our O
town O
. O

They O
gathered B-TER
all O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
entire O
Lublin B-LOC
district O
– O
they O
deceived O
them O
and O
told O
them O
to O
bring O
everything O
with O
them O
– O
it O
was O
pitiful O
to O
see O
how O
the O
Jews O
even O
dragged O
with O
them O
wood O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
with O
us O
in O
Bełżyce B-LOC
were O
gathered B-TER
together O
around O
9000 O
Jews O
. O

They O
allowed O
them O
to O
rest O
for O
three O
days O
– O
on O
the O
third O
day O
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
man O
inspector O
Engel B-PER
entered O
the O
Jewish O
quarter O
– O
this O
was O
a O
beast O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
man B-TER
– O
straight O
away O
in O
the O
square O
he O
murdered B-TER
700 O
people B-TER
– O
the O
rest O
were O
taken O
away O
to O
Bełżec B-LOC
near O
Tomaszów B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
burned B-TER
them O
in O
the O
crematoria B-TER
. O

There O
remained O
Jews O
in O
hiding B-TER
, O
who O
had O
hidden B-TER
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
surrounding O
forests O
and O
came O
back O
after O
the O
aktion B-TER
– O
around O
600 O
persons B-TER
. O

From O
these O
people B-TER
a O
camp B-TER
was O
created O
in O
Bełżyce B-LOC

The O

The O

to O
work B-TER
for O

three O

no O

At O
the O

they O
took O
them O

Naturally O
, O
they O
did O
not O
tell O
them O
that O
they O
were O
being O
taken O
there O
to O
be O
murdered B-TER

rather O
to O
work B-TER

And O
indeed O
, O
on O
the O
second O
day O
they O
took O
them O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
shtetl O

They O
even O
started O
repairing O
the O
barracks B-TER
in O
Poligon B-LOC

At O
the O

time O
, O
they O
started O
setting O
free O
Jews O
from O
the O
city O
of O
Švenčionys B-LOC
as O
useful O
Jews O
. O

This O
reinforced O
the O
hope O
among O
everyone O
that O
they O
would O
let O
them O
live O
, O
because O
each O
useful O
Jew O
, O
that O
is O
a O
shoemaker O
, O
a O
tailor O

a O
doctor O

. O

to O

to O

On O
October O

, O
the O
bandits O
selected B-TER
the O
strongest O
men B-TER
for O
work O

They O
did O
not O
come O
back O
, O

at O
the O

time O
by O
the O
door O
they O
stopped O
letting O
out O
the O
Jews O
who O
were O
recognized O

At O
the O

time O
they O
drove O
[ O

to O
Poligon B-LOC

New O
Švenčionys B-LOC

dig O

there O
in O

the O

already O
knew O

the O

strongly O
guarded B-TER

They O
covered O
the O
graves B-TER
a O
bit O
with O
earth O
and O
left O
them O
almost O
open O
until O
the O
month O
of O
April O
, O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
martyrs O
forced O
its O
way O
through O
the O
white O
and O
yellow O
sand O
and O
in O
a O
few O
places O
the O
wolves O
, O
of O
which O
there O
are O
many O
in O
the O
district O
, O
ate O
a O
number O
of O
bodies B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
April O
they O
brought O
Jewish O
workers B-TER
from O
the O
Vilna O
ghetto O
and O
they O
covered O
the O
graves B-TER
with O
( O
slaked O
lime O
) O
chalk B-TER
and I-TER
a I-TER
thick I-TER
layer I-TER
of I-TER
earth I-TER
and O
the O
place O
was O
fenced O
off O
. O

At O
first O
there O
were O
around O
sixty O
Jewish O
workers B-TER
who O
, O
after O
finishing O
their O
work B-TER
at O
Poligon O
, O
they O
were O
occupied O
with O
chopping O
wood O
and O
working B-TER
on O
the O
railway O
line O
. O

In O
a O
short O
time O
, O
around O
the O
end O
of O
May O
1942 O
, O
they O
brought O
new O
workers B-TER
from O
Švenčionys B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

There O
were O
already O
more O
than O
a O
hundred O
workers B-TER
laboring B-TER
there O
. O

This O
lasted O
until O
the O
end O
of O
March O
1943 O
. O

Then O
they O
sent O
them O
all O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
of I-LOC
Švenčionys I-LOC
and O
they O
divided O
the O
entire O
ghetto B-TER
into O
two O
groups O
: O
in O
one O
group O
were O
those O
with O
friends O
or O
relatives O
in O
Vilna B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
sent O

Vilna B-LOC
. O

The O
two O
groups O
were O
taken O
to O
… O
Kovno B-LOC

And O
leaving O
Vilna B-LOC
they O
took O
them O
a O
few O
kilometers O
to O
Poligon O
and O
opened O
the O
wagons B-TER
. O

Then O
the O
people B-TER
straight O
away O
understood O
to O
where O
they O
had B-TER
been I-TER
taken I-TER
. O

They O
began O
shooting B-TER
with O
machine O
guns O
, O
all O
were O
murdered B-TER
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
who O
saved O
themselves O
in O
that O
moment O

Autobiography O
from O
the O
Time O
of O
the O
German B-TER
Occupation I-TER
When O
the O
war B-TER
broke O
out O
in O
1939 O
, O
I O
was O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
( O
Poland B-LOC
) O
. O

In O
the O
ninth O
month O
[ O
September O
] O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

The O
day O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered B-TER
the O
city O
it O
became O
a O
hell O
. O

Immediately O
, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
decrees B-TER
were O
issued O
stating O
that O
the O
Jews O
must B-TER
not I-TER
walk I-TER
down O
the O
main O
streets O
and O
Jewish O
businesses O
must O
display B-TER
a I-TER
label I-TER
with O
a O
yellow B-TER
Star I-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
. O

Then O
they O
seized B-TER
[ O
people B-TER
] O
for O
labor B-TER
from O
every O
house O
and O
they O
gave O
Jews O
the O
hardest O
work O
. O

Then O
they O
again O
made O
a O
decree B-TER
that O
Jews O
must O
wear O
yellow B-TER
patches I-TER
; O
this O
allowed O
people B-TER
to O
identify O
who O
is O
a O
Jew O
and O
then O
they B-TER
beat I-TER
us I-TER
terribly O
on O
the O
streets O
so O
that O
indeed O
no O
one O
could O
go O
out O
in O
the O
street O
. O

Thus O
my O
family B-TER
decided O
to O
leave O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

After O
four O
months O
we O
all O
left O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
because O
they O
made O
a O
terrible O
ghetto B-TER
, O
for O
Połaniec B-LOC
( O
Kielce B-LOC
region O
, O
Poland B-LOC
) O
, O
my O
grandmother B-TER
lived O
there O
in O
the O
shtetl O
and O
we O
all O
lived O
with O
her O
. O

We O
began O
a O
new O
life O
there O
. O

It O
was O
better B-TER
for O
us O
than O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

My O
father B-TER
began O
to O
trade O
and O
made O
a O
living O
. O

And O
so O
two O
years O
passed O
; O
not O
so O
calmly O
, O
there O
were O
various O
deportations B-TER
in O
a O
small O
format O
. O

SS B-ORG
men B-TER
fell O
upon O
the O
shtetl O
and O
constantly O
took O
a O
few O
people B-TER
. O

Once O
we O
heard O
in O
the O
shtetl O
the O
news O
that O
the O
entire O
shtetl O
was O
to O
be O
liquidated B-TER
. O

My O
father B-TER
and O
mother B-TER
decided O
to O
give O
me O
to O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
and O
they O
would O
pay O
her O
. O

Once O
, O
in O
the O
ninth O
month O
of O
1942 O
, O
when O
my O
family B-TER
was O
hidden B-TER
in O
a O
bunker B-TER
made O
especially O
as O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
which O
my O
father B-TER
had O
built O
— O
I O
knew O
the O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
but O
I O
did O
not O
know O
how O
it O
looked O
— O
one O
morning O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
came O
to O
us O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
dressed B-TER
me O
nicely O
and O
did O
not O
give O
me O
any O
food B-TER
, O
only O
money O
, O
because O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
was O
to O
look O
after O
me O
in O
return O
for O
money O
. O

You O
can O
not O
imagine O
how O
the O
parting O
from O
my O
parents B-TER
was O
, O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
it O
my O
entire O
life O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
I O
can O
not O
write O
it O
down O
. O

With O
sadness O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
my O
parents B-TER
, O
but O
then O
something O
happened O
and O
, O
with O
God O
’s O
help O
, O
I O
met O
my O
family B-TER
again O
. O

I O
left O
home O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
and O
we O
needed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
village O
there O
where O
this O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
lived O
. O

When O
we O
had O
already O
gone O
three O
kilometers O
and O
were O
in O
a O
forest O
, O
she O
said O
that O
she O
needed O
to O
take O
care O
of O
something O
and O
must O
go O
away O
for O
ten O
minutes O
. O

And O
so O
I O
waited O
for O
her O
and O
waited O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
she O
was O
not O
coming O
back O
and O
I O
understood O
that O
she O
had O
taken O
the O
money O
and O
would O
not O
return O
. O

She O
had B-TER
made I-TER
a I-TER
run I-TER
for O
it O
. O

It O
was O
already O
nighttime O
when O
I O
came O
out O
of O
the O
forest O
and O
found O
myself O
standing O
in O
a O
field O
where O
shepherds B-TER
were O
herding O
their O
animals O
and O
taking O
them O
home O
. O

They O
did O
not O
identify O
me O
as O
a O
Jew O
when O
I O
went O
up O
to O
them O
, O
and O
I O
asked O
them O
where O
is O
the O
way O
to O
Połaniec B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
showed O
me O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Then O
I O
found O
the O
bunker B-TER
where O
my O
parents B-TER
and O
family B-TER
were O
hiding B-TER
. O

I O
called O
out O
, O
Mother O
, O
because O
I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
the O
entrance O
was O
to O
get O
inside O
the O
bunker B-TER
. O

They O
were O
very O
shocked O
to O
see O
me O
and O
I O
too O
was O
surprised O
seeing O
the O
bunker B-TER
where O
we O
would O
have O
to O
live O
for O
we O
did O
not O
know O
how O
long O
. O

This O
was O
in O
a O
stable B-TER
, O
under O
the O
hay O
and O
under O
the O
earth O
. O

It O
was O
a O
pit O
lined O
with O
boards O
: O
its O
height O
maybe O
be O
one O
meter O
and O
its O
breadth O
three O
meters O
. O

On O
the O
floor O
was O
spread O
out O
bedding O
and O
we O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
bedding O
because O
it O
was O
impossible B-TER
to I-TER
stand I-TER
up I-TER
. O

The O
owner O
of O
the O
stable O
took O
payment O
of O
4500 O
zlotys O
per O
month O
. O

At O
night O
my O
father B-TER
went O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
to O
bring O
the O
water B-TER
and O
food B-TER
which O
the O
farmer B-TER
prepared O
in O
advance O
, O
and O
so O
it O
was O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
life O
in O
the O
bunker B-TER
. O

However O
, O
after O
a O
while O
the O
farmer B-TER
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
risk O
buying O
food B-TER
for O
us O
anymore O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
onwards O
began O
for O
us O
the O
worst O
and O
bitterest B-TER
time I-TER
of O
life O
and O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
my O
father B-TER
was O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
supply O
of O
food B-TER
ran O
out O
and O
we O
were O
left O
without O
hope O
. O

My O
father B-TER
went O
out O
every O
night O
to O
get O
food B-TER
. O

However O
, O
he O
now O
did O
not O
bring O
bread B-TER
but O
only O
raw O
potatoes B-TER
, O
cabbage B-TER
leaves O
, O
onions B-TER
, O
and O
so O
we O
lived O
from O
this O
the O
entire O
year O
of O
1943 O
and O
the O
first O
half O
of O
1944 O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
suffered O
very O
much O
with O
her O
stomach O
and O
it O
pained O
her O
very O
much O
and O
she O
was O
very O
sick B-TER
. O

My O
little O
brother B-TER
somehow O
hung O
on O
, O
as O
did O
I. O
My O
father B-TER
said O
nothing O
but O
it O
was O
clear O
from O
Father B-TER
’s O
face O
that O
he O
suffered O
very O
much O
from O
hunger B-TER
and O
also O
morally O
: O
it O
pained O
him O
greatly O
that O
he O
could O
not O
help O
us O
and O
he O
did O
his O
best O
to O
help O
us O
. O

The O
hunger B-TER
and O
cold B-TER
made O
us O
very O
dispirited O
and O
we O
saw O
no O
end O
to O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
on O
June O
25 O
, O
1944 O
, O
my O
father B-TER
went O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
at O
night O
thinking O
that O
he O
would O
go O
to O
another O
village O
five O
kilometers O
way O
and O
there O
he O
would O
buy O
bread B-TER
, O
because O
my O
mother B-TER
could O
no O
longer O
eat O
the O
cabbage B-TER
leaves O
. O

He O
went O
and O
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

I O
cried O
the O
whole O
night O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
began O
to O
feel O
much O
worse O
and O
we O
had O
no O
news O
about O
my O
father B-TER
. O

So O
I O
said O
to O
my O
little O
brother B-TER
that O
he O
should O
go O
and O
find O
out O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
father B-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
went O
out O
and O
came O
back O
and O
told O
us O
he O
heard O
that O
our O
father B-TER
had O
been O
caught O
by O
the O
farmers B-TER
; O
what O
they O
did O
with O
him O
I O
do O
not O
know O
to O
this O
day O
. O

We O
cried O
day O
and O
night O
but O
father B-TER
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

However O
, O
our O
luck O
had O
already O
evaporated O
, O
as O
bread O
always O
falls O
on O
the O
buttered O
side O
. O

After O
two O
months O
the O
farmer B-TER
who O
owned O
the O
bunker B-TER
came O
to O
us O
and O
spoke O
to O
us O
in O
this O
way O
: O
The O
Russians O
have O
torn O
through O
the O
front O
and O
the O
Germans O
are O
fleeing O
and O
searching O
all O
homes O
and O
fields O
. O

Therefore O
I O
am O
afraid O
to O
hide O
you O
anymore O
. O

And O
he O
told O
us O
that O
we O
should O
give O
him O
money O
and O
he O
would O
take O
us O
into O
a O
deep O
forest O
where O
we O
could O
hide B-TER
ourselves O
and O
he O
would O
help O
us O
. O

And O
we O
listened O
to O
him O
and O
we O
had O
no O
other O
counsel O
. O

So O
the O
next O
day O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
it O
was O
still O
very O
dark O
, O
he O
rode O
up O
to O
the O
bunker B-TER
in O
a O
wagon O
and O
we O
came O
out O
from O
the O
hidden B-TER
bunker I-TER
. O

Going O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
we O
could O
not O
stand O
on O
our O
feet O
and O
all O
three O
of O
us O
went O
onto O
the O
wagon O
. O

Together O
with O
my O
brother B-TER
I O
carried O
my O
mother B-TER
to O
the O
wagon O
, O
because O
she O
was O
very O
weak O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
off O
. O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
travelling O
we O
reached O
some O
water O
. O

The O
wagon O
stopped O
and O
he O
told O
us O
to O
get O
off O
the O
wagon O
. O

By O
the O
water O
stood O
the O
farmer B-TER
’s I-TER
brother I-TER
. O

And O
then O
began O
a O
terrible O
scene O
which O
I O
will O
never O
in O
my O
life O
forget O
. O

He O
quickly O
pulled O
her O
[ O
my O
mother B-TER
] O
down O
murderously O
and O
threw O
her O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
he O
beat O
me O
severely O
, O
and O
then O
my O
little O
brother B-TER
. O

But O
in O
the O
blink O
of O
an O
eye O
I O
tore O
myself O
from O
his O
hands O
and O
sprang O
into O
the O
water O
. O

I O
began O
walking O
in O
the O
water O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

It O
became O
dark O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
strength O
to O
go O
on O
. O

With O
my O
last O
strength O
I O
barely O
managed O
to O
run O
across O
. O

I O
went O
on O
without O
stopping O
for O
5–6 O
kilometers O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
other O
village O
. O

There O
I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
first O
, O
best O
farmer B-TER
, O
banged O
on O
the O
door O
and O
went O
in O
and O
begged O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
that O
was O
there O
inside O
, O
telling O
her O
that O
I O
was O
from O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
and O
when O
the O
Russians B-TER
invaded O
I O
fled O
. O

I O
asked O
that O
she O
should O
take O
me O
in O
to O
tend O
to O
the O
livestock O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
had O
mercy O
on O
me O
and O
she O
took O
me O
in O
and O
I O
worked B-TER
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
it O
was O
good O
for O
me O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
treated O
me O
well O
, O
like O
her O
own O
child B-TER
. O

But O
one O
day O
the O
same O
farmer B-TER
who O
killed B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
and O
little O
brother B-TER
, O
he O
must O
have O
found O
out O
that O
I O
was O
there O
, O
and O
he O
told O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
that O
I O
was O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
and O
communist B-TER
and O
she O
must O
not O
keep O
me O
. O

When O
he O
said O
this O
to O
her O
in O
one O
room O
, O
I O
heard O
it O
all O
from O
another O
room O
. O

Hearing O
this O
, O
I O
was O
very O
frightened O
that O
she O
would O
hand O
me O
in O
and O
I O
fled O
through O
the O
other O
door O
. O

I O
fled O
without O
even O
stopping O
to O
breathe O
, O
until O
I O
came O
to O
another O
village O
. O

And O
there O
I O
went O
to O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
. O

I O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
and O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

But O
I O
was O
not O
there O
for O
long O
and O
finally O
the O
Russians B-TER
came O
to O
the O
village O
and O
I O
was O
liberated B-TER
. O

But O
sadly O
alone O
. O

The O
day O
of O
happiness O
was O
August O
2 O
, O
1944 O
. O

After O
spending O
a O
few O
weeks O
in O
the O
village O
I O
saw O
how O
the O
Poles B-TER
were O
killing B-TER
Jews I-TER
after O
the O
liberation B-TER
. O

: O
On O
May O
25 O
, O
1943 O
, O
we O
were O
twenty O
people B-TER
, O
among O
them O
men B-TER

and O
three O
children B-TER
aged O

, O
lying O
hidden B-TER
in O
our O
house O
in O
a O

The O
Germans B-TER
discovered O
our O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
tore O
up O
the O
floor O
with O
iron O
bars O
, O
and O
managed O
to O
reach O
us O
: O
we O
tried O
to O
buy B-TER
our I-TER
lives I-TER
with O
money O
. O

We O
gave O
them O
gold O
and O
dollars O
to O
the O
value O
of O
200,000 O
Polish B-LOC

, O
they B-TER
took I-TER
the I-TER
money I-TER
and O
shot B-TER
a O
woman B-TER
and O
a O
man B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

I O
fled O
together O
with O
another O
two O
girls B-TER
. O

The O
remaining O
fifteen O
were O
taken O
and O
deported B-TER
. O

We O
found O
an O
open O
bunker B-TER
and O
went O
in O
. O

From O
there O
observed O
the O
aktion B-TER
. O

This O
was O
the O
last O
aktion B-TER
in O
our O
city O
. O

There O
were O
then O
in O
total O
5,000 O
Jews O
therein O
. O

We O
saw O
how O
at O
first O
the O
SS B-ORG
[ O
men O
] O
took O
the O
children B-TER
from O
the O
women B-TER
by O
force O
and O
drove O
them O
to O
the O
cemetery B-TER
, O
where O
they O
shot B-TER
them O
. O

The O
remaining O
people B-TER
, O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
, O
remained O
in O
the O
Politzei O
Sqaure O
on O
Piekarsga B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

This O
was O
a O
large O
square O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
city O
surrounded O
with O
walls O
; O
the O
Jewish B-TER
- I-TER
ghetto I-TER
police I-TER
was O
located O
there O
. O

In O
the O
square O
a O
selection B-TER
took O
place O
. O

Some O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
, O
around O
1,200 O
persons B-TER
, O
were O
shot B-TER
straight O
away O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
taken B-TER
away I-TER
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
and O
Majdanek B-LOC
. O

The O
aktion B-TER
continued O
in O
this O
way O
for O
three O
days O
. O

When O
the O
situation O
calmed O
, O
those O
in O
hiding B-TER
came O
out O
of O
their O
hiding B-TER
places I-TER
, O
among O
them O
also O
I O
and O
my O
mother B-TER
, O
who O
had O
hidden B-TER
in O
a O
different O
bunker B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
on O
May O
28 O
, O
we O
were O
caught O
by O
Germans B-TER
and O
Ukrainians B-TER
and O
deported B-TER
to O
Majdanek B-LOC

We O
were O
transported B-TER
in O
closed B-TER
wagons I-TER
, O
up O
to O
150 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

Arriving O
in O
Majdanek B-LOC
, O
a O
selection B-TER
took O
place O
. O

Old O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
went O
straight O
to O
the O
oven B-TER
, O
among O
them O
also O
my O
mother B-TER
. O

Children B-TER
also O
went O
directly O
with O
the O
elderly O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

I O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
among O
the O
healthy O
ones O
, O
who O
were O
taken O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Majdanek B-LOC
. O

The O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
was O
around O
250 O
meters O
from O
the O
place O
of O
the O
crematoria B-TER
and O
gas B-TER
ovens I-TER
. O

The O
daily O
schedule O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
as O
follows O
: O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
took O
place O
at O
3.30 O
AM O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
came O
out O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
barefoot B-TER
and O
stood O
in O
the O
frost B-TER
and I-TER
snow I-TER
until O
6 O
Am O
. O

We O
would O
drag O
out O
the O
sick B-TER
to O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
and O
lay O
them O
on O
blankets O
spread O
out O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

More O
than O
one O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
would O
beg O
for O
selection B-TER
so O
that O
he O
could O
go O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
putting O
an O
end O
to O
his O
suffering O
. O

For O
breakfast B-TER
they O
would O
give O
us O
to O
drink O
a O
bit O
of O
chamomile B-TER
[ O
brew O
] O
and O
this O
was O
our O
nourishment B-TER
until O

stand O
on O
our O
feet O
after O
an O
entire O
day O
at O
work B-TER
, O
sometimes O
three O
hours O
, O
because O
punishment O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
often O
took O
place O
and O
these O
lasted O
much O
longer O
due O
the O
beating B-TER
and O
killing B-TER
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
, O
only O
then O
did O
we O
receive O
80 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
ten O
grams O
of O
margarine B-TER
and O
black B-TER
coffee I-TER

was O
hard O
physical O
labor B-TER
, O
hacking O
stones O
, O
dragging O
brick O
boards O
and O
other O
physical O
labor B-TER

I O
was O
in O

for O
six O
weeks O
. O

On O
July O
16 O
, O
1943 O
, O
we O
healthy O
women B-TER

to O
Skarżysko B-LOC
- I-LOC
Kamienna I-LOC
near O
Radom B-LOC
in O
the O
Kielce B-LOC

There O
we O

was O
called O

PM O
. O

At O
4 O
AM O

marmalade B-TER

We O
made O
grenades O
and O
2 O
centimeter O
bullets O
. O

People B-TER
were O
often O
killed B-TER
by O
exploding O
material O
. O

Some O
became O
completely O
yellow O
due O
to O
the O
picric O
acid O
( O
such O
a O
material O
which O
is O
put O
into O
the O

. O

Selections B-TER
also O
took O
place O
. O

The O
weak O
would O
not O
be O
taken O
to O
crematoria B-TER
, O
since O
there O
were O
none O
, O
but O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
firing O

Out O
of O

among O

remained O

As O
the O
Russian B-TER
front O
neared O
, O
after O
we O
have O
been O
there O
fourteen O
months O
, O
in O
September O
1944 O
, O
we O
were O
evacuated B-TER
to O
Leipzig B-LOC
together O
with O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
. O

Also O
to O
an O
ammunition O
factory B-TER
, O
which O
was O
called O
SC O
ALE O
1 O
. O

There O
we O
worked B-TER
in O
somewhat O
better O
living B-TER
conditions I-TER
, O
however O
selections B-TER
took O
place O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
the O
weaker O
would O
be O
taken O
away O
and O
deported B-TER
, O
exactly O
to O
where O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

We O
were O
there O
for O
nine O
whole O
months O
. O

In O
April O
1945 O
, O
when O
the O
American B-TER
army I-TER
began O
to O
near O
Leipzig B-LOC
, O
they O
took O
us O
out O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
at O
night O
and O
, O
together O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
men O
, O
we O
started O
wandering B-TER
on O
foot O
over O
the O
fields O
and O
forests O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

There O
was O
already O
nowhere O
to O
evacuate B-TER
us O
to O
because O
the O
fire O
of O
war B-TER
had O
reached O
all O
corners O
of O
Germany B-LOC
, O
they O
dragged O
us O
around O
like O
this O
for O
three B-TER
weeks I-TER
. O

The O
250 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
, O
which O
they O
gave O
us O
when O
we O
left O
Leipzig B-LOC
, O
had O
already O
run O
out O
long O
ago O
, O
we O
would O
eat O
grass B-TER
and O
raw B-TER
potatoes I-TER
. O

When O
the O
Nazis O
noticed O
this O
, O
they O
would O
shoot B-TER
at O
us O
, O
and O
more O
than O
one O
person O
was O
killed B-TER
running O
to O
grab O
potatoes B-TER
or O
grass O
form O
a O
field O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
would O
warn O
the O
surrounding B-TER
peasants I-TER
that O
they O
should O
beware O
of O
the O
stoylayz O
, O
meaning O
the O
thieves O
that O
they O
were O
driving O
onwards O
. O

They O
took O
from O
Leipzig B-LOC
12,000 O
persons B-TER
. O

Seeing O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
wander O
around O
with O
such O
a O
large O
group O
, O
they O
divided O
us O
into O
[ O
smaller O
] O
groups O
and O
each O
group O
wandered B-TER
in O
a O
different O
direction O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
commandant I-TER
would O
drive O
around O
from O
group O
to O
group O
in O
a O
taxi O
, O
holding O
a O
map O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
wherever O
the O
Oberscharführer B-TER
would O
order O
, O
there O
they O
would O
take O
us O
. O

Usually O
these O
were O
places O
where O
the O
fire O
of O
war B-TER
was O
still O
a O
little O
way O
off O
. O

My O
group O
numbered O
4,000 O
women B-TER
, O
of O
which O
1,200 O
survived O
. O

Our O
group O
was O
mainly O
Jewish O
women B-TER
from O
Poland B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

So O
we O
walked B-TER
on I-TER
foot I-TER
for O

were O
moments O
in O
the O
Hasag B-LOC

labor B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Częstochowa B-LOC
when O
one O
thought O
that O
Jewish B-TER
life I-TER
had O
been O
completely O
extinguished O
. O

The O
tragic O
, O
daily O
events O
led O
to O
a O
depressing O
condition B-TER
among O
the B-TER
camp I-TER
inmates I-TER
. O

Despair O
, O

The O
political B-TER
news O
which O
reached O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
often O
painful O
and O
tragic O
. O

Every O
attempt O
at O
resistance B-TER
was O
put B-TER
down I-TER
, I-TER
suppressed I-TER

decimated I-TER

The O
German B-ORG
military I-ORG
forces I-ORG
achieved O
successes O
on O
the O
Eastern O

Some O
already O
lacked O
courage O
and O
patience O
for O
the O
long O
- O
enduring O
Jewish O
tragedy O
. O

In O
this O
situation O
, O
there O
were O
five O
people O
with O
a O
supernatural O
strength O
. O

They O
had O
the O
courage O
and O
daring O
to O
sing O
for O
their O
ill O
- O
fated O
brothers B-TER
and I-TER
sisters I-TER
, O
who O
numbered O
6,000 O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

They O
were O
two O
women B-TER
and O
three O
men B-TER
. O

With O
their O
singing B-TER
, O
they O
awoke O
a O
ray O
of O
hope O
for O
the O
future O
and O
a O
longing O
for O
the O
past O
. O

The O
songs B-TER
were O
for O
the O
most O
part O
sentimental O
and O
often O
called O
forth O
tears O
. O

The O
five O
were O
diverse O
in O
terms O
of O
repertoire O
and O
they O
sang B-TER
in O
three O
languages O
: O
Yiddish O

The O
singing B-TER
concerts I-TER
were O
held O
in O
various O
places O
in O
the O
camp B-TER

The O
biggest O
and O
most O
popular O
hall O
was O
the O
Tzirk O
Circus O
. O

It O
received O
this O
name O
because O
this O
was O
where O
all O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
a O
place O
to O
sleep O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
spent O
the O
night O

There O
all O
the O

The O
Tzirk O
was O
used O
for O
concerts B-TER

as O
a O
synagogue B-TER

The O
concerts B-TER
also O
took O
place O
in O
Hoffman O

shop O
and O
in O
barracks B-TER
seven O
and O
nine O
. O

The O
singing B-TER
was O
connected O

The O

Rosh B-TER
Hashana I-TER
and O
Yom B-TER
Kippur I-TER
he O
served O
as O
cantor O

These O
were O
the O
most O
tragic O
years O
for O
the O
people B-TER
of O
Częstochowa B-LOC
in O
the O
camp B-TER
of O
Hasag B-LOC

1943 O
and O
1944 O

Prayers B-TER
for O
the O
High O
Holy B-TER
Days I-TER
were O
held O
in O
such O
conditions B-TER
that O
they O
are O
unimaginable O
. O

It O
was O
more O
like O
fantasy O
, O
yet O
nevertheless O
it O
was O
a O
reality O
. O

The O
Tzirk O
was O
surrounded O
by O
guards B-TER
, O
who O
had O
to O
report O
if O
people B-TER
could O
pray B-TER
or O
not O
. O

Those O
praying B-TER
were O
the O
ones O
who O
left O
their O
work B-TER
places O
, O
left O
the O
machines O
, O
and O
came O
to O
pray B-TER
. O

According O
the O
German B-TER
conception O
, O
this O
was O
sabotage B-TER
and O
one O
would O
pay B-TER
for I-TER
it I-TER
with O
his O
life O
. O

The O
prayers B-TER
were O
accompanied O
by O
tragic O
crying O
from O
those O
present O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
in O
the O

camp B-TER
a O

away O
the O
pain O

of O

About O
my O
town O

Khmelnik B-LOC
[ O

Kielce B-LOC
I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
day O
. O

It O
was O
before O
Passover B-TER
in O
the O
year O
1943 O
, O
in O
the O
month O
of O
March O
, O
around O
five O
months O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
aktion B-TER
from O
our O
city O
. O

After O
the O
deportation B-TER
, O
there O
were O
almost O
forty O
of O
us O
left O
, O
and O
later O
there O
were O
only O
thirteen O
people B-TER
left O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
gendarmerie O
, O
hacking O
wood O
, O
sweeping O
, O
bringing O
water O
, O
scrubbing O
floors O
and O
cleanings O
things O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
it O
was O
my O
job O
to O
work B-TER
the O
garden O
, O
and O
on O
this O
basis O
we O
still O
remained O
. O

No O
Jew O
was O
allowed B-TER
to O
be O
in O
the O
town O
any O
longer O
, O
following O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
all O
our O
martyrs B-TER
, O
and O
of O
those O
remaining O
, O
from O
the O
forty O
people B-TER
, O
[ O
most O
] O
went O
to O
Kielce B-LOC
to O
the O
HASAG O
ammunition O
factory B-TER
, O
but O
we O
thirteen O
people B-TER
remained O
here O
for O
a O
while O
longer O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
. O

I O
was O
among O
those O
left O
behind O
, O
among O
the O
above O
mentioned O
workers B-TER
. O

Then O
the O
factory B-TER
from O
Kielce B-LOC
sent O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
workers B-TER
from O
the O
work B-TER
column O
to O
us O
in O
the O
town O
and O
other O
similar O
ones O
in O
the O
area O
for O
the O
potato B-TER
contingent O
for O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
because O
the O
factory B-TER
also O
produced O
potato B-TER
flakes I-TER
. O

Therefore O
Jewish O
worker B-TER
columns O
had O
to O
work B-TER
in O
difficult B-TER
conditions I-TER
, O
because O
before O
Pesach B-TER
, O
in O
the O
month O
of O
March O
, O
when O
one O
uncovers O
the O
trenches O
containing O
the O
potatoes B-TER
, O
there O
are O
winds B-TER
[ O
and O
] O
wet O
snow B-TER
which O
pierce O
the O
heart O
. O

But O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
Jews O
at O
that O
time O
was O
painted O
dark O
black O
and O
clouded O
over O
for O
the O
Jewish O
people B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
one O
beautiful O
day O
, O
the O
truck O
arrived O
to O
take O
potatoes B-TER
. O

It O
drove O
up O
to O
the O
one O
single O
house O
which O
was O
left O
of O
the O
Jewish O
ghetto B-TER
: O
for O
the O
thirteen O
people B-TER
remaining O
from O
the O
ten O
thousand O
Jews O
. O

You O
know O
it O
was O
my O
luck O
that O
then O
I O
had O
time O
to O
observe O
, O
because O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
garden O
: O
and O
why O
specifically O
did O
it O
drive O
up O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
thirteen O
people B-TER
? O
Because O
they O
had O
to O
pay B-TER
( O
pa O
blatu O
) O
protection O
money O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
security O
chief O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
thirteen O
people B-TER
were O
still O
not O
under O
barbed O
wire O
. O

And O
besides O
that O
, O
because O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
bring O
people B-TER
into O
the O
factory B-TER
from O
the O
city O
, O
some O
of O
them O
children B-TER
or O
wives B-TER
or O
brothers B-TER
or O
just O
family B-TER
[ O
of O
workers B-TER
] O
and O
so O
on O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
know O
the O
demons O
very O
well O
, O
and O
moreover O
my O
own O
child B-TER
then O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Therefore O
, O
when O
the O
freight O
wagons O
would O
come O
to O
the O
house O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
would O
immediately O
approach O
the O
wagon O
, O
because O
my O
nature O
was O
such O
and O
because O
we O
received O
signs O
from O
the O
people B-TER
, O
perhaps O
a O
few O
were O
coming O
. O

But O
maybe O
our O
brothers B-TER
and O
children B-TER
from O
the O
factory B-TER
wanted O
something O
and O
then O
they O
would O
secretly O
throw O
inside O
a O
bit O
of O
paper O
and O
write B-TER
something I-TER
that O
we O
should O
know O
what O
is O
going O
on O
with O
them O
. O

And O
we O
understood O
this O
and O
from O
this O
deduced O
what O
they O
want O
. O

Because O
writing O
was O
not O
allowed O
for O
the O
Jewish O
criminals O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
offenders O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
duty O
, O
to O
stay O
in O
touch O
with O
them O
so O
that O
no O
one O
should O
guess O
for O
what O
purpose O
I O
needed O
to O
approach O
the O
wagon O
. O

Yet O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
when O
, O
upon O
going O
to O
the O
wagon O
, O
I O
saw O
inside O
three O
little O
heads O
of O
helpless O
young O
boys B-TER
[ O
aged O
] O
around O
twelve O
or O
thirteen O
years O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
called O
Shufke O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
the O
other O
Solarz O
from O
Jędrzejów B-LOC
( O
Yendrev B-LOC
) O
, O
the O
third O
from O
Staszów B-LOC
( O
Stashev B-LOC
) O
, O
his O
name O
I O
can O
sadly O
no O
longer O
remember O
. O

And O
by O
them O
was O
standing O
a O
guard O
, O
an O
SS B-ORG
officer I-ORG
, O
he O
was O
called O
Vitok O
, O
the O
greatest O
enemy O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

My O
eyes O
should O
never O
see O
again O
such O
things O
as O
took O
place O
then O
. O

He O
was O
from O
the O
Leipzig B-LOC
HASAG B-LOC
factory B-TER
and O
had O
been O
dispatched O
to O
the O
Kielce B-LOC
HASAG B-LOC
factory B-TER
, O
he O
was O
leader O
of O
the O
work B-TER
commando O
. O

Then O
I O
go O
to O
him O
, O
because O
I O
had O
something O
to O
give O
him O
as O
a O
bribe B-TER
, O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
where O
the O
wagons O
were O
going O
today O
. O

He O
answers O
me O
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
Nowy B-LOC
Korczyn I-LOC
, O
that O
is O
Naystadt B-LOC
in O
Yiddish O
, O
near O
Wiślica B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
the O
poor O
sheep O
saw O
me O
talking O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
called O
me O
, O
with O
the O
words O
, O
Dear O
man O
, O
dear O
brother O
, O
and O
their O
eyes O
shone O
like O
the O
bright O
moon O
or O
the O
shining O
sun O
on O
a O
clear O
, O
beautiful O
day O
. O

And O
this O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
: O
[ O
they O
were O
] O
very O
clever O
and O
they O
understood O
something O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
pounded O
inside O
me O
. O

What O
is O
happening O
to O
them O
? O
Because O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
we O
always O
had O
the O
foreboding O
of O
[ O
… O
] O
, O
Word O
unclear O
. O

Being O
shot O
? O
Being O
killed O
? O
today O
them O
but O
tomorrow O
us O
, O
so O
people B-TER
who O
were O
more O
or O
less O
honest O
constantly O
thought O
. O

Then O
, O
when O
the O
brute O
went O
into O
our O
house O
, O
leaving O
a O
guard B-ORG
outside O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
children B-TER
with O
bread B-TER
, O
to O
give O
them O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

I O
give O
them O
the O
food B-TER
and O
the O
children B-TER
will O
not O
take O
it O
. O

However O
, O
they O
fall O
upon O
me O
and O
begin O
to O
kiss O
me O
, O
Dear O
Jew O
, O
beloved O
uncle O
, O
save O
us O
from O
danger O
. O

I O
ask O
them O
, O
with O
a O
choking O
heart O
throat O
? O
, O
What O
is O
happening O
to O
you O
dear O
children O
? O
They O
tell O
me O
that O
were O
selected O
from O
the O
factory B-TER
as O
the O
youngest O
and O
smallest O
, O
not O
capable O
of O
work B-TER
. O

They O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
dragging O
small O
carts O
with O
iron O
from O
one O
hall O
to O
the O
other O
. O

And O
today O
, O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
were O
woken O
up O
to O
leave O
, O
they O
do O
not O
know O
where O
they O
are O
going O
. O

But O
they O
heard O
that O
they O
are O
sending O
them O
to O
Naystadt B-LOC
to O
pack O
hay O
, O
because O
there O
are O
also O
a O
few O
Jews O
working B-TER
in O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
there O
, O
and O
they O
will O
work B-TER
there O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
. O

So O
strong O
were O
the O
minds O
of O
these O
poor O
children B-TER
. O

I O
remember O
how O
one O
begged O
me O
that O
I O
should O
give O
him O
a O
pencil O
: O
he O
wants O
to O
write B-TER
something I-TER
for O
his O
brother B-TER
who O
still O
remained O
working B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
in O
Kielce B-LOC
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
red O
from O
crying O
. O

Quiet O
and O
[ O
searching O
? O
] O
and O
clever O
, O
so O
that O
his O
cleverness O
shone O
forth O
from O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
he O
was O
called O
Shufke O
. O

So O
I O
give O
him O
my O
pencil O
, O
and O
he O
writes O
his O
farewell B-TER
letter I-TER
to O
his O
brother B-TER
in O
the O
wagon O
, O
off O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
that O
no O
one O
should O
notice O
what O
he O
is O
doing O
. O

And O
the O
other O
turns O
to O
me O
to O
consult O
with O
me O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
flee B-TER
, O
with O
such O
clever O
words O
he O
speaks O
to O
me O
that O
it O
reached O
the O
depths O
of O
my O
heart O
. O

But O
how O
can O
one O
stand O
hearing O
such O
clever O
children B-TER
? O
In O
truth O
, O
one O
would O
need O
to O
be O
made O
from O
steel O
to O
bear O
this O
, O
and O
to O
see O
the O
pitiful O
state O
of O
the O
poor O
, O
powerless O
sheep O
. O

And O
I O
, O
as O
an O
old O
man B-TER
, O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
is O
bursting O
inside O
me O
, O
and O
I O
raise O
my O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
and O
ask O
, O
Lord O
of O
the O
World O
, O
where O
are O
You O
and O
where O
am O
I O
? O
Why O
have O
you O
hidden O
Your O
mercy O
from O
such O
holy O
sheep O
? O
and O
I O
continue O
, O
If O
only O
I O
had O
gone O
with O
them O
, O
where O
my O
wife O
and O
children O
and O
where O
all O
my O
brothers O
and O
friends O
and O
all O
the O
Jews O
went O
, O
I O
would O
not O
see O
the O
crying O
and O
begging O
of O
the O
powerless O
children O
here O
. O

What O
do O
You O
want O
from O
me O
beloved O
God O
? O
In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
to O
see O
how O
they O
take O
the O
dearest O
of O
the O
people O
, O
completely O
innocent O
, O
for O
an O
offering O
. O

However O
, O
I O
calm O
myself O
and O
strengthen O
myself O
and O
ask O
them O
once O
again O
: O
Dear O
children O
, O
and O
kiss O
them O
one O
by O
one O
, O
What O
do O
you O
know O
that O
you O
are O
so O
scared O
? O
They O
tell O
me O
, O
like O
seventy O
- O
year O
- O
old O
men B-TER
, O
Why O
ask O
? O
Our O
hearts O
tell O
us O
that O
today O
is O
our O
last O
day O
in O
the O
beautiful O
, O
bright O
world O
. O

And O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
enjoyed O
the O
world O
and O
have O
done O
no O
wrong O
. O

And O
we O
must O
leave O
it O
so O
young O
, O
and O
our O
bones O
will O
decay O
in O
God O
’s O
earth O
so O
early O
. O

Cursed O
shall O
be O
the O
earth O
which O
will O
take O
our O
innocent O
blood O
. O

And O
my O
heart O
tears O
into O
pieces O
inside O
me O
, O
and O
I O
choke O
and O
can O
not O
speak O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
I O
wink O
to O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
he O
is O
still O
here O
today O
in O
the O
German B-TER
land I-TER
, O
his O
name O
is O
Fleishheker B-PER
, O
to O
give O
the O
murderer B-TER
schnapps B-TER
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

And O
I O
will O
talk O
a O
while O
longer O
with O
the O
pure O
little O
souls O
, O
And O
I O
go O
to O
them O
and O
ask O
, O
Why O
are O
you O
so O
afraid O
children O
? O
They O
answer O
me O
, O
We O
are O
not O
afraid O
of O
death O
. O

However O
, O
they O
continue O
, O
But O
tell O
us O
, O
will O
anyone O
remain O
and O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
the O
world O
the O
truth O
, O
that O
we O
were O
innocent O
, O
and O
where O
our O
bones O
will O
come O
to O
rest O
? O
Because O
they O
know O
already O
, O
that O
today O
them O
and O
tomorrow O
somebody O
else O
… O
. O

Dear O
God O
, O
who O
of O
us O
will O
remain O
? O
Who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
others O
about O
it O
and O
take O
revenge O
? O
One O
of O
them O
wants O
to O
run B-TER
from O
the O
wagon O
, O
but O
a O
guard O
stands O
there O
. O

I O
say O
to O
him O
, O
You O
see O
how O
they O
guard O
us O
. O

If O
you O
leave O
the O
vehicle O
, O
then O
he O
will O
shoot O
you O
. O

He O
says O
, O
I O
want O
that O
to O
happen O
, O
because O
perhaps O
then O
someone O
will O
remain O
who O
will O
know O
that O
my O
grave O
is O
here O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Chmelnik O
. O

I O
say O
to O
them O
, O
Wait O
, O
maybe O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
to O
go O
with O
you O
to O
Korczyn O
, O
and O
there O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
until O
I O
see O
what O
happens O
with O
you O
. O

This O
will O
be O
the O
sign O
: O
if O
we O
travel O
to O
Korczyn O
, O
then O
you O
are O
destined O
to O
live O
and O
stay O
there O
to O
work O
. O

And O
I O
calm O
the O
children B-TER
. O

And O
the O
other O
one O
gives O
me O
the O
letter B-TER
for O
his O
brother B-TER
in O
Kielce B-LOC
, O
that O
I O
should O
hide O
it O
until O
there O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
back O
with O
a O
wagon O
. O

And O
the O
workers B-TER
knew O
that O
they O
should O
search O
in O
the O
wagons O
, O
perhaps O
they O
will O
find O
something O
which O
brings O
news O
from O
outside O
the O
camp O
, O
Exodus O
13 O
: O
46 O
because O
they O
would O
also O
do O
so O
when O
they O
packed O
and O
sent O
away O
letters B-TER
to O
other O
Jews O
with O
the O
train O
line O
. O

Maybe O
someone O
will O
know O
about O
this O
. O

I O
take O
the O
letter B-TER
and O
go O
into O
the O
house O
to O
the O
great O
murderer B-TER
Vitok O
and O
begin O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
the O
children B-TER
. O

He O
explains O
to O
me O
openly O
that O
they O
are O
taking O
them O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Naystadt B-LOC
. O

But O
I O
must O
believe O
him O
. O

Then O
I O
ask O
him O
the O
question O
: O
for B-TER
another I-TER
liter I-TER
of O
schnapps B-TER
, O
maybe O
I O
can O
go O
with O
them O
? O
He O
answers O
me O
yes O
, O
but O
on O
one O
condition O
. O

I O
need O
permission O
from O
my O
gendarmerie B-TER
. O

So O
I O
go O
to O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
post O
, O
to O
the O
lieutenant O
. O

He O
was O
called O
Haas B-PER
Hans I-PER
from O
Cologne B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
plead O
with O
him O
, O
telling O
him O
that O
I O
have O
buried O
some O
gold B-TER
at O
my O
uncle B-TER
’s O
home O
and O
will O
maybe O
find O
it O
and O
then O
I O
will O
give O
him O
the O
golden O
calf O
. O

He O
gives O
me O
a O
note O
to O
travel O
with O
the O
murderer B-TER
. O

And O
we O
mount O
the O
wagon O
and O
depart O
. O

Arriving O
in O
Busk B-LOC
( O
Busko B-LOC
- I-LOC
Zdrój I-LOC
) O
, O
a O
town O
which O
lies O
in O
the O
middle O
between O
Chmelnik B-LOC
and O
Korczyn B-LOC
, O
he O
gets O
down O
and O
sobers O
up O
a O
bit O
and O
the O
guards O
watch O
the O
children B-TER
like O
a O
valuable O
jewel O
. O

In O
Busko B-LOC
- I-LOC
Zdrój I-LOC
he O
demands O
more O
schnapps B-TER
. O

Why O
? O
Because O
he O
is O
an O
honorable O
man O
, O
he O
is O
taking O
them O
to O
Korczyn B-LOC
. O

But O
there O
’s O
nothing O
to O
be O
done O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
meaning O
Maybe O
the O
schnapps B-TER
will O
redeem B-TER
the O
pure O
souls O
. O

I O
go O
with O
him O
to O
the O
tavern O
. O

No O
trace O
of O
a O
Jew O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
little O
district O
village O
. O

Only O
we O
four O
mice O
. O

And O
they O
look O
at O
us O
like O
we O
come O
from O
the O
other O
world O
. O

For O
five O
months O
they O
have O
seen O
no O
Jews O
and O
today O
, O
once O
again O
, O
these O
four O
mice O
. O

We O
truly O
quaked O
in O
fear O
, O
not O
because O
of O
the O
demons O
( O
Nazis O
) O
but O
rather O
because O
of O
the O
Poles B-TER
, O
they O
grumble O
Zhids O
, O
Zhids O
… O
However O
, O
I O
order O
them O
to O
pour O
schnapps B-TER
and O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
him O
. O

Dear O
Mr. O
Vitok O
explains O
to O
me O
about O
the O
three O
children B-TER
and O
why O
they O
took O
them O
out O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
I O
have O
a O
long O
talk O
with O
him O
. O

However O
, O
the O
evil O
one O
is O
so O
thoroughly O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
from O
drink O
that O
he O
always O
answered O
me O
the O
same O
. O

They O
are O
being O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Korczyn B-LOC
, O
to O
pack O
hay O
, O
because O
the O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
is O
very O
hard O
for O
them O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
these O
are O
young O
children B-TER
, O
and O
the O
factory B-TER
is O
not O
allowed O
to O
keep O
such O
children B-TER
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
factory B-TER
security O
director O
, O
Berger O
, O
sent O
them O
to O
do O
lighter O
work B-TER
. O

He O
calmed O
me O
because O
his O
tone O
accorded O
with O
his O
words O
. O

And O
then O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
children B-TER
and O
told O
them O
everything O
. O

However O
, O
hey O
would O
not O
be O
comforted O
, O
In O
Hebrew O
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
follow O
an O
exact O
Biblical O
verse O
. O

because O
they O
said O
that O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
any O
German B-TER
. O

And O
they O
thanked O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
and O
hoped O
that O
God O
would O
repay O
me O
. O

And O
again O
, O
back O
to O
my O
beloved O
children B-TER
, O
and O
they O
say O
again O
, O
Today O
us O
and O
tomorrow O
who O
knows O
which O
of O
the O
remaining O
few O
Jews O
? O
And O
who O
will O
comfort O
them O
and O
be O
able O
to O
comfort O
them O
? O
The O
writer O
of O
these O
lines O
can O
and O
will O
never O
forget O
this O
day O
. O

The O
words O
of O
the O
beloved O
young O
children B-TER
from O
a O
famous O
people B-TER
. O

We O
travel O
on O
to O
Korczyn B-LOC
and O
arrive O
in O
the O
city O
at O
11 O
AM O
. O

We O
approach O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
in O
Korczyn B-LOC
. O

We O
stop O
, O
and O
a O
few O
Jews O
who O
worked B-TER
there O
hacking O
wood O
and O
building O
walls O
for O
a O
house O
come O
outside O
and O
look O
at O
me O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
they O
see O
the O
three O
children B-TER
. O

I O
tell O
them O
the O
whole O
story O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
that O
it O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
hay O
here O
to O
pack O
for O
horses O
, O
because O
this O
place O
is O
by O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
and O
there O
is O
empty O
pasture O
land O
. O

However O
, O
they O
explain O
to O
me O
that O
it O
[ O
the O
work B-TER
] O
is O
not O
for O
children B-TER
, O
because O
it O
requires O
great O
strength O
. O

Then O
I O
continue O
standing O
there O
as O
though O
paralyzed O
, O
and O
I O
think O
to O
myself O
, O
the O
children B-TER
were O
indeed O
right O
. O

Yet O
nevertheless O
, O
perhaps O
something O
can O
be O
done O
for O
the O
children B-TER
. O

I O
approach O
these O
Jews O
, O
maybe O
they O
will O
know O
something O
. O

However O
, O
they O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
here O
are O
not O
so O
bad O
. O

I O
think O
maybe O
they O
will O
indeed O
do O
some O
work B-TER
with O
the O
hay O
: O
[ O
maybe O
] O
they O
intend O
for O
them O
to O
do O
the O
work B-TER
, O
thinking O
that O
the O
faster O
it O
will O
be O
finished O
, O
the O
sooner O
they O
can O
put O
an O
end O
to O
us O
. O

But O
I O
notice O
that O
no O
one O
approaches O
the O
three O
children B-TER
, O
rather O
they O
stand O
outside O
like O
dogs O
under O
guard O
. O

They O
have O
bread B-TER
but O
will O
not O
eat O
it O
. O

I O
go O
to O
them O
again O
and O
say O
, O
Eat O
something O
my O
children O
. O

They O
respond O
, O
We O
need O
no O
food O
already O
, O
we O
will O
never O
again O
demand O
any O
food O
or O
any O
work O
. O

It O
rips O
my O
heart O
and O
my O
thoughts O
afflict O
me O
: O
how O
are O
the O
children B-TER
so O
convinced O
of O
their O
truth O
? O
And O
they O
say O
to O
me O
again O
, O
We O
are O
not O
going O
to O
work O
here O
. O

Rather O
they O
are O
going O
to O
mow O
down O
our O
young O
lives O
. O

And O
the O
watchman B-TER
hears O
how O
the O
three O
swallows O
talk O
to O
me O
and O
turns O
away O
his O
face O
pretending O
not O
to O
see O
and O
hear O
how O
the O
pure O
young O
souls O
speak O
to O
me O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
he O
turns O
back O
to O
me O
and O
says O
, O
Go O
away O
! O
They O
do O
not O
need O
any O
food O
, O
with O
such O
sarcasm O
. O

Then O
I O
go O
off O
to O
the O
side O
so O
that O
no O
one O
will O
notice O
me O
and O
cry O
my O
heart O
out O
and O
say O
, O
Servants O
rule O
over O
us O
, O
Lamentations O
5:8 O
. O

and O
see O
how O
the O
black O
clouds O
are O
gathering O
above O
us O
. O

And O
I O
ask O
myself O
further O
, O
how O
does O
our O
wisdom O
help O
us O
, O
even O
that O
of O
three O
such O
young O
children B-TER
, O
when O
their O
foolish O
mind O
is O
prized O
now O
? O
The O
clock O
strikes O
. O

It O
is O
4 O
PM O
and O
we O
must O
begin O
the O
return O
journey O
. O

And O
they O
remain O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
move O
and O
am O
crazy O
, O
losing O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
my O
boss O
comes O
out O
and O
says O
to O
me O
that O
we O
must O
leave O
soon O
. O

We O
must O
stay O
a O
little O
and O
Vitok O
goes O
back O
inside O
and O
comes O
out O
from O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
white O
as O
chalk O
. O

Then O
I O
ask O
him O
, O
Mr. O
Vitok O
, O
why O
they O
are O
not O
taking O
the O
children O
to O
work O
as O
you O
told O
me O
? O
He O
takes O
the O
children B-TER
and O
leads O
them O
inside O
to O
the O
horse O
stables O
and O
says O
that O
they O
will O
directly O
be O
given O
light O
work B-TER
. O

And O
he O
calls O
me O
aside O
and O
orders O
me O
to O
prepare O
to O
return O
, O
but O
[ O
first O
] O
he O
wants O
another B-TER
schnapps B-TER
, O
what O
will O
one O
not O
do O
to O
save O
a O
life O
, O
what O
’s O
another O
schnapps B-TER
? O
I O
go O
off O
with O
him O
, O
and O
this O
was O
a O
pretense O
so O
that O
I O
should O
not O
see O
how O
they O
take O
them O
out O
to O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
. O

Returning O
with O
him O
, O
on O
the O
way O
I O
hear O
a O
few O
shots B-TER
, O
because O
the O
water O
of O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
is O
close O
to O
the O
city O
. O

We O
return O
to O
vehicle O
in O
which O
we O
must O
travel O
, O
which O
is O
standing O
in O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
yard O
, O
and O
a O
wagon O
arrives O
with O
three O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
who O
then O
go O
inside O
to O
the O
administrative O
office O
. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
Christian B-TER
wagon O
- O
driver O
and O
ask O
him O
what O
happened O
now O
, O
what O
were O
the O
few O
shots O
. O

He O
says O
to O
me O
, O
Do O
n’t O
you O
know O
? O
I O
took O
three O
little O
Zhids O
to O
the O
water O
and O
they O
were O
taken O
care O
of O
… O
Who O
are O
you O
? O
You O
’re O
not O
one O
of O
our O
Zhids O
. O

You O
’re O
a O
stranger O
, O
because O
you O
do O
n’t O
know O
our O
gendarme O
. O

He O
is O
called O
Gavenda O
, O
a O
Volksdeutsch O
, O
he O
is O
the O
best O
shooter O
. O

With O
this O
I O
ended O
my O
work B-TER
day O
. O

The O
wise O
children B-TER
, O
poor O
things O
, O
raised O
up O
their O
souls O
by O
the O
water O
, O
and O
no O
one O
knows O
, O
poor O
things O
, O
where O
their O
young O
bones O

which O
left O
the O
world O
so O
early O
and O
in O
an O
untimely O
manner O
, O
are O
decaying O
in O

I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
day O

I O
have O
many O
more O
poems B-TER

I O
composed O
but O
I O
have O
no O
paper O
to O
write O

but O
I O
will O
send O
to O
you O
also O
my O
experiences O
which O
I O
endured O
in O
eleven O
camps B-TER
and O
three O
ghettos B-TER
. O

My O
memories O
from O
February O
6 O
, O
1942 O
, O
to O
February O
7 O
, O
1947 O
. O

In O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
, O
only O
a O
few O
months O
after O
the O
Great O
Aktion B-TER
in O
which O
more O
than O
ten O
thousand O
of O
our O
dearest O
ones O
were O
taken B-TER
away I-TER
, O
on O
January O
25 O
, O
1941 O
, O
they O
again O
began O
talking O
about O
an O
action B-TER
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

Later O
the O
talk O
about O
sending O
600 O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
to O
Riga B-LOC
intensified O
. O

However O
, O
we O
knew O
what O
this O
meant O
for O
us O
and O
we O
began O
to O
hide B-TER
ourselves O
away O
in O
the O
hiding B-TER
places I-TER
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
the O
atmosphere O
calmed O
down O
again O
, O
and O
we O
gradually O
came O
out O
[ O
of O
the O
hiding B-TER
places I-TER
] O
. O

In O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
at O
that O
time O
they O
needed O
working B-TER
hands I-TER
for O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
aerodrome O
. O

So O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
went O
out O
onto O
the O
street O
I O
was O
caught O
and O
straight O
away O
sent O
to O
the O
work B-TER
at O
the O
aerodrome O
. O

That O
day O
there O
was O
a O
burning O
frost B-TER
which O
cut O
like O
knives O
, O
we O
all O
went O
out O
to O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
there O
was O
then O
a O
panic O
. O

They O
immediately O
slammed O
the O
doors O
with O
the O
bolts O
, O
no O
living O
soul O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
outside O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
policemen B-TER
. O

However O
, O
that O
day O
we O
did O
not O
work B-TER
in O
the O
aerodrome O
. O

We O
just O
stood O
and O
talked O
with O
one O
another O
about O
the O
good O
conduct O
of O
the O
guards B-TER
, O
how O
they O
did O
not O
herd O
us O
to O
work B-TER
as O
they O
did O
on O
all O
other O
occasions O
. O

Yet O
that O
day O
also O
passed O
slowly O
and O
sadly O
. O

When O
3.30 O
arrived O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
an O
order O
to O
lay O
down O
the O
axes O
and O
spades O
and O
the O
working B-TER
day O
was O
over O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
way O
we O
directly O
found O
out O
that O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
something O
bad O
had O
happened O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
know O
what O
. O

Close O
to O
the O
door O
they O
arranged O
us O
in O
rows B-TER
of O
twenty O
men B-TER
. O

Opposite O
the O
Work O
Office O
and O
in O
the O
square O
stood O
the O
commandant B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
ghetto I-TER
, O
Jordan B-PER
, O
with O
his O
retinue O
and O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Labor O
Office O
Lurie O
and O
Arenshtam B-PER
and O
the O
Jewish O
police B-TER
, O
and O
they O
herded O
us O
straight O
into O
through O
a O
fenced O
wire O
gate O
, O
a O
few O
people B-TER
straight O
away O
tried O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

However O
, O
immediately O
a O
few O
shots O
rang O
out O
and O
they O
took O
us O
straight O
to O
the O
kloyz O
small O
synagogue O
or O
study O
house O
. O

They O
beat O
us O
with O
the O
rifles O
and O
they O
filled O
the O
kloyz O
with O
people B-TER
so O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
breath O
; O
really O
we O
were O
suffocating O
. O

Immediately O
, O
Jewish O
policemen B-TER
came O
and O
took O
out O
their O
people B-TER
. O

Later O
, O
the O
Jewish O
police B-TER
came O
again O
and O
it O
became O
bitter O
and O
dark O
for O
us O
, O
the O
black B-TER
trade I-TER
began O
– O
how O
much O
will O
you O
give O
, O
you O
get O
out O
straight O
away O
, O
five O
golden O
coins O
and O
a O
golden O
watch O
and O
the O
deal O
is O
done O
, O
hand O
it O
over O
. O

And O
now O
take O
an O
armband O
and O
a O
police O
hat O
and O
follow O
him O
out O
. O

And O
so O
it O
went O
on O
, O
and O
we O
still O
remained O
in O
the O
kloyz O
. O

A O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
was O
conducted O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
they O
seized O
more O
people B-TER
because O
they O
had O
not O
reached O
the O
required O
number O
due O
to O
the O
police B-TER
letting O
half O
the O
people B-TER
go O
for B-TER
gold I-TER
and I-TER
money I-TER
, O
with O
the O
agreement O
of O
the O
Labor O
Office O
, O
at O
its O
head O
Lurie B-PER
and O
Arenshtam B-PER
, O
nicknamed O
the O
Hunderter O
[ O
the O
hundred O
] O
or O
Mapu O
. O

Yet O
the O
number O
had O
been O
reached O
by O
7 O
P.M. O
, O
and O
they O
arranged O
us O
again O
in O
front O
of O
the O
commandant B-TER
in O
rows O
of O
twenty O
men B-TER
and O
march O
. O

A O
few O
shots O
, O
childish O
cries O
, O
and O
the O
wails O
of O
women B-TER
were O
heard O
. O

We O
walked O
and O
we O
thought O
they O
were O
taking O
us O
to O
the O
Ninth B-LOC
Fort I-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
commandant B-TER
assured O
us O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
afraid O
: O
we O
were O
going O
to O
work B-TER
and O
not O
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
people B-TER
in O
Kovno B-LOC
would O
yet O
be O
jealous O
of O
us O
. O

We O
would O
forthwith O
be O
able O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
to O
our O
families B-TER
. O

But O
promises O
and O
love O
[ O
maybe O
: O
being O
nice O
] O
do O
not O
cost O
money O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

We O
were O
well O
acquainted O
with O
German B-TER
promises O
but O
could O
not O
help O
ourselves O
. O

So O
they O
took O
us O
in O
the O
direction O
of O

, O
and O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
in O
Schanz B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
loaded O
us O
into O
the O
wagons O
, O
forty O
men B-TER
to O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

Before O
they O
closed O
the O
wagons O
they O
gave O
us O
bread B-TER
with O
a O
purse O
of O
matches O
so O
that O
we O
could O
smoke O
and O
be O
quiet O
. O

And O
when O
they O
had O
loaded O
us O
into O
the O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
there O
were O
six O
hundred O
of O
us O
, O
including O
children B-TER
and O
women B-TER
; O
there O
were O
also O
a O
few O
volunteers O
like O
the O
crazy O
people B-TER
Galu O
and O
Mapu O
. O

This O
was O
February O
6 O
, O
1942 O
, O
and O
we O
left O
at O
midnight O
. O

The O
wagons O
were O
locked O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
train B-TER
started O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
station O
, O
immediately O
a O
few O
lads O
opened O
the O
windows O
and O
doors O
and O
a O
series O
of O
people B-TER
began O
jumping B-TER
through O
the O
doors O
and O
windows O
. O

From O
my O
wagon O
twelve O
people B-TER
jumped B-TER
out O
straight O
away O
; O
from O
another O
wagon O
there O
jumped B-TER
out O
seventeen O
persons B-TER
and O
in O
Jonava B-LOC
( O
Yanov B-LOC
) O
and O
near O
Šiauliai B-LOC
( O
Shavel B-LOC
) O
also O
a O
few O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
. O

I O
myself O
also O
wanted O
to O
jump B-TER
out I-TER
. O

I O
was O
standing O
ready O
to B-TER
jump I-TER
when O
all O
at O
once O
I O
felt O
that O
someone O
was O
holding O
me O
by O
my O
coat B-TER
and O
a O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
voice O
calls O
out O
my O
name O
, O
Shane O
, O
I O
wo O
n’t O
let O
you O
jump O
, O
you O
stay O
here O
. O

I O
turn O
around O
, O
angry O
. O

It O
was O
a O
friend O
of O
my O
wife B-TER
, O
Sorel B-PER
Kabinsky I-PER
. O

And O
later O
I O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
jump B-TER
out I-TER
and O
continued O
on O
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
cold O
in O
the O
wagons O
and O
there O
was O
no O
water O
to O
drink O
, O
only O
dry O
bread B-TER
and O
it O
stank O
in O
the O
wagon O
because O
people B-TER
had O
to O
relieve O
their O
needs O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
by O
day O
and O
stood O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
the O
Šiauliai B-LOC
station O
. O

Jewish O
girls B-TER
from O
Šiauliai B-LOC
worked B-TER
at O
the O
station O
and O
they O
told O
us O
about O
the O
aktions B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

Thanks O
to O
them O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
icicles B-TER
to O
drink O
and O
bread B-TER
, O
and O
they O
were O
herded O
away O
from O
us O
so O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
with O
them O
. O

Later O
they O
opened O
our O
wagon B-TER
and O
we O
got O
some O
fresh O
air O
, O
relief O
from O
the O
stink O
, O
and O
we O
received O
money O
– O
17 O
marks O
in O
our O
wagon B-TER
. O

In O
other O
wagons B-TER
they O
received O
only O
12 O
marks O
. O

This O
was O
because O
our O
wagon O
had O
fewer O
people B-TER
in O
it O
after O
a O
lot O
had O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
. O

And O
so O
we O
travelled O
on O
further O
for O
two O
days O
and O
three O
nights O
until O
we O
reached O
Riga B-LOC
. O

There O
began O
my O
wandering O
through O
eleven O
camps B-TER
and O
( O
3 O
) O
three O
ghettos B-TER
and O
my O
experiences O
until O
today O
I O
will O
[ O
not O

will O
later O

Something O
seems O
to O
be O
missing O
here O
so O
that O
the O
sentence O
will O
make O
sense O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
will O
write O
more O
later O
. O

write O
to O
you O
because O
I O
do O
not O
have O
paper O
on O
which O
to O
write O
. O

And O
I O
attach O
here O
the O
poem B-TER
about O
February O
6 O
which O
I O
and O
another O
lad O
form O
Kovno B-LOC
composed O
in O
my O
café O
in O
the O
Riga B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

My O
café O
in O
the O
Riga B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
was O
the O
only O
one O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
with O
music B-TER
and O
artists B-TER
also O
sang O
there O
. O

I O
ask O
you O
, O
Mr. O
Editor O
, O
that O
you O
print O
it O
and O
improve O
the O
wording O
, O
that O
means O
edit O
it O
, O
and O
please O
excuse O
my O
bad O
handwriting O
because O
I O
am O
right O
handed O
[ O
but O
] O
I O
am O
sadly O
an O
invalid B-TER
, O
I O
am O
missing O
three O
half O
fingers O
from O
my O
right O
hand O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
I O
endured O
things O
that O
would O
fill O
volumes O
. O

We O
were O
among O
the O
first O
of O
those O
sent O
to O
Riga B-LOC
and O
only O
twelve O
of O
us O
remain B-TER
alive I-TER

In O

out O
, O
my O

I O

at O
home O
in O
the O
shtetl O
of O
Chortkiv B-LOC
– O
western O
Ukraine B-LOC

I O
survived O
innumerable O
slaughters B-TER
. O

The O
first O
Jewish O
victims B-TER
in O
our O
shtetl O
fell O
only O
a O
few O
days O
after O
the O
occupation B-TER
of O
our O
region O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

They O
ordered O
a O
few O
hundred O
Jewish O
men B-TER
to O
gather O
in O
a O
square O
– O
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
men B-TER
gathered O
in O
the O
square O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
taking O
them O
to O
work B-TER
, O
they O
took O
them O
to O
prison B-TER
, O
and O
later O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
together O
with O
the O
local B-TER
Ukrainians I-TER
, O
murdered B-TER
them O
in O
a O
brutal O
fashion O
. O

And O
they O
buried B-TER
some I-TER
alive I-TER
. O

These O
were O
the O
best O
people B-TER
from O
our O
city O
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
, O
we O
received O
news O
from O
my O
home O
town O
– O
Zalishchyky B-LOC
– O
five O
kilometers O
from O
us O
, O
where O
my O
parents B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
still O
lived O
, O
that O
the O
gestapo B-ORG
there O
had O
issued O
an O
order B-TER
: O
five O
hundred O
Jews O
should O
come O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
barracks I-TER
. O

If O
they O
would O
not O
heed O
the O
command O
, O
they O
would O
kill B-TER
all O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
shtetl O
. O

The O
order B-TER
was O
fulfilled O
and O
all O
five O
hundred O
Jews O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
place O
outside O
the O
city O
. O

They O
lined O
them O
up O
ten O
in O
a O
row O
, O
one O
behind O
the O
other O
, O
and O
each O
row O
was O
shot B-TER
with O
one O
bullet O
– O
obviously O
, O
from O
such O
shooting O
most O
were O
only O
wounded O
, O
and O
some O
were O
not O
even O
touched O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-TER
ignored O
this O
and O
buried B-TER
them I-TER
all I-TER
alive I-TER
. O

Among O
the O
victims B-TER
were O
my O
father B-TER
and O
my O
two O
younger O
sisters B-TER
– O
aged O
eighteen O
and O
twenty O
years O
old O
. O

In O
March O
1942 O
, O
they O
carried O
out O
among O
us O
in O
the O
shtetl O
the O
first O
formal O
slaughter B-TER
. O

And O
immediately O
after O
this O
they O
ordered B-TER
us O
to O
move O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
with O
my O
children B-TER
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
there O
were O
terrible O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
allow O
us O
to O
stay O
for O
long O
in O
one O
place O
. O

After O
only O
six O
weeks O
they O
sent O
me O
( O
together O
with O
my O
children B-TER
) O
, O
along O
with O
a O
group O
of O
women B-TER
, O
to O
Zalischyky B-LOC
. O

After O
laboring B-TER
three O
months O
in O
Zalischyky B-LOC
, O
in O
September O
1942 O
an O
order B-TER
arrived O
that O
the O
camp B-TER
there O
must O
be O
free B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
[ O
Judenrein B-TER
] O
. O

Then O
they O
sent O
us O
to O
Tovste B-LOC
( O
Toist B-LOC
) O
. O

Tovste B-LOC
was O
an O
assembly O
point O
for O
the O
murder B-TER
of O
Jews O
. O

And O
we O
arrived O
here O
exactly O
as O
they O
were O
carrying O
out O
an O
extermination B-TER
- O
aktion B-TER
. O

I O
managed O
to O
hide B-TER
, O
together O
with O
my O
children B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
rest O
for O
long O
: O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
’ O
time O
– O
it O
was O
exactly O
one O
day O
after O
Simchat B-TER
Torah I-TER
– O
there O
once O
again O
took O
place O
here O
a O
slaughter B-TER
, O
during O
which O
over O
2,000 O
Jews O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
panic O
in O
the O
city O
was O
terrible O
, O
because O
no O
one O
had O
imagined O
that O
so O
quickly O
, O
after O
such O
a O
short O
breathing O
space O
, O
another O
slaughter B-TER
would O
take O
pace O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
cellar O
, O
together O
with O
my O
children B-TER
and O
another O
seven O
people B-TER
, O
altogether O
there O
were O
ten O
of O
us O
. O

That O
winter O
we O
remained O
in O
Tovste B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
May O
1943 O
, O
there O
again O
took O
place O
here O
a O
great O
slaughter B-TER
. O

My O
family B-TER
, O
the O
three O
of O
us O
, O
hid B-TER
in O
an O
attack O
and O
thus O
survived O
. O

Lying O
here O
a O
few O
days O
, O
my O
younger O
child B-TER
seemed O
to O
understand O
the O
situation O
and O
did O
not O
even O
ask O
for O
water B-TER
. O

During O
the O
time O
in O
the O
attic B-TER
we O
heard O
heart O
- O
rending O
cries O
, O
screams O
, O
and O
calls O
for O
help O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
victims B-TER
fled B-TER
, O
but O
the O
local B-TER
population I-TER
– O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
– O
chased O
after O
them O
, O
beat O
them O
, O
and O
later O
murdered B-TER
them O
in O
a O
terrible O
fashion O
. O

Those O
few O
Jews O
who O
remained O
alive O
, O
in O
hiding B-TER
, O
were O
later O
sorted B-TER
: O
the O
older O
people B-TER
[ O
word O
missing O
] O
were O
sent O
to O
Chortkiv B-LOC
and O
the O
younger O
to O
the O
camps B-TER
. O

Together O
with O
my O
family B-TER
, O
I O
stole B-TER
out I-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
night O
and O
alone O
we O
set O
out O
for O
Lysivtsi B-LOC
, O
seven O
kilometers O
from O
Tovste B-LOC
. O

For O
six O
weeks O
it O
was O
calm O
and O
then O
they O
again O
began O
a O
Jewish- O
aktion B-TER
. O

We O
fled B-TER
from O
the O
city O
with O
a O
group O
of O
people B-TER
, O
but O
we O
were O
noticed O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
they O
immediately O
opened O
fire O
on O
us O
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

Straight O
away O
there O
were O
32 O
victims B-TER
from O
our O
group O
. O

Among O
them O
was O
my O
mother B-TER
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
was O
hit O
by O
a O
bullet O
in O
her O
foot O
, O
but O
we O
were O
already O
in O
the O
field O
. O

We O
hid B-TER
among O
the O
crops O
until O
nightfall O
. O

At O
night O
, O
with O
great O
effort O
, O
we O
returned O
to O
Tovste B-LOC
. O

The O
first O
medical B-TER
help I-TER
that O
my O
daughter B-TER
received O
was O
from O
Doctor B-TER
Greenberg B-PER
. O

And O
only O
thanks O
to O
the O
doctor B-TER
’s O
extraordinary O
efforts O
was O
it O
possible O
to O
save O
the O
foot O
– O
she O
only O
lost O
her O
toes O
. O

Later O
, O
when O
the O
situation O
in O
Tovste B-LOC
was O
again O
in O
a O
state O
of O
tension O
– O
we O
once O
more O
left O
for O
Lysivtsi B-LOC
. O

In O
Lysivtsi B-LOC
there O
was O
still O
a O
camp B-TER
of O
200 O
Jews O
, O
who O
worked B-TER
at O
agricultural O
labor O
– O
the O
men B-TER
in O
the O
stables O
and O
the O
women B-TER
in O
the O
fields O
. O

We O
received O
food B-TER
once I-TER
per I-TER
day I-TER
. O

The O
Ukrainian B-ORG
police I-ORG
would O
very O
often O
fall O
upon O
our O
camp B-TER
and O
murder B-TER
whoever O
fell O
into O
their O
hands O
. O

Likewise O
due O
to O
the O
hunger B-TER
and O
terrible O
living B-TER
conditions I-TER
a O
typhus B-TER
epidemic B-TER
broke O
out O
– O
here O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
did O
not O
take O
care O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
Word O
missing O
. O

and O
anyone O
who O
became O
ill B-TER
was O
immediately O
murdered B-TER
. O

No O
one O
reacted O
to O
all O
of O
this O
, O
because O
the O
law O
was O
to O
beat O
the O
Jews O
. O

March O
1 O
, O
1944 O
, O
when O
the O
Soviet B-ORG
Armies I-ORG
advanced O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
Ukrainians B-TER
together O
with O
the O
Vlasovites B-PER
became O
completely O
wild O
and O
dealt O
out O
murder B-TER
right O
and O
left O
. O

They O
caught O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
from O
Vienna B-LOC
– O
Mali O

with O
her O
son B-TER
and O
shot B-TER

them O

A O
woman B-TER
– O
Shechter O

from O
the O
shtetl O

Igolnitz O
– O
they O
cut B-TER
off I-TER
her O
ears O

nose O
and O
afterwards O
murdered B-TER
her O
. O

A O
young O
man B-TER
from O
Tovste B-LOC
– O
Isaiah B-PER
Rozenstok I-PER
– O
they B-TER
cut B-TER
off I-TER
his I-TER
head I-TER
; O
another O
young O
man B-TER
from O
Tovste B-LOC
– O
Voltshe B-PER
Malier I-PER

they O
tied B-TER
him I-TER
to O
a O
horse B-TER
and O
murdered B-TER
him O
together O
with O
the O
horse B-TER
, O
they O
stabbed O
another O
middle O
aged O
Jew O
from O
Tovste B-LOC
with O
a O
bayonet B-TER
. O

A O
Hungarian B-TER
Jewish O
doctor B-TER
managed O
to O
save O
the O
last O
of O
these O
. O

The O
few O
Jews O
who O
remained O
alive O
– O
around O
two O
hundred O
– O
they O
again O
gathered O
them O
in O
Tovste B-LOC
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

For O
eight O
days O
we O
were O
watched O
over O
by O
a O
group O
of O
old O
Germans B-TER
– O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
– O
because O
the O
young O
one O
had O
been O
called O
to O
the O
front O
. O

March O
23 O
, O
1944 O
, O
the O
Soviets B-ORG
liberated B-TER
our O

We O
were O
barley O
eight O

with O
the O

when O
the O
Germans B-TER
again O
renewed O
their O
attack O

the O

Dear O

On O
Saturday O
( O

I O
had O
already O
asked O
to O
send O
a O
telegram O
for O

from O

. O

But O
already O
4 O
hours O
later O
a O
telegram O
from O
my O
husband B-TER
arrived O
. O

Now O
my O
joy O
was O
even O
greater O
, O
because O
I O

of O
the O
children B-TER
. O

Praise O
God O

Thank O
God O

They O

using O

a O
new O
medicament O
to O
fight O
the O
bacteria B-TER
, O
and O
one O
hopes O
that O
it O
works O
faster O
. O

Up O
to O
now O
you O
had O
to O
have O
negative O
swabs O
6 O
times O
in O

. O

But O
nobody O
has O
made O
it O
here O
in O
the O
7 O
[ O
? O
] O
weeks O
yet O
. O

But O
so O
far O
I O
'm O
not O
missing O
anything O
. O

The O
doctors B-TER
as O
well O
as O
the O
nurse O
and O
anyway O
the O
whole O
population B-TER
of O
Sweden B-LOC
are O
really O
devoted O
. O

Now O
, O
dear O
Doctor B-PER
, O
I O
want O
to O
give O
You O
a O
short O
report O
about O
the O
recent O
time O
. O

When O
we O
received O
forms O
from O
the O
Potsdam B-LOC
Gestapo B-ORG
2 O
days O
before O
our O
evacuation O
wherein O
to O
list O
all O
our O
possessions B-TER
, O
it O
was O
especially O
emphasized O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
worry O
about O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
Thursday O
we O
, O
the O
individuals O
mentioned O
below O
, O
were O
asked O
to O
report O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
at O
8 O
o’clock O
on O
Friday O
morning O
. O

There O
everybody O
got O
2 O
officers B-TER
assigned O
to O
return O
with O
them O
to O
our O
apartments B-TER
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
there O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
we O
had O
to O
give O
up O
our O
apartments B-TER
immediately O
, O
as O
we O
would O
be O
given O
a O
new O
residence B-TER
in O
the O
East O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
pack O
the O
bare O
necessities O
, O
under O
supervision O
. O

We O
have O
never O
seen O
anything O
of O
that O
again O
. O

At O
11 O
o'clock O
we O
were O
back O
at O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
where O
they O
took O
all O
our O
money O
and O
papers B-TER
away O
from O
us O
. O

Then O
they O
locked O
us O
up O
for O
2 O
days O
. O

Sunday O
, O
January O
11 O
, O
we O
went O
in O
covered O
trucks O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
to O
be O
assigned O
to O
a O
transport B-TER
. O

Here O
we O
had O
to O
go O
through O
another O
very O
thorough O
check O
, O
even O
food B-TER
was O
taken O
away O
from O
us O
. O

Here O
we O
met O
the O
entire O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburgerstr I-LOC
. O

, O
also O
patients O
from O
hospitals B-TER
who O
were O
fetched O
out O
of O
their O
beds O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
January O
13 O
, O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Riga B-LOC
, O
1200 O
people O
in O
an O
unheated O
overcrowded O
train B-TER
. O

Food B-TER
and O
drink B-TER
were O
- O
2 O
- O
the O
first O
thing O
we O
were O
weaned O
off O
, O
so O
we O
traveled O
3 O
days O
and O
3 O
nights O
without O
a O
sip O
of O
something O
warm O
to O
drink B-TER
or O
anything O
else O
. O

At O
minus O
40 O
° O
C O
we O
arrived O
on O
Friday O
, O
January O
16 O
, O
in O
the O
afternoon O
in O
Riga B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
received O
at O
the O
station O
with O
bludgeoning O
and O
screaming O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
and O
Latvian B-LOC
SS B-ORG
. O

Our O
last O
remaining O
luggage O
, O
e.g. O
rucksacks O
or O
bags O
, O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
behind O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
able O
to O
walk O
had O
to O
walk O
4 O
hours O
to O
get O
to O
our O
new O
home O
. O

The O
sick B-TER
etc O
. O

were O
transported B-TER
in I-TER
cars I-TER
, O
but O
they O
never O
arrived O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
found O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in O
a O
terribly O
desolate O
state O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
December O
, O
about O
30 O
- O
40,000 O
Latvian B-LOC
Jews O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
there O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

Filled O
plates O
and O
pots O
were O
still O
on O
the O
tables O
, O
from O
which O
one O
could O
see O
how O
suddenly O
this O
attack O
had O
happened O
. O

Only O
3800 O
Latvian B-LOC
men B-TER
and O
200 O
women B-TER
were O
remaining O
, O
and O
they O
were O
separated O
from O
our O
ghetto B-LOC
by O
barbed O
wire O
. O

Our O
ghetto B-LOC
consisted O
of O
about O
10,000 O
Jews B-TER
. O

They O
came O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
Germany B-LOC
, O
e.g. O
Cologne B-LOC
, O
Duesseldorf B-LOC
, O
Kassel B-LOC
, O
Prague B-LOC
, O
Hanover B-LOC
, O
Leipzig B-LOC
, O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
the O
first O
transport B-TER
from O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Two O
more O
followed O
in O
the O
next O
14 O
days O
. O

These O
transports B-TER
were O
even O
worse O
, O
because O
there O
were O
only O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
especially O
because O
there O
were O
only O
old O
people O
. O

Some O
of O
these O
people O
already O
went O
mad B-TER
on O
the O
way O
and O
died B-TER
. O

They O
always O
kept O
some O
strong O
men B-TER
to O
clean O
up O
the O
train B-TER
. O

At O
our O
transport B-TER
Feist B-PER
junior O
, O
Gormanns B-PER
junior O
and O
Gerd B-PER
Wohl I-PER
stayed O
back O

We O
waited O

Rubert I-PER
and O
a O
Miss O
Grossmann B-PER
from O
Geltow B-LOC
stayed O
behind O
with O
the O
sick B-TER
. O

Despite O
all O
despair O
we O
had O
to O
create O
a O
home B-TER
for O
ourselves O
. O

In O
the O
first O
4 O
½ O
months O
I O
lived O
together O

Apriaskys B-PER

thus O
the O

We O
were O
assigned O

On O

in O

we O
never O

Of O
4000 O
people O
2500 O
remained O
. O

Only O
the O
groups O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
Vienna B-LOC
were O
affected O
by O
this O
action O
. O

At O
the O
end O

Mrs. O

frequently O
. O

About O
mid- O
March O
Mr. O
Samter B-PER
died O
of O
starvation B-TER
and O
frostbite B-TER
. O

On O
March O
27 O
, O
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
permanent O
work B-TER
detachment I-TER
with O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
they O
called O
it O
Armeebe O
kleidung B-TER

( O
army O
clothing B-TER

) O
701 O
( O
abbreviated O

. O

Even O
though O
hunger B-TER
and O
cold O
reigned O
and O
heavy O
work B-TER
had O
to O
be O
done O
, O
I O
endured O
. O

Thus O
I O
was O
lucky O
all O
these O
years O
. O

After O
two O
weeks O
I O
already O
got O
the O
position O
of O
a O
foreman O
. O

I O
kept O
this O
position O
until O
the O
dissolution O
on O
September O
27 O
, O
1944 O
. O

About O
August O
1942 O
, O
Mr. O
Gormanns B-PER
died B-TER
, O
and O
Rose B-PER
Cohn I-PER
in O
September O
1942 O
. O

I O
forgot O
to O
report O
that O
the O
Dornbuschs B-PER
took B-TER
their I-TER
own I-TER
life I-TER
8 O
days O
after O
our O
arrival O
. O

Gradually O
we O
settled O
down O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
preserve O
our O
lives O
, O
everything O
we O
found O
in O
the O
apartments B-TER
was O
bartered O
for O
food B-TER
. O

This O
was O
punishable O
by O
death B-TER
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
matter O
already O
in O
which O
way O
one O
had O
to O
die B-TER
. O

Many O
had O
to O
pay O
by O
being O
shot B-TER
or O
hanged B-TER
. O

As O
a O
deterrent O
we O
were O
led O
past O
the O
gallows O
in O
the O
evening O
when O
we O
returned O
from O
work O
, O
but O
we O
continued O
to O
barter O
. O

In O
summer O
1943 O
the O
order O
came O
, O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
must O
be O
dissolved O
. O

All O
Jews B-TER
had O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
the O
K.Z. B-LOC
. O

A O
giant O
K.Z. B-LOC
was O
constructed O
in O
Riga B-LOC
called O
Kaiserwald O
. O

Here O
not O
only O
the O
SS B-ORG
was O
in O
command O
but O
also O
the O
most O
dangerous O
professional O
criminals O
had O
life O
and O
death B-TER
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
at O
their O
disposal O
. O

But O
there O
was O
, O
thank O
God O
, O
still O
some O
small O
- O
scale O
barracking B-TER
in O
the O
city O
and O
the O
surrounding O
area O

Our O
A.B.A. O
quartered O
us O

on O

On O
this O
day O

and O
vice O

About O

transport B-TER
. O

So O
I O
was O
the O
only O
one O
from O
Potsdam B-TER
left O
behind O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
just O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
our O
unit O
A.B.A. O
moved O
its O
headquarters O
to O
Libau B-LOC
. O

We O
traveled O
there O
by O
boat B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
day O
and O
night O
, O
but O
then O
it O
got O
troubled O
here O
, O
too O
. O

The O
Russians B-ORG
came O
closer O
and O
closer O
. O

There O
were O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
several O
times O
a O
day O
. O

Twice O
it O
missed O
me O
by O
a O
hair O
. O

I O
was O
standing O
approximately O
1 O
meter O
away O
from O
the O
impact O
. O

On O
October O
22nd O
, O
during O
the O
first O
disaster O
, O
one O
of O
our O
women B-TER
lost B-TER
her I-TER
life I-TER
. O

In O
this O
explosion O
I O
lost O
my O
hearing O
for O
14 O
days O
. O

It O
’s O
not O
quite O
all O
right O
yet O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
there O
's O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
about O
it O
here O
, O
because O
they O
fear O
that O
the O
bacteria B-TER
will O
take O
hold O
in O
my O
ear O
. O

Exactly O
2 O
months O
later O
there O
was O
the O
second O
impact B-TER
and O
we O
had O
to O
mourn O
13 O
dead B-TER
, O
and O
4 O
people O
were O
buried O
alive O
. O

Chance O
had O
it O
that O
I O
was O
n’t O
standing O
next O
to O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
so O
I O
stayed O
alive O
and O
she O
was O
dead B-TER
. O

Thus O
I O
should O
live O
. O

From O
Libau B-LOC
we O
were O
all O
to O
go O
to O
Stutthof B-LOC
/ O
Gdansk B-LOC
. O

But O
there O
was O
no O
boat B-TER
available O
for O
us O
, O
and O
besides O
our O
SS B-ORG
master I-ORG
sergeant I-ORG
had O
been O
fatally O
wounded O
during O
the O
air B-TER
raid I-TER
in O
December O
22 O
. O

On O
February O
19 O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
our O
unit O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
Luebeck B-LOC
with O
us O
. O

On O
the O
way O
our O
commander O
got O
a O
radio O
message O
that O
we O
had O
to O
be O
dropped O
off O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

Here O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
received O
us O
- O
5 O
- O
and O
put O
us O
in O
prison B-TER
at O
Fuhlsbuettel B-LOC
jail O
. O

On O
April O
11th O
the O
decision O
came O
, O
we O
move B-TER
to O
Kiel B-LOC
to O
a O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

After O
the O
march B-TER
of O
90 O
km O
, O
15 O
of O
us O
arrived O
to O
this O
hell O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
56 O
men B-TER
had O
been O
sent O
to O
the O
K.Z. B-LOC
Bergen I-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
near O
Hanover B-LOC
. O

Without O
recovering O
, O
we O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
day O
. O

2 O
hours O
there O
, O
2 O
hours O
back O
, O
during O
the O
day O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
with O
stone O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
at O
4 O
o'clock O
, O
then O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
for O
hours O
until O
we O
went O
to O
work B-TER
at O
7 O
o'clock O
. O

Whether O
it O
was O
raining O
or O
not O
, O
it O
did O
n’t O
matter O
at O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
or O
at O
work B-TER
. O

At O
6 O
o'clock O
we O
came O
back O
. O

There O
was O
food B-TER
: O
red O
beetroot B-TER
boiled O
in O
water O
or O
yellow O
turnip B-TER
. O

In O
the O
morning O
2 O
thin O
slices O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Hardly O
time O
for O
eating O
, O
and O
then O
muster O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

It O
never O
added O
up O
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
for O
hours O
. O

There O
was O
no O
water O
, O
so O
we O
could O
not O
wash O
. O

If O
someone O
tried O
to O
get O
himself O
some O
water O
, O
there O
were O
blows O
with O
the O
truncheon O
. O

Straw O
bags O
did O
n’t O
exist O
either O
, O
we O
had O
to O
sleep O
on O
raw O
planks O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
have O
underwear B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
to O
change O
, O
so O
we O
saved O
time O
on O
dressing O
. O

We O
women B-TER
had O
a O
blanket O
, O
the O
men B-TER
had O
none O
. O

About O
40 O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
every O
day O
in O
this O
hell O
after O
they O
had O
been O
tortured B-TER
. O

But O
thank O
God O
our O
stay O
there O
did O
not O
last O
long O
, O
because O
on O
May O
1st O
our O
salvation O
came O
. O

A O
woman B-TER
of O
69 O
years O
, O
who O
had O
all O
exertions O
behind O
her O
, O
even O
the O
march O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
Kiel B-LOC
, O
was O
shot B-TER
5 O
days O
before O
our O
liberation B-TER
. O

I O
forgot O
to O
report O
at O
the O
beginning O
that O
about O
2000 O
men B-TER
were O
sent O
to O
an O
extermination B-LOC
camp I-LOC
near O
Riga B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
camp O
, O
it O
was O
called O
Salaspils B-LOC
, O
approximately O
1000 B-TER
people I-TER
were O
killed B-TER
. O

Causes O
of O
death B-TER
were O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
, O
vermin O
, O
no O
washing O
facilities O
and O
hunger B-TER
of O
the O
greatest O
extent O
. O

Being O
hanged B-TER
or O
shot B-TER
was O
part O
of O
the O
main O
program O
. O

This O
camp B-LOC
existed O
for O
8 O
months O
. O

Those O
who O
returned O
from O
there O
were O
half O
dead B-TER
. O

Enough O
of O
that O
. O

--- O
Now O
, O
dear O
Doctor B-PER
, O
to O
Potsdam B-LOC
. O

Unfortunately O
I O
ca O
n’t O
give O
you O
any O
other O
information O
than O
that O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
people O
left O
behind O
. O

Until O
January O
9 O
, O
1942 O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
Sanitaetsrat O
( O
medical O
consultant O
) O
Naumann B-PER
still O
lived O
in O
her O
apartment O
. O

The O
wife O
of O
Justizrat O
( O
judicial O
council O
) O
Josephsohn B-PER
, O
Frau O
Wilk B-PER
etc O
. O

, O
they O
all O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
ordered O
to O
leave O
their O
apartment O
. O

The O
only O
one O
was O
Mr. O
Bernhard B-PER
, O
Neue B-LOC
Koenigstrasse I-LOC
, O
who O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
retirement B-TER
home I-TER
Babelsberg B-LOC
. O

The O
retirement B-TER
home I-TER
had O
been O
visited O
some O
times O
by O
interested O
parties O
, O
but O
nothing O
had O
happened O
up O
to O
the O
day O
. O

We O
still O
lived O
quite O
undisturbed O
in O
Potsdam B-LOC
- O
6 O
– O
despite O
our O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
badge I-TER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
that O
it O
lasted O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

It O
was O
reported O
by O
people O
from O
later O
transports B-TER
that O
old O
people O
were O
brought O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Now O
the O
big O
question O
is O
: O
did O
they O
endure O
this O
? O
In O
December O
1942 O
some O
young B-TER
people I-TER
from O
Berlin B-LOC
who O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
Riga B-LOC
area O
were O
sent O
to O
our O
ghetto B-LOC
for O
delousing O
. O

They O
had O
been O
evacuated O
in O
September O
. O

Of O
course O
I O
was O
interested O
in O
getting O
some O
information O
. O

But O
I O
only O
got O
the O
information O
that O
there O
was O
no O
retirement B-TER
home I-TER
anymore O
. O

So O
I O
must O
assume O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
which O
I O
unfortunately O
had O
in O
front O
of O
my O
eyes O
every O
day O
, O
happened O
there O
. O

Please O
forgive O
me O
if O
I O
do O
n’t O
moderate O
my O
remarks O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
all O
of O
us O
have O
become O
dulled O
by O
the O
experiences O
of O
the O
last O
years O
, O
one O
might O
say O
heartless O
. O

Mr. O
James B-PER
Gersmann I-PER
was O
the O
one O
who O
had O
the O
best O
of O
it O
. O

In O
January O
1942 O
, O
the O
latter O
became O
seriously O
ill B-TER
and O
was O
sent O
to O
St. B-LOC
Joseph I-LOC
Hospital I-LOC
. O

On O
January O
11 O
, O
when O
we O
were O
still O
in O
Levetzowstrasse B-LOC
, O
Mr. O
Gersmann B-PER
died B-TER
. O

Thus O
, O
with O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
Potsdam B-LOC
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
, O
also O
the O
founder O
of O
it O
all O
deceased O
. O

For O
Mrs. O
Simonsohn B-PER
it O
must O
have O
been O
terrible O
to O
lose O
all O
her O
brothers B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
. O

Well O
, O
dear O
Doctor B-PER
, O
please O
give O
my O
warmest O
greetings O
to O
Your O
wife B-TER

be O

, O
head O
of O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department I-TER
until O
1940 O
, O
most O
recently O
also O
of O
social B-TER
welfare I-TER
for O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
Vienna I-ORG
, O
told O
me O
today O
: O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
’s O
true O
about O
the O
many O
unfavorable O
stories O
about O
Murmelstein B-PER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

I O
know O
him O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
some O
characteristic O
things O
about O
him O
that O
I O
have O
experienced O
. O

He O
was O
petty O
, O
pedantic O
and O
in O
no O
way O
ready O
to O
help O
his O
fellow O
men O
. O

From O
the O
time O
of O
the O
occupation B-TER
, O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
, O
he O
worked O
for O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

His O
task O
was O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
issue O
passes B-TER
, O
i.e. O
to O
certify O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
employees O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
who O
were O
on O
afternoon O
or O
evening O
duty O
were O
allowed O
to O
walk O
the O
streets O
at O
a O
time O
that O
was O
otherwise O
forbidden B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

Now O
, O
there O
was O
a O
young O
girl O
among O
the O
employees B-ORG
who O
was O
to O
emigrate B-TER
the O
next O
day O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
day O
she O
was O
still O
working O
in O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

If O
she O
got O
a O
pass B-TER
for O
the O
evening O
, O
she O
could O
say O
goodbye O
to O
her O
friends O
. O

She O
asked O
Murmelstein B-PER
for O
a O
pass B-TER
, O
but O
he O
refused O
. O

I O
then O
asked O
him O
why O
he O
had O
refused O
, O
and O
he O
replied O
that O
since O
noon O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
an O
employee B-ORG
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

Everybody O
else O
would O
, O
of O
course O
, O
have O
issued O
the O
certificate B-TER
under O
the O
circumstances O
at O
that O
time O
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
, O
I O
was O
with O
Dr. O
Löwenherz B-PER
in O
the O
evening O
; O
it O
was O
a O
private O
visit O
, O
shortly O
before O
my O
emigration B-TER
. O

I O
had O
no O
pass B-TER
; O
I O
always O
dared O
to O
go O
without O
it O
. O

Murmelstein B-PER
, O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
house O
, O
came O
to O
visit O
Löwenherz B-PER
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
I O
said O
goodbye O
because O
I O
did O
n’t O
like O
being O
with O
him O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
fearful O
, O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
a O
pass B-TER
. O

I O
said O
no O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
asked O
why O
I O
had O
not O
turned O
to O
Murmelstein B-PER
. O

I O
replied O
: O
because O
I O
do O
not O
turn O
to O
a O
man O
like O
Mr. O
Murmelstein O
( O
said O
in O
his O
presence O
! O
) O
, O
since O
he O
would O
have O
refused O
me O
, O
because O
my O
visiting O
you O
is O
not O
official O
, O
but O
private O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
said O
: O
And O
if O
something O
happens O
to O
you O
? O
I O
replied O
: O
Then O
it O
’s O
only O
you O
having O
the O
troubles O
of O
it O
, O
because O
you O
must O
then O
get O
me O
out O
again O
for O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department I-TER
. O

But O
Löwenherz B-PER
did O
n’t O
let O
up O
, O
and O
made O
Murmelstein B-PER
to O
issue O
me O
a O
pass B-TER
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
. O

the O

On O
Sunday O
, O
the O
Viennese B-ORG
Jewish I-ORG

opened O
its O
offices O
in O
the O
usual O
manner O
. O

Formally O
, O
there O
was O
no O
change O
to O
notice O
. O

There O
were O
almost O
no O
clients O
in O

announced O
that O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
outpatient I-TER
clinic I-TER
in O
Rauscherstrasse B-LOC
was O
occupied O
. O

I O
forwarded O
this O
message O
to O
the O
directorate B-ORG
and O
we O
hoped O
that O
this O
building O
, O
which O
is O
particularly O
important O
for O
our O
welfare B-ORG

, O
would O
soon O
be O
vacated O

of O
our O
children B-TER
at O
risk O

In O

next O
two O
to O
three O
days O
the O
first O
parties O
came O
to O
the O
welfare B-ORG
department I-ORG
and O
complained O
about O
hardships O
imposed O
on O
them O
by O
neighbours O
and O
people O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O

Wednesday O
, O
March O
16 O
, O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
someone O
from O
the O
authority O
came O
to O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

They O
checked O
the O
bookkeeping O
and O
accounting O
, O
requisitioned O
typewriters O
and O
calculating O
machines O
, O
and O
recorded O
the O
status O
of O
the O
cash O
desk O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
department I-ORG
was O
already O
working O
with O
the O
general B-ORG
department I-ORG
. O

The O
clients O
were O
no O
longer O
dealt O
with O
on O
file O
, O
but O
in O
the O
antechambers O
of O
the O
welfare B-ORG
centre I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
one O
room O
, O
the O
requests O
of O
clients O
asking O
for O
support O
were O
quickly O
registered O
in O
files O
, O
filled O
in O
with O
only O
the O
most O
necessary O
data O
, O
and O
each O
applicant O
received O
a O
few O
shillings O
so O
that O
he O
could O
buy O
bread B-TER
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
we O
worked O
until O
Friday O
9 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Then O
the O
house O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
individual O
offices O
were O
searched O
, O
desks O
and O
files O
examined O
, O
and O
the O
requesting O
clients O
, O
their O
number O
went O
into O
the O
hundreds O
, O
photographed O
together O
with O
the O
clerks O
. O

At O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
the O
telephone O
line O
was O
disconnected O
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
occupied O
the O
house O
telephone O
. O

A O
quiet O
rumor O
had O
reached O
us O
that O
the O
presidium B-ORG
and O
the O
head B-ORG
office I-ORG
were O
put O
under O
the O
strictest O
surveillance B-TER
and O
some O
of O
them O
had O
already O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

The O
eviction O
order O
arrived O
at O
about O
12 O
noon O
. O

And O
while O
we O
were O
leaving O
our O
workplaces O
in O
a O
daze O
, O
a O
characteristic O
scene O
occurred O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house O
: O
- O
3 O
- O
A O
man O
breathlessly O
approached O
the O
secret B-ORG
police I-ORG
officer I-ORG
on O
duty O
and O
told O
him O
: O
A O
shop O
on O
the O
next O
corner O
is O
being O
looted O
. O

This O
is O
bad O
for O
your O
good O
reputation O
and O
ca O
n’t O
be O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Führer O
. O

And O
the O
officer B-ORG
in O
charge O
went O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
stopped O
the O
looting B-TER
. O

From O
that O
day O
on O
, O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
closed O
for O
about O
five O
weeks O
. O

The O
presidents B-ORG
and O
directors B-ORG
were O
locked B-TER
up I-TER
. O

We O
leading O
officials B-ORG
met O
daily O
, O
first O
in O
a O
small O
coffee O
house O
on O
the O
Salzgries B-LOC
street O
and O
when O
this O
was O
closed O
, O
in O
a O
still O
Jewish B-TER
coffee I-TER
house I-TER
on O
the O
Quai B-LOC
. O

There O
we O
had O
breakfast B-TER
and O
accidentally O
met O
acquaintances O
. O

Operations O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
( O
institutions O
) O
continued O
. O

I O
was O
busy O
to O
provide O
the O
homes B-TER
with O
the O
most O
necessary O
material O
as O
well O
as O
with O
victuals B-TER
, O
to O
relieve O
them O
of O
the O
transactions O
with O
the O
different O
offices B-ORG
, O
and O
especially O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
those O
in O
charge O
in O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
homes I-TER
, O
who O
stood O
pedagogically O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
, O
but O
were O
not O
up O
to O
the O
traffic O
with O
the O
very O
changed O
authorities B-ORG
. O

- O
In O
these O
difficult O
times O
, O
director O
Engel B-PER
Name O
in O
the O
original O
spaced O
out O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
particularly O
prudent O
adviser O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
helped O
to O
overcome O
all O
difficulties O
that O
arose O
. O

The O
first O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
to O
be O
occupied O
was O
the O
Dr. B-TER
Kruger I-TER
Lehrmädchenheim I-TER
Home O
for O
apprentice O
girls O
. O

But O
we O
soon O
managed O
to O
bring O
some O
of O
the O
girls B-TER
back O
to O
the O
home B-TER
. O

Special O
difficulties O
arose O
in O
the O
home B-TER
for I-TER
abandoned I-TER
girls I-TER
in O
the O
XIII B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
Auhofstrasse B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
succeeded O
in O
keeping O
this O
home B-TER
for O
several O
months O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
strictly O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
, O
there O
was O
also O
an O
interconfessional O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
in O
the O
XIX B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
a O
Wertheimstein´sche O
foundation O
for O
children B-TER
of O
all O
denominations O
. O

According O
to O
an O
announcement O
of O
the O
municipality B-ORG
, O
this O
home B-TER
was O
declared O
a O
strictly O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
one O
day O
. O

The O
Aryan B-TER
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
placed O
elsewhere O
immediately O
. O

Twenty O
- O
four O
hours O
after O
this O
announcement O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
home B-TER
informed O
me O
that O
her O
home B-TER
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
National B-ORG
Socialist I-ORG
Women I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Party I-ORG
NS O
- O
Frauenschaft O
, O
the O
women O
’s O
wing O
of O
the O
NSDA O
and O
that O
all O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
transferred O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
immediately O
drove O
out O
to O
the O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
get O
the O
deadline O
extended O
, O
tried O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
house O
, O
since O
the O
babies B-TER
- O
4 O
- O
and O
toddlers B-TER
could O
not O
be O
accommodated O
together O
with O
schoolchildren B-TER
. O

With O
difficulty O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
24 O
- O
hour O
deferral O
. O

Some O
Jewish B-TER
villas I-TER
were O
occupied O
, O
but O
no O
owner O
would O
have O
dared O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
in O
his O
house O
, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
attract O
attention O
, O
the O
only O
solution O
was O
the O
infirmary O
of O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
. O

A O
temporary O
solution O
, O
and O
we O
prayed O
that O
no O
child B-TER
would O
fall O
ill O
in O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
. O

We O
were O
therefore O
anxious O
to O
find O
a O
suitable O
roof O
for O
our O
children B-TER
. O

When O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
reopened O
, O
we O
immediately O
tried O
to O
get O
a O
foundation O
house O
free O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

The O
house O
belonging O
to O
the O
Theresianerkreuz O
- O
Verein O
in O
Untere O
Augartenstrasse B-LOC
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
and O
requiring O
the O
least O
investment O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
and O
been O
given O
furniture O
by O
emigrating O
kindergarten O
teachers O
. O

The O
rooms O
in O
Augartenstrasse B-LOC
were O
disinfected O
, O
freshly O
painted O
and O
the O
children B-TER
should O
have O
moved O
in O
within O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Then O
the O
caretaker O
called O
and O
said O
that O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
- O
after O
four O
months O
we O
got O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
year O
- O
long O
wish O
, O
a O
Jewish B-TER
infant I-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
, O
had O
thus O
come O
true O
. O

We O
adapted O
the O
house O
in O
the O
simplest O
and O
cheapest O
way O
and O
created O
a O
healthy O
environment O
for O
our O
little B-TER
ones I-TER
. O

Since O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
congregations O
’ O
offices O
, O
there O
had O
been O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
the O
welfare O
sector O
. O

People O
's O
earning O
potential O
declined O
, O
but O
housing O
and O
food O
had O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
meet O
all O
these O
demands O
. O

In O
the O
field O
of O
youth O
welfare O
, O
a O
register O
was O
drawn O
up O
for O
all O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
parents B-TER
wanted O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

The O
registration O
form O
we O
worked O
out O
has O
been O
retained O
with O
very O
minor O
changes O
for O
the O
individual O
countries O
. O

Approximately O
10,000 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
. O

Spring O
and O
summer O
had O
come O
, O
but O
no O
possibility O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
our O
weakest O
children B-TER
. O

Gardens O
and O
parks O
were O
forbidden O
. O

The O
first O
country O
was O
Switzerland B-LOC
with O
the O
option O
to O
take O
100 O
children B-TER
for O
the O
summer O
, O
and O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
Norway B-LOC
with O
15 O
. O

The O
children B-TER
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
splendidly O
recovered O
, O
- O
5 O
- O
returned O
home O
in O
the O
fourth O
week O
, O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
children B-TER
stayed O
in O
Norway B-LOC
unless O
their O
parents B-TER
demanded O
their O
return O
. O

I O
also O
succeeded O
in O
finding O
sponsorships O
for O
our O
children B-TER
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
. O

In O
these O
cases O
Madame O
de O
Monier O
was O
especially O
helpful O
. O

- O
We O
tried O
to O
bring O
children B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
, O
but O
despite O
many O
offers O
of O
especially O
nice O
and O
gifted O
children B-TER
, O
we O
only O
succeeded O
here O
in O
very O
few O
cases O
. O

England B-LOC
and O
the O
other O
countries O
decided O
to O
start O
a O
generous O
children O
’s O
action O
only O
after O
November O
10 O
, O
1938 O
. O

This O
will O
be O
discussed O
elsewhere O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Jewish B-TER
life I-TER
and O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
individual O
institutions B-TER
proceeded O
more O
or O
less O
excitingly O
. O

In O
the O
Kol O
- O
Nidre O
- O
Night O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
XVIII B-LOC
. I-LOC

and I-LOC
XIX I-LOC
. I-LOC

district I-LOC
had O
been O
given O
the O
order O
to O
vacate O
the O
apartments B-TER
respectively O
the O
houses B-TER
, O
and O
also O
our O
girl B-TER
orphanage I-TER
should O
be O
empty O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
last O
order O
, O
however O
, O
seemed O
inexecutable O
for O
that O
reason O
alone O
that O
we O
had O
since O
scarlet O
fever O
in O
the O
home B-TER
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
the O
efforts O
of O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Eichmann B-PER
to O
take O
countermeasures O
. O

In O
October O
, O
youths B-TER
from O
the O
apprentice B-TER
home I-TER
and O
the O
apprentice B-TER
girl I-TER
home I-TER
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
as O
part O
of O
a O
stateless B-TER
persons I-TER
action B-TER
. O

The O
congregation B-ORG
succeeded O
in O
bringing O
the O
youths B-TER
back O
to O
their O
homes B-TER
very O
soon O
. O

The O
house O
of O
the O
kindergarten B-TER
Wohlfahrt O
had O
been O
made O
available O
to O
the O
Youth B-ORG
Aliyah I-ORG
for O
their O
young B-TER
people I-TER
. O

About O
180 O
young B-TER
people I-TER
had O
their O
courses O
and O
meals O
in O
this O
house O
and O
were O
prepared O
there O
for O
the O
Aliyah B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
time O
a O
particularly O
intensive O
work O
began O
together O
with O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
a O
work O
which O
was O
animated O
by O
mutual O
trust O
and O
love O
for O
the O
youth B-TER
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
the O
House B-TER
of I-TER
Welfare I-TER
was O
requisitioned B-TER
by O
the O
Air O
- O
Raid O
Precaution O
. O

Smaller O
and O
bigger O
troubles O
were O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
, O
but O
we O
hoped O
to O
liquidate O
it O
in O
a O
quiet O
manner O
. O

So O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
1938 O
had O
come O
under O
many O
worries O
and O
that O
meant O
for O
the O
youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
the O
end O
of O
our O
day B-TER
care I-TER
center I-TER
in O
the O
Aspernbrückengasse B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
located O
opposite O
of O
the O
party O
house O
. O

- O
6 O
– O
Only O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
we O
were O
able O
to O
reopen O
it O
in O
the O
Mendel´sches B-TER
Stiftungshaus I-TER
in O
Denesgasse B-LOC
. O

They O
were O
able O
to O
remain O
there O
until O
November O
1939 O
, O
then O
they O
moved O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
in O
Mohapelgasse B-LOC
. O

After O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
the O
foreign O
countries O
, O
especially O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
, O
where O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
stayed O
at O
that O
time O
and O
pointed O
out O
the O
great O
misery O
of O
our O
children O
, O
decided O
to O
intervene O
with O
generous O
active O
help O
. O

We O
received O
the O
order O
to O
complete O
the O
first O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
train I-ORG
. O

An O
organizational O
task O
that O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
days O
and O
nights O
without O
interruption O
and O
that O
had O
to O
work O
out O
in O
every O
detail O
. O

From O
the O
mass O
of O
registrations O
I O
suggested O
the O
children B-TER
whose O
departure B-TER
was O
most O
important O
for O
health O
, O
psychological O
and O
material O
reasons O
. O

We O
tested O
children B-TER
, O
they O
were O
examined O
by O
a O
physician B-TER
, O
passports B-TER
were O
obtained O
, O
luggage O
was O
prescribed O
and O
checked O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
meticulous O
work O
, O
which O
was O
indescribable O
, O
but O
necessary O
, O
so O
that O
on O
December O
10 O
, O
1938 O
about O
700 O
children B-TER
, O
including O
a O
third O
of O
racial B-TER
Jews I-TER
non O
- O
Aryan O
Christian O
, O
who O
had O
been O
selected O
by O
the O
Society B-TER
of I-TER
Friends I-TER
, O
could O
leave B-TER
. O

Many O
of O
these O
children B-TER
had O
lived O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
centers I-TER
near O
the O
synagogues B-TER
and O
the O
image O
of O
destruction B-TER
stood O
before O
their O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Many O
children B-TER
could O
say O
goodbye O
only O
to O
their O
mothers B-TER
because O
the O
fathers B-TER
were O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
sight O
to O
see O
these O
seven O
hundred O
mothers B-TER
bid O
farewell O
to O
their O
children B-TER
at O
the O
terminus O
of O
the O
light O
rail O
in O
Hütteldorf B-LOC
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter O
the O
station O
building O
. O

The O
mood O
among O
the O
children B-TER
was O
one O
of O
joy O
and O
hope O
. O

They O
traveled B-TER
towards O
their O
happiness O
, O
believing O
that O
they O
could O
do O
something O
for O
their O
parents B-TER
from O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

In O
very O
isolated O
cases O
they O
succeeded O
. O

But O
these O
parents B-TER
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
flee B-TER
carefree O
across O
one O
of O
the O
nearest O
borders O
. O

We O
were O
supposed O
to O
put O
together O
another O
transport B-ORG
with O
1000 O
children B-TER
. O

However O
, O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

But O
we O
sent O
away O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
children B-TER
every O
month O
with O
English B-LOC
transports B-ORG
, O
which O
had O
been O
requested O
by O
friends O
and O
relatives B-TER
from O
England B-LOC
. O

In O
cases O
involving O
children B-TER
of O
- O
7 O
- O
stateless B-TER
and O
expellees O

the O
committees B-TER

and O
Holland B-LOC
have O
been O
particularly O
kind O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Dutch B-LOC
committee B-TER
was O
extremely O
helpful O
, O
they O
took O
over O
our O
transports B-ORG
at O
the O
German B-LOC
border O
and O
led O
them O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Geertruida B-PER
Wijsmuller I-PER
- I-PER
Meijer I-PER
Name O
in O
the O
original O
spaced O
out O
was O
also O
very O
helpful O
in O
some O
adoption B-TER
cases O
. O

Two O
groups O
of O
51 O
children B-TER
each O
were O
sent B-ORG
to O
France B-LOC
and O
from O
there O
were O
accommodated O
under O
particularly O
favourable O
conditions O
. O

Several O
groups O
went O
to O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
Sweden B-LOC
. O

A O
table O
gives O
information O
about O
the O
children B-TER
brought O
to O
emigration B-TER
by O
us O
. O

Only O
America B-LOC
did O
not O
take O
part O
in O
the O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
action I-ORG
in O
any O
way O
. O

We O
hoped O
that O
the O
Wagner O
- O
Bill O
would O
bring O
a O
solution O
to O
our O
whole O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
question O
. O

One O
day O
two O
Americans B-LOC
from O
Philadelphia B-LOC
appeared O
and O
told O
us O
the O
fairy O
tale O
that O
they O
had O
fifty O
affidavits O
with O
them O
and O
that O
in O
a O
short O
time O
, O
in O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
they O
would O
travel B-TER
to O
America B-LOC
with O
fifty O
healthy O
and O
gifted O
Viennese B-LOC
children B-TER
. O

They O
contacted O
the O
American B-LOC
consul B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
an O
American B-LOC
physician B-TER
, O
examined O
the O
children B-TER
in O
detail O
, O
and O
so O
they O
traveled O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
confirmation O
and O
from O
there O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
to O
start O
their O
journey O
to O
America B-LOC
on O
the O
President O
Harding O
. O

Thus O
the O
summer O
of O
1939 O
had O
slowly O
approached O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
Probusgasse B-LOC
had O
long O
since O
been O
sold O
and O
was O
to O
be O
converted O
into O
a O
chocolate O
factory O
by O
the O
end O
of O
December O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

We O
still O
had O
a O
reprieve O
until O
then O
; O
until O
December O
, O
the O
children B-TER
were O
permitted O
to O
stay O
. O

There O
came O
the O
war O
, O
the O
house O
was O
occupied B-TER
by O
the O
air O
- O
raid O
, O
an O
air O
- O
raid O
unit O
first O
lived O
with O
our O
children B-TER
, O
but O
then O
the O
house O
had O
to O
be O
cleared O
within O
48 O
hours O
. O

We O
solved O
this O
unpleasant O
task O
, O
avoiding O
every O
disturbance O
, O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
children B-TER
concerned O
. O

The O
children B-TER
and O
the O
inventory O
went O
to O
the O
Merores B-TER
orphanage I-TER
and O
a O
group O
of O
15 O
older B-TER
boys I-TER
went O
to O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
. O

- O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
all O
departments O
of O
the O
Open B-ORG
Welfare I-ORG
had O
increased O
. O

The O
hardship O
forced O
almost O
all O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
to O
claim O
welfare B-TER
. O

- O
8 O
- O
And O
very O
often O
we O
had O
to O
reencounter O
people O
among O
the O
clients O
who O
themselves O
had O
helped O
with O
full O
hands O
before O
the O
upheaval O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
mention O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
help O
all O
of O
them O
, O
and O
especially O
these O
people O
, O
through O
every O
means O
at O
our O
disposal O
, O
to O
overcome O
the O
gravity O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

But O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
hours O
were O
the O
most O
difficult O
. O

Whether O
when O
we O
were O
commissioned O
by O
the O
authorities B-ORG
to O
put O
together O
Polish B-LOC
transports B-TER
and O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
unnecessary O
hardship O
, O
we O
supported O
Nazi O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
attempt O
to O
carry O
out O
Jewish O
colonization B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

- O
As O
the O
leader O
of O
such O
an O
investigation O
group O
, O
I O
had O
800 O
people O
to O
talk O
to O
or O
to O
reject O
in O
one O
afternoon O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
younger B-TER
male I-TER
population I-TER
had O
already O
emigrated B-TER
from O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Or O
was O
it O
sadder O
when O
a O
woman B-TER
came O
, O
still O
full O
of O
incomprehension O
for O
the O
tragedy O
of O
her O
fate O
, O
after O
receiving O
a O
telegram O
from O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
informing O
her O
of O
the O
death O
of O
her O
husband B-TER
or O
son B-TER
. O

The O
most O
tragic O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
was O
when O
a O
fourteen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
came O
to O
me O
to O
ask O
for O
her O
and O
her O
sister B-TER
to O
be O
accommodated O
in O
a O
home B-TER
. O

It O
does O
n’t O
have O
to O
be O
for O
long O
. O

We O
only O
want O
, O
when O
the O
urn O
of O
the O
father O
arrives O
, O
... O
and O
she O
put O
a O
telegram O
on O
my O
desk O
, O
which O
she O
had O
intercepted O
so O
that O
the O
severely O
neuropathic O
mother B-TER
would O
not O
get O
her O
hands O
on O
it O
, O
we O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
funeral O
of O
our O
father O
and O
sit O
Shiva O
, O
without O
mother O
knowing O
. O

This O
father B-TER
, O
like O
so O
many O
others O
, O
was O
a O
victim O
of O
the O
days O
of O
November B-TER
1939 I-TER
. O

In O
February O
1940 O
, O
the O
first O
fruits O
of O
an O
American B-LOC
campaign O
regarding O
the O
emigration B-ORG
of I-ORG

appeared O

After O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war O
, O
we O
had O
been O
commissioned O
to O
test O
registered O
children B-TER

the O

By O

the O

had O
received O

425 O

the O

The O

was O
not O
sufficient O
to O
provide O
care B-TER
for I-TER
the I-TER

And O
the O

a O

insufficient O
for O
the O

By O

the O
number O

A O

( O
1938 O
– O
1940 O
) O
From O
time O
immemorial O
, O
the O
Viennese B-LOC
Jews O
had O
been O
frightened O
by O
the O
12th O
of O
March O
. O

On O
this O
day O
, O
in O
1621 O
, O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
duke O
named O
Albrecht O
, O
all O
Jews B-TER
with O
their O
wives B-TER
and O
children B-TER
died B-TER
by I-TER
fire I-TER
on O
the O
Erdberg O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
that O
the O
Jews O
refused O
to O
be O
baptized B-TER
. O

The O
chronicler O
immortalized O
this O
duke O
in O
the O
saying O
: O
I O
warred O
against O
the O
Turks O
, O
I O
surrounded O
Tabor O
, O
but O
I O
had O
my O
Jews O
burned O
before O
. O

Shortly O
after O
this O
Viennese B-LOC
catastrophe B-TER
, O
the O
Duke O
received O
the O
crown O
of O
Germany B-LOC
for O
a O
short O
time O
after O
the O
death O
of O
Emperor O
Sigismund O
. O

The O
Jews O
feared O
that O
they O
would O
suffer O
the O
same O
fate O
under O
his O
rule O
in O
Germany B-LOC
as O
well O
, O
but O
fortunately O
this O
villain O
died O
after O
two O
years O
. O

It O
is O
characteristic O
that O
this O
god O
- O
fearing O
Austrian B-LOC
had O
the O
Augsburg B-LOC
City O
Council O
buy O
from O
him O
the O
right O
to O
expel O
the O
Jews O
from O
Augsburg B-LOC
for O
9,000 O
guilders O
and O
to O
confiscate B-TER
all O
their O
possessions O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
period O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
Jews O
for O
two O
reasons O
: O
because O
of O
the O
indescribable O
steadfastness O
of O
our O
fathers O
, O
who O
preferred O
to O
be O
burned O
rather O
than O
to O
deny O
their O
Judaism B-TER
, O
and O
secondly O
because O
of O
the O
event O
that O
Germany B-LOC
had O
already O
once O
been O
happy O
with O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
who O
wanted O
to O
exterminate B-TER
us O
Jews O
, O
and O
for O
another O
reason O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
guiding O
principle O
of O
all O
history O
, O
that O
antisemitism B-TER
in O
Austria B-LOC
had O
been O
planted O
for O
years O
deep O
in O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
people O
. O

So O
on O
12 O
March O
1938 O
, O
the O
vanguard O
of O
the O
German B-TER
military I-TER
came O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

On O
Sunday O
our O
congregation B-ORG
opened O
its O
offices O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
. O

From O
a O
superficial O
point O
of O
view O
there O
was O
almost O
no O
change O
to O
be O
felt O
. O

Around O
noon O
, O
the O
chairman O
of O
our O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department O
appeared O
and O
informed O
us O
that O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
outpatient I-TER
clinic I-TER
in O
Rauscherstrasse B-LOC
had O
been O
occupied O
. O

These O
buildings O
, O
which O
are O
particularly O
important O
for O
us O
in O
regard O
of O
our O
children B-TER
at I-TER
risk I-TER
to O
health O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
get O
free O
immediately O
. O

The O
individual O
clients O
came O
only O
after O
3 O
or O
4 O
days O
and O
complained O
about O
hardships O
by O
neighbours O
or O
people O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity O
. O

Wednesday O
, O
the O
16th O
, O
someone O
from O
the O
so O
- O
called O
authority B-ORG
came O
to O
the O
congregation B-ORG
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

They O
checked O
bookkeeping O
, O
accounting O
, O
requisitioned O
typewriters O
, O
adding O
- O
machines O
, O
and O
recorded O
the O
state O
of O
the O
cash O
register O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Youth B-TER
Welfare I-TER
Service I-TER
was O
already O
cooperating O
with O
the O
General B-TER
Welfare I-TER
Service I-TER
. O

The O
clients O
were O
no O
longer O
dealt O
with O
on O
file O
, O
but O
in O
the O
antechambers O
of O
the O
welfare O
centre O
, O
which O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
one O
room O
, O
the O
requests O
of O
clients O
asking O
for O
support O
were O
quickly O
registered O
in O
files B-TER
, O
filled O
in O
with O
only O
the O
most O
necessary O
data O
, O
and O
each O
- O
12 O
- O
applicant O
received O
a O
few O
shillings O
so O
that O
he O
could O
buy O
bread B-TER
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
we O
worked O
– O
undisturbed O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
speaking O
- O
until O
Friday O
9 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Then O
the O
house O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
, O
the O
individual O
offices O
were O
searched O
, O
desks O
and O
files O
were O
examined O
: O
the O
clients O
making O
requests O
- O
their O
number O
was O
in O
the O
hundreds O
- O
were O
photographed B-TER
together O
with O
us O
officials O
. O

At O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
the O
telephone O
line O
stopped O
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
took O
over O
the O
house O
telephone O
. O

The O
rumor O
had O
quietly O
reached O
us O
that O
the O
presidium B-ORG
and O
the O
office B-ORG
directorate I-ORG
were O
under O
the O
strictest O
surveillance B-TER
. O

The O
eviction O
order O
came O
at O
12 O
noon O
. O

With O
all O
the O
tragedy O
, O
strange O
scenes O
took O
place O
here O
too O
. O

Our O
cashier B-ORG
, O
who O
was O
cross O
- O
examined O
from O
morning O
until O
noon O
, O
was O
finally O
sent O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O

Not O
knowing O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
he O
turned O
around O
at O
the O
door O
and O
said O
, O
Would O
the O
gentlemen O
like O
some O
more O
information O
? O
This O
naive O
question O
cost O
him O
7 O
weeks O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

From O
that O
day O
on O
, O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
closed O
for O
about O
5 O
weeks O
. O

We O
leading O
officials B-ORG
met O
daily O
in O
a O
little O
Tschoch O
( O
café O
) O
and O
- O
when O
this O
was O
closed O
- O
in O
a O
Jewish B-TER
café I-TER
. O

We O
had O
breakfast B-TER
there O
, O
met O
by O
chance O
, O
and O
in O
this O
way O
we O
communicated O
with O
each O
other O
, O
as O
it O
was O
also O
forbidden O
to O
meet O
in O
the O
apartments O
. O

The O
operation O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
continued O
. O

We O
were O
anxious O
to O
provide O
the O
homes B-TER
with O
the O
necessities O
, O
both O
materially O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
victuals B-TER
. O

I O
relieved O
them O
of O
their O
dealings O
with O
the O
various O
authorities B-ORG
in O
order O
to O
relieve O
them O
of O
the O
inconvenience O
and O
to O
make O
things O
easier O
for O
the O
wardens O
, O
who O
were O
well O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
their O
educational O
duties O
but O
were O
unable O
to O
communicate O
properly O
with O
the O
changed O
authorities B-ORG
. O

The O
money O
to O
run O
the O
homes B-TER
we O
took O
from O
the O
only O
office O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
, O
the O
cemetery B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
since O
we O
were O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
destitute O
. O

After O
the O
house O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
was O
closed O
, O
the O
cemetery B-ORG
office I-ORG
was O
located O
in O
a O
laundry O
shop O
diagonally O
opposite O
, O
until O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
community B-ORG
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
the O
representatives O
of O
JOINT B-ORG
came O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
provided O
us O
with O
the O
necessary O
means O
. O

The O
first O
house O
occupied O
by O
the O
National O
Socialists O
was O
the O
apprentice B-TER
home I-TER
for I-TER
girls I-TER
. O

But O
we O
soon O
managed O
to O
bring O
some O
of O
the O
girls B-TER
back O
to O
the O
home O
. O

Particular O
difficulties O
arose O
in O
the O
13th O
district O
in O
a O
home B-TER
for O
abandoned O
Jewish O
girls B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
strictly O
Jewish O
homes B-TER
, O
there O
was O
an O
interdenominational O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
in O
the O
19th B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
a O
foundation O
of O
Baroness O
Wertheimstein O
for O
children B-TER
of O
all O
denominations O
. O

This O
home B-TER
was O
given O
to O
us O
one O
day O
by O
the O
magistrate B-ORG
, O
to O
which O
we O
had O
good O
relations O
- O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
change O
of O
flags O
- O
as O
a O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
. O

Aryan B-TER
- O
13 O
- O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
accommodated O
elsewhere O
immediately O
. O

24 O
hours O
after O
this O
announcement O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
house O
informed O
me O
that O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
the O
National B-ORG
Socialist I-ORG
Women I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and O
that O
all O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
immediately O
drove O
out O
to O
the O
home B-TER
and O
tried O
to O
get O
the O
deadline O
extended O
, O
as O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
accommodate O
infants B-TER
and O
toddlers B-TER
in O
one O
place O
with O
schoolchildren B-TER
. O

With O
difficulty O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
24 O
- O
hour O
postponement O
. O

The O
Jewish O
owners O
of O
villas B-TER
, O
some O
of O
which O
were O
occupied O
, O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
make O
them O
available O
to O
us O
so O
as O
not O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves O
. O

So O
the O
only O
solution O
we O
had O
was O
to O
occupy O
the O
infirmary O
of O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
, O
a O
temporary O
solution O
, O
and O
we O
prayed O
that O
no O
child B-TER
would O
fall O
ill B-TER
there O
within O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

We O
therefore O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
roof O
for O
our O
children B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

When O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
was O
reopened O
, O
we O
immediately O
tried O
to O
free O
a O
foundation O
house O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

The O
house B-TER
belonging O
to O
the O
Theresien B-TER
- I-TER
Kreuzer I-TER
- I-TER
Verein I-TER
, O
a O
foundation O
from O
1847 O
in O
Untere B-LOC
Augartenstrasse I-LOC
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
and O
the O
least O
investment O
- O
needy O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
furniture O
from O
emigrating O
kindergarten O
teachers O
, O
had O
received O
gifts O
, O
the O
rooms O
of O
the O
house O
were O
disinfected O
and O
freshly O
painted O
and O
in O
a O
few O
days O
the O
children B-TER
should O
have O
moved O
in O
. O

Then O
the O
home O
caretaker O
telephoned O
: O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
. O

After O
4 O
months O
we O
got O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
year O
- O
long O
wish O
to O
own O
a O
Jewish O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
had O
thus O
come O
true O
. O

We O
have O
adapted O
the O
home B-TER
in O
the O
simplest O
and O
cheapest O
way O
possible O
to O
create O
a O
healthy O
environment O
for O
our O
little B-TER
ones I-TER
. O

The O
negotiations O
for O
epidemic B-TER
hospitals I-TER
were O
conducted O
with O
a O
body O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
unknown O
to O
German B-LOC
Jews O
, O
namely O
the O
Stillhaltekommissär O
( O
liquidation O
commissar O
) O
. O

I O
hardly O
knew O
more O
about O
this O
institution O
than O
you O
did O
when O
one O
day O
I O
received O
a O
summons O
to O
our O
Foundation B-ORG
House I-ORG
on O
the O
Schottenring B-LOC
, O
a O
house O
in O
which O
we O
often O
had O
beautiful O
and O
cheerful O
meetings O
of O
the O
WIZO B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
same O
room O
, O
a O
man O
was O
now O
sitting O
plain O
- O
clothed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
the O
liquidation O
commissar O
. O

He O
claimed O
that O
the O
emigration B-ORG
of I-ORG
children I-ORG
proceeded O
far O
too O
slow O
for O
them O
. O

Since O
we O
had O
not O
yet O
sent O
a O
single O
child B-TER
away O
, O
I O
could O
only O
agree O
with O
this O
accusation O
, O
but O
I O
made O
it O
so O
clear O
to O
him O
that O
our O
children B-TER
were O
willing O
to O
leave O
immediately O
if O
they O
had O
an O
entry O
permit O
, O
that O
he O
never O
wanted O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
again O
. O

I O
only O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
him O
by O
telephone O
a O
few O
more O
times O
, O
and O
then O
we O
agreed O
quickly O
. O

Since O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
, O
client O
traffic O
in O
the O
welfare B-TER
sector O
continued O
in O
a O
more O
intensive O
manner O
. O

- O
14 O
- O
We O
tried O
to O
meet O
the O
demands O
of O
the O
applicants O
. O

The O
income B-TER
opportunities O
of O
the O
people O
worsened O
, O
but O
apartments B-TER
and O
food B-TER
had O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
. O

A O
register O
was O
established O
in O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
service O
for O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
parents B-TER
wanted O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

The O
registration O
form O
we O
worked O
out O
at O
the O
time O
has O
been O
retained O
for O
the O
individual O
countries O
, O
with O
very O
insignificant O
changes O
. O

Approximately O
10,000 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
. O

Spring O
came O
and O
the O
time O
when O
we O
usually O
would O
make O
arrangements O
for O
our O
children O
to O
send O
them O
to O
the O
countryside O
. O

We O
looked O
for O
opportunities O
to O
emigrate B-TER
, O
we O
looked O
for O
summer O
places O
and O
found O
100 O
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
and O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
15 O
in O
Norway B-LOC
. O

The O
Swiss B-LOC
children B-TER
came O
back O
on O
time O
. O

We O
only O
got O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
French O
- O
speaking O
part O
of O
Switzerland B-LOC
by O
founding O
sponsorships O
, O
the O
OSE B-ORG
was O
particularly O
helpful O
in O
these O
cases O
. O

From O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
children B-TER
, O
however O
, O
we O
never O
heard O
again O
, O
i.e. O
we O
often O
received O
reports O
from O
them O
, O
but O
their O
addresses O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
determined O
, O
and O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
consulate B-TER
asked O
me O
every O
14 O
days O
to O
finally O
bring O
the O
children B-TER
back O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
since O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
authorities O
could O
not O
locate O
them O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
to O
bring O
children B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
, O
which O
despite O
many O
offers O
of O
particularly O
nice O
and O
gifted O
children B-TER
was O
only O
possible O
in O
very O
few O
cases O
. O

Only O
after O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
did O
a O
more O
comprehensive O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
campaign I-ORG
take O
place O
. O

But O
this O
will O
be O
mentioned O
elsewhere O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
life I-TER
and O
the O
continuation O
of O
the O
individual O
institutions O
was O
more O
or O
less O
exciting O
. O

In O
the O
Kol O
- O
Nidre O
Night O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
18th B-LOC
and I-LOC
19th I-LOC
districts I-LOC
had O
been O
given O
the O
order O
to O
clear O
the O
apartments B-TER
and O
houses B-TER
respectively O
, O
and O
also O
our O
girls B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
should O
be O
empty O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
last O
order O
, O
however O
, O
seemed O
impracticable O
due O
to O
a O
scarlet B-TER
fever I-TER
quarantine O
that O
I O
had O
stretched O
out O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
the O
efforts O
of O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Eichmann B-PER
to O
take O
countermeasures O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
enjoy O
various O
smaller O
and O
larger O
skirmishes O
. O

The O
great O
synagogue B-TER
in O
Leopoldstadt B-LOC
had O
been O
destroyed B-TER
by O
a O
firebrand O
, O
old O
and O
noble O
Jews O
had O
to O
stand O
with O
billboards O
Do O
n’t O
buy O
from O
Jews O
in O
front O
of O
the O
shops O
. O

The O
library O
of O
the O
Rabbinical B-ORG
Seminary I-ORG
had O
already O
been O
confiscated B-TER
, O
and O
the O
same O
fate O
threatened O
the O
community B-ORG
library I-ORG
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
- O
15 O
- O
stateless B-TER
persons I-TER
action O
, O
young B-TER
people I-TER
from O
our O
apprentice B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
and O
from O
the O
apprentice B-TER
girls I-TER
’ I-TER
home I-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
; O
however O
, O
we O
succeeded O
in O
bringing O
the O
children B-TER
back O
to O
the O
homes B-TER
soon O
. O

Following O
a O
suggestion O
by O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
, O
the O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
had O
meanwhile O
been O
founded O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
elaborate O
plan O
drawn O
up O
by O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
. O

Its O
purpose O
was O
to O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
people O
who O
were O
trying O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
obtain O
a O
passport B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
first O
confirmation O
had O
lost O
its O
validity O
until O
the O
last O
had O
been O
reached O
. O

In O
the O
house O
of O
the O
kindergarten B-TER
Wohlfahrt O
, O
rooms O
were O
made O
available O
for O
the O
Youth B-ORG
Aliyah I-ORG
. O

There O
about O
100 O
young B-TER
people I-TER
had O
their O
courses O
and O
meals B-TER
and O
were O
prepared O
for O
the O
Aliyah B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
started O
a O
particularly O
intensive O
work O
together O
with O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
a O
work O
which O
was O
inspired O
by O
mutual O
trust O
and O
by O
love O
for O
the O
young B-TER
people I-TER
. O

November O
10th O
had O
come O
with O
many O
worries O
. O

And O
for O
the O
Youth B-TER
Welfare I-TER
this O
meant O
the O
end O
of O
our O
day B-TER
care I-TER
center I-TER
, O
which O
was O
located O
opposite O
the O
Brown O
House O
, O
and O
which O
could O
only O
be O
reopened O
several O
weeks O
later O
in O
another O
foundation B-TER
house I-TER
. O

After O
November O
10th O
, O
the O
foreign O
countries O
, O
especially O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
, O
where O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
were O
at O
that O
time O
, O
intervened O
with O
generous O
and O
active O
assistance O
. O

We O
were O
given O
the O
task O
to O
arrange O
the O
first O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
train I-ORG
, O
an O
organizational O
task O
that O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
for O
days O
and O
nights O
without O
interruption O
, O
and O
which O
had O
to O
work O
out O
in O
every O
detail O
. O

From O
the O
mass O
of O
registrations O
I O
suggested O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
departure B-TER
was O
most O
important O
for O
health O
, O
psychological O
and O
material O
reasons O
. O

We O
checked O
the O
children B-TER
, O
they O
were O
examined O
by O
a O
physician B-TER
, O
passports B-TER
were O
obtained O
, O
luggage O
prescribed O
and O
checked O
, O
an O
indescribable O
amount O
of O
meticulous O
work O
, O
which O
was O
necessary O
, O
however O
, O
so O
that O
on O
10 O
December O
1938 O
ca O
. O

700 O
children B-TER
could O
leave O
, O
among O
them O
1/3 O
racial B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
who O
had O
been O
selected O
by O
the O
Society B-ORG
of I-ORG
Friends I-ORG
. O

Many O
of O
these O
children B-TER
had O
lived O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
centers I-TER
, O
and O
the O
image O
of O
destruction O
stood O
before O
their O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Many O
children B-TER
could O
say O
goodbye O
only O
to O
their O
mothers B-TER
, O
as O
the O
fathers B-TER
were O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
sight O
when O
these O
700 O
mothers B-TER
said O
goodbye O
to O
their O
children B-TER
at O
the O
Hütteldorf B-LOC
terminus O
of O
the O
light O
rail O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
enter O
the O
station O
building O
. O

The O
mood O
of O
these O
children B-TER
was O
one O
of O
joy O
and O
hope O
. O

They O
traveled B-TER
towards O
their O
happiness O
with O
the O
belief O
that O
they O
could O
do O
something O
for O
their O
parents B-TER
from O
outside O
of O
the O
country O
. O

In O
a O
few O
stray O
cases O
they O
succeeded O
. O

However O
, O
the O
parents B-TER
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
flee B-TER
across O
one O
of O
the O
nearest O
borders O
without O
worrying O
. O

After O
this O
transport B-ORG
, O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
arrange O
another O
one O
with O
1000 O
children B-TER
. O

But O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

Every O
month O
, O
we O
handled O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
children B-TER
for O
English B-LOC
transports B-ORG
, O
who O
- O
16 O
– O
had O
been O
requested O
for O
England B-ORG
by O
friends O
and O
relatives B-TER
. O

In O
cases O
involving O
the O
children B-TER
of O
expellees O
and O
stateless B-TER
persons O
, O
the O
committees B-TER
in O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
were O
particularly O
kind O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Dutch B-LOC
children B-TER
’s I-TER
committee B-TER
in O
particular O
was O
extremely O
helpful O
and O
took O
over O
our O
transports O
at O
the O
German B-LOC
border O
and O
guided O
them O
as O
far O
as O
England B-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Geertruida B-PER
Wijsmuller I-PER
- I-PER
Meijer I-PER
was O
also O
very O
helpful O
in O
some O
adoption B-TER
cases O
. O

Two O
groups O
of O
51 O
children B-TER
each O
were O
sent O
to O
France B-LOC
and O
accommodated O
under O
particularly O
favourable O
conditions O
. O

Some O
groups O
went O
to O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
Sweden B-LOC
, O
only O
America B-LOC
did O
not O
participate O
in O
the O
children B-TER
's O
action O
in O
any O
way O
. O

We O
hoped O
that O
the O
Wagner O
Bill O
would O
bring O
a O
solution O
to O
our O
whole O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
question O
. O

Then O
one O
day O
two O
Americans B-LOC
from O
Philadelphia B-LOC
appeared O
and O
told O
us O
the O
fairy O
tale O
that O
they O
had O
50 O
free O
affidavits O
with O
them O
and O
that O
in O
a O
short O
time O
, O
about O
3 O
weeks O
, O
they O
planned O
to O
travel O
to O
America B-LOC
with O
50 O
healthy O
and O
gifted O
Viennese B-LOC
children B-TER
. O

They O
contacted O
the O
American B-LOC
consulate B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
an O
American B-LOC
physician B-TER
, O
examined O
the O
children B-TER
in O
detail O
- O
and O
then O
they O
travelled O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
confirmation O
and O
from O
there O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
to O
start O
their O
journey O
to O
America B-LOC
on O
the O
ship O
President O
Harding O
. O

So O
the O
summer O
of O
1939 O
had O
slowly O
approached O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
Probusgasse B-LOC
had O
long O
since O
been O
sold O
and O
was O
to O
be O
converted O
into O
a O
chocolate O
factory B-TER
at O
the O
end O
of O
December O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
war B-TER
, O
the O
house B-TER
was O
occupied O
by O
air B-TER
- I-TER
raid I-TER
protection O
, O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
first O
group O
lived O
together O
with O
our O
children B-TER
, O
then O
the O
house B-TER
had O
to O
be O
cleared O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

We O
solved O
this O
unpleasant O
task O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
affected O
children B-TER
, O
avoiding O
any O
kind O
of O
attention O
. O

Children B-TER
and O
inventory O
were O
moved O
to O
the O
Merores B-TER
Orphanage I-TER
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
all O
departments O
of O
welfare B-TER
had O
increased O
. O

The O
need O
forced O
almost O
all O
Jews O
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
to O
call O
on O
the O
services O
of O
the O
welfare B-TER
office O
, O
and O
we O
very O
often O
had O
to O
reencounter O
people O
among O
the O
clients O
who O
themselves O
had O
helped O
with O
full O
hands O
before O
the O
change O
. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
mention O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
help O
everyone O
- O
and O
especially O
these O
people O
- O
with O
all O
means O
at O
our O
disposal O
to O
overcome O
the O
hardships O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

But O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
hours O
were O
the O
most O
difficult O
. O

Whether O
when O
we O
were O
commissioned O
by O
the O
authorities B-ORG
to O
put O
together O
Polish B-LOC
transports B-TER
and O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
unnecessary O
hardship O
, O
we O
supported O
Nazi O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
attempt O
to O
carry O
out O
Jewish O
colonization B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

- O
As O
the O
leader O
of O
such O
an O
investigation O
group O
, O
I O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
800 O
people O
in O
one O
afternoon O
in O
my O
office O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
became O
apparent O
- O
17 O
- O
that O
younger B-TER
male I-TER
population I-TER
had O
already O
completely O
migrated B-TER
from O
Austria B-LOC

On O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
and O
the O
Palestine B-ORG

4 O

, O
who O
inspected O
the O
area O
where O
this O
Jewish B-TER
colonization I-TER
was O
to O
take O
place O
. O

They O
came O
back O
quite O
empty O
- O
handed O
because O
the O
military B-TER
authorities I-TER
had O
enough O
to O
do O
with O
the O
population O
of O
the O
country O
after O
the O
lost O
Polish B-LOC
war O
and O
were O
not O
willing O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jewish B-LOC
question I-LOC
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
there O
was O
another O
Polish O
Action O
, O
and O
1,100 O
people O
were O
snatched O
, O
some O
of O
them O
from O
the O

that O
existed O
now O
in O
the O
various O
former O

and O
sent O

Buchenwald B-LOC

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1939 O
/ O
40 O
, O
35,000 O
people O
were O
fed B-TER
in O
15 O
places O

At O
that O
time O
, O
about O
40 O
- O
45,000 O
Jews B-TER
were O
still O
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC

These O
are O
the O

on O
the O
12th O
of O
March O
1940 O

the O
day O
of O
my O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
that O
America B-LOC
began O
to O
react O
to O
our O
applications O
, O
which O
numbered O
many O
hundreds O

and O
I O
almost O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
a O
farewell O

that O
we O
received O

Conditions B-TER

Life B-TER

The O

was O
obligatory O
for O
everyone O
except O
the O

of O
work O
was O
very O
popular O
among O
the O
younger O
inmates B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER

because O
there O
they O
had O

The O

Mortality B-TER
Rate O
. O

Finally O
the O
crematorium B-TER
has O
to O
be O
mentioned O
, O
which O
had O
been O
built O
after O
the O
mortality B-TER
rate I-TER
had O
become O
very O
high O
. O

Before O
1944 O
, O
at O
the O
time O
when O
the O
place O
was O
inhabited O
by O
up O
to O
68,000 O
, O
about O
130 O
people O
died B-TER
daily O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
Feb. O
1944 O
the O
death B-TER
rate O
was O
about O
30 O
a O
day O
, O
and O
decreased O
later O
to O
10 O
. O

The O
reason O
was O
obvious O
. O

The O
old O
people O
had O
died B-TER
or O
had O
been O
deported B-TER
, O
the O
remaining O
ones O
had O
accustomed O
themselves O
to O
the O
meagre O
diet O
and O
were O
thus O
able O
to O
endure O
the O
hardships B-TER
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
doubted O
that O
under O
- O
nourishment O
had O
been O
the O
chief O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
of O
the O
many O
old O
Jews O
who O
found O
their O
grave B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
time O
when O
the O
settlement O
was O
started O
the O
dead B-TER
were O
buried B-TER
; O
afterwards O
they O
were O
cremated B-TER
and O
the O
urns O
kept O
in O
a O
more O
or O
less O
honoured O
place O

Starvation B-TER
Diet O
. O

The O
diet O
was O
absolutely O
insufficient O
. O

The O

allocated B-TER
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
self I-TER
- I-TER
administration I-TER
provisions O
calculated O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
inadequate O
daily O
ration O
. O

But O
even O
so O
, O
the O
self B-TER
- I-TER
administration I-TER
had O
had O
to O
cut O
these O
meagre O
rations B-TER
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
priority O
to O
heavy O
workers O
and O
a O
special O
diet O
to O
children B-TER
. O

It O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
food B-TER
allocation I-TER
described O
below O
, O
though O
meagre O
enough O
, O
had O
been O
even O
worse O
before O
1944 O
. O

At O
that O
time O
many O
new O

died B-TER
not O
only O

from O

During O

I O

I O
even O

The O
news O

was O
made O
when O
a O
Commission B-ORG
from O

arrived O

Days O
in O

we O
had O
to O
clean O
the O

During O
the O

reports O
as O
follows O
in O
Berlinske O
Tidende O
about O
the O
visit O
of O
the O
Danish B-LOC
Commission B-ORG
: O
Some O
weeks O
before O
the O
Commission B-ORG
arrived O
we O
were O
ordered O
to O
paint O
the O
houses O
, O
and O
we O
got O
some O
Austrian B-TER
peasant O
furniture O
. O

Single O
beds O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
huts O
that O
were O
being O
shown O

The O
day O
before O
the O
Commission B-ORG
arrived O
we O
were O
summoned O
before O
the O
Commandant O
, O
who O
gave O
us O
to O
understand O
that O
should O
we O
dare O
to O
tell O
the O
Commission B-ORG
about O
the O
real O
conditions B-TER
all O
the O
Danes B-TER
would O
be O
sent O
eastwards B-TER
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
food B-TER
parcels O
from O
home O
would O
be O
taken O
away O
from O
us O
. O

And O
we O
knew O
that O
this O
would O
be O
equivalent O
to O
death B-TER
. O

All O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
the O
war O
invalids O
and O
old O
people O
were O
put O
into O
houses O
which O
would O
not O
be O
shown O
to O
the O
Commission B-ORG

For O
the O
children B-TER
a O
kindergarten O
was O
arranged O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
. O

The O
children B-TER
were O
instructed O
that O
when O
the O
Commandant O
entered O
with O
the O
Commission B-ORG
, O
they O
must O
run O
to O
meet O
him O
and O
shout O
Good O
- O

Uncle O
Rahm O
, O
are O
you O
coming O

with O
us O

as O

were O
to O
say O
When O

you O
coming O
to O
see O
us O
again O
, O
Uncle O
Rahm O
? O
The O
Commission B-ORG
was O
tricked O
. O

Everyone O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
scent O
that O
the O
painting O
was O
fresh O
, O
that O
the O
furniture O
in O
our O
huts O
had O
been O
lately O
put O
in O
and O
had O
not O
been O
used O
. O

And O
our O
eyes O
ought O
to O
have O
told O
them O
the O
rest O

but O
instead O
they O
thought O
that O
we O
were O
in O
good O
spirits O

full O
of O
hope O

The O
whole O
character O
of O
the O
town O
was O
changed O
by O
this O
embellishment O
by O
order O

Recreation O
grounds O
were O
laid O
out O
with O
large O
flower O

a O
music B-TER
tent O
where O
the O

was O
built O

a O

was O
opened O
where O
one O
could O
eat O
one O

on O
one O

ration B-TER
card O

The O
benches O
erected O
in O
the O
improvised O
parks O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
blessing O
for O
the O
inmates B-TER
who O
, O
from O
that O
time O
on O
, O
could O
sit O
down O
in O
the O
open O

In O
a O
word O
, O
a O
Potemkin O
village O
was O
put O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
foreign O
visitors O
. O

Dr. O
Epstein B-PER
had O
to O
make O
an O
exaggerated O
report O
about O
the O
favourable O
conditions B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
to O
the O
delegation O
. O

He O
was O
sure O
, O
as O
he O
told O
us O
, O
that O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
would O
realise O
the O
bluff O
the O
Nazis O
were O
putting O
up O
, O
but O
apparently O
the O
Commission B-ORG
allowed O
themselves O
to O
be O
deceived O
. O

Reproduction O
Prohibited O
. O

Dr. O
Epstein B-PER
had O
to O
mention O
the O
high O
birth O
rate O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
while O
in O
fact O
reproduction O
was O
prohibited B-TER
. O

Women B-TER
when O
entering O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
warned O
that O
they O
had O
to O
undergo O
abortion O
during O
the O
first O
four O
months O
of O
their O
pregnancy O
. O

Nevertheless O
there O
were O
about O
150 O
babies B-TER
born O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
black O
babies O
as O
we O
used O
to O
call O
them O
, O
babies B-TER
born O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
prohibition B-TER
. O

Religious B-TER
Services I-TER
. O

Services O
were O
held O
by O
Dr. B-PER
Baeck I-PER
and O
other O
Rabbis B-TER
. O

I O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
hardships B-TER
we O
had O
to O
undergo O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
and O
the O
even O
more O
severe O
conditions O
which O
we O
inmates B-TER
had O
experienced O
before O
, O
people O
had O
not O
become O
more O
deeply O
attached O
to O
religion B-TER
than O
they O
had O
generally O
been O
. O

Jewish O
Police B-TER
and O
Jewish O
Court B-TER
. O

Order O
was O
kept O
by O
the O
Community O
Guard B-TER
( O
Gemeindewache B-TER
) O
, O
formerly O
called O
Ghetto O
Wache O
, O
which O
, O
like O
every O
other O
institution B-TER
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
consisted O
of O
Jews O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
Jewish B-TER
Court I-TER
before O
which O
marriages B-TER
could O
be O
registered O
according O
to O
Jewish O
law O
. O

In O
addition O
the O
Court B-TER
acted O
in O
Penal O
cases O
e.g. O
thefts O
. O

It O
had O
to O
send O
its O
sentences O
to O
the O
SS B-ORG
for O
confirmation O
. O

Prison B-TER
sentences O
were O
executed O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
prison B-TER
. O

Only O
in O
one O
case O
did O
the O
SS B-ORG
demand O
heavier O
punishment O
than O
the O
Court B-TER
had O
pronounced O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
. O

Sent O
the O
defendant O
who O
had O
committed O
theft O
of O
provisions O
to O
the O
concentration B-LOC
camp I-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
small I-LOC
fortress I-LOC
. I-LOC

Otherwise O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

did O
not O
interfere O
with O
camp B-TER
life I-TER
, O
at O
least O
according O
to O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
ordinary O
inmate B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
see O
any O
SS B-ORG
men O
apart O
from O
the O
Commandant O
who O
occasionally O
rode O
on O
horseback O
through O
the O
ghetto B-TER
streets O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
administration I-TER
, O
however O
, O
had O
to O
work O
under O
the O
daily O
threat O
of O
their O
SS B-ORG
supervisors O
. O

Camp B-TER
Currency O
. O

The O
official O
currency O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Ghetto B-TER
Krone O
, O
a O
specially O
designed O
camp O
currency O
which O
the O
ghetto B-TER
bank O
circulated O
. O

Camp B-TER
workers O
earned O
up O
to O
100 O
Ghetto B-TER
Crowns O
a O
month O
. O

For O
this O
one O
could O
buy O
provisions O
such O
as O
mustard B-TER
, O
carraway B-TER
- I-TER
seeds I-TER
, O
a O
kind O
of O
Oxo O
, O
but O
also O
theatre B-TER
tickets O
and O
coupons O
on O
which O
the O
cafe O
sold O
lemonade B-TER
and O
coffee B-TER
. O

Old O
clothing B-TER
, O
shoes O
and O
travelling O
cases O
left O
by O
the O
deportees B-TER
or O
the O
deceased B-TER
, O
were O
also O
sold O
for O
Ghetto B-TER
Crowns O
provided O
one O
had O
the O
necessary O
points O
, O
which O
were O
issued O
. O

But O
things O
badly O
needed O
, O
such O
as O
additional O
food B-TER
or O
cigarettes O
, O
were O
not O
available O
for O
camp B-TER
money O
. O

For O
treasures O
like O
these O
one O
had O
to O
pay O
in O
Reichsmarks O
or O
Czech B-TER
Crowns O
. O

On O
the O
Black B-TER
Market I-TER
, O
which O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
starvation B-TER
diet O
and O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
tobacco O
, O
had O
developed O
of O
necessity O
as O
in O
every O
prison B-TER
camp B-TER
, O
one O
could O
buy O
a O
loaf O
for O
15 O
Marks O
or O
a O
cigarette O
for O
4.50 O
Marks O
( O
5/- O
) O
. O

These O
cigarettes O
were O
smuggled O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
by O
people O
working O
outside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
walls O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
by O
SS B-ORG
men O
themselves O
, O
who O
made O
tremendous O
profits O
from O
this O
illegal O
traffic O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
SS B-ORG
parties O
raided O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
order O
to O
find O
out O
people O
possessing O
currency O
i.e. O
Reichsmarks O
or O
Czech B-TER
Crowns O
, O
gold O
or O
jewellery O
. O

Anybody O
caught O
in O
possession O
of O
State O
currency O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration B-LOC
camp I-LOC
in I-LOC
the I-LOC
small I-LOC
fortress I-LOC
from O
which O
nearly O
every O
week O
transports B-TER
went O
to O
the O
notorious O
Auschwitz B-LOC
camp I-LOC
. O

-7- O
Relations O
between O
the O
inmates B-TER
were O
better O
than O
in O
Westerbork B-LOC
nor O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

People O
were O
not O
as O
nervous O
as O
they O
were O
in O
the O
more O
notorious O
camps B-TER
. O

In O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
everyone O
considers O
his O
neighbour O
an O
enemy O
who O
might O
jeopardise O
one O
's O
own O
chance O
of O
survival B-TER
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
your O
neighbour O
was O
not O
exactly O
your O
friend O
, O
but O
at O
least O
a O
neutral O
person O
. O

I O
have O
only O
noticed O
some O
tension O
and O
state O
of O
irritation O
arising O
in O
the O
relations O
of O
married O
couples O
owing O
to O
the O
separation O
. O

Humanity O
True O
to O
Nazi O
Pattern O
. O

Such O
was O
life O
in O
the O
show O
camp B-TER
the O
Nazis O
had O
deliberately O
organised O
to O
provide O
an O
alibi O
for O
themselves O
. O

Was O
it O
not O
an O
example O
of O
humanity O
to O
set O
up O
a O
kindergarten O
, O
to O
permit O
Jews O
to O
go O
to O
a O
cafe O
or O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
music B-TER
band O
? O
Humane O
indeed O
, O
if O
you O
call O
it O
humane O
to O
deprive O
decent O
, O
innocent O
people O
arbitrarily O
of O
their O
freedom O
, O
to O
strip O
them O
of O
everything O
but O
the O
clothes O
they O
had O
on O
, O
to O
feed O
them O
on O
a O
diet O
which O
enables O
only O
the O
strong O
to O
survive B-TER
, O
to O
isolate B-TER
ordinary O
people O
and O
some O
who O
had O
won O
world O
fame O
, O
completely O
from O
the O
outer O
world O
, O
behind O
guarded O
ghetto B-TER
walls O
, O
sealed O
off O
from O
life O
. O

All O
the O
time O
I O
could O
not O
help O
imagining O
that O
we O
were O
interred O
in O
a O
mass B-TER
grave I-TER
in O
which O
people O
were O
dancing O
. O

People O
danced O
, O
attended O
theatres B-TER
or O
concerts B-TER
in O
order O
to O
escape O
the O
constant O
nightmare O
haunting O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
of O
us O
: O
the O
threat O
of O
further O
deportation B-TER
to O
the O
East O
. O

Parents O
hoping O
to O
survive B-TER
the O
Nazi O
way O
against O
the O
Jews O
together O
with O
their O
children B-TER
were O
separated O
from O
each O
other O
. O

Old O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
who O
had O
been O
reunited O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
had O
to O
part O
again O
. O

A O
sister O
who O
was O
only O
64 O
years O
of O
age O
had O
had O
to O
go O
first O
, O
leaving O
her O
brothers O
or O
sisters O
behind O
her O
, O
who O
were O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
their O
seventies O
. O

But O
even O
very O
old O
age O
was O
no O
protection O
against O
the O
fate O
of O
being O
selected B-TER
for O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
, O
for O
the O
train B-TER
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

Thus O
was O
the O
humanity O
administered O
in O
the O
model O
camp B-TER
true O
to O
Nazi O
character O
. O

There O
was O
of O
course O
a O
difference O
between O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
the O
Eastern O
camps B-TER
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
those O
at O
least O
who O
were O
permitted O
to O
stay O
there O
, O
were O
allowed O
to O
die B-TER
slowly O
. O

In O
the O
East O
the O
death B-TER
sentence O
never O
expressly O
pronounced O
was O
carried O
out O
immediately O
on O
arrival O
. O

Transports B-TER
to O
the O
East O
. O

Work O
detachments O
had O
left O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
before O
my O
arrival O
and O
continued O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto B-TER
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

They O
did O
not O
go O
to O
the O
East O
, O
but O
were O
sent O
to O
Germany B-LOC
to O
build O
barracks O
and O
huts O
for O
the O
SS B-ORG
e.g. O
in O
Zossen B-LOC
. O

Only O
skilled O
workers O
, O
young O
men B-TER
in O
good O
health O
, O
were O
detailed O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
work B-TER
. O

They O
still O
belonged O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
ArbeitskommandoTheresienstadt O
( O
Work O
Detachment O
) O
, O
and O
were O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
when O
sick B-TER
or O
disabled B-TER
. O

But O
on O
the O
11th O
May O
1944 O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
transport B-TER
was O
ordered O
. O

The O
Hamburger O
barracks O
were O
cleared O
and O
there O
the O
people O
selected B-TER
for O
this O
transport B-TER
had O
to O
assemble O
. O

The O
Jewish O
self B-TER
- I-TER
administration I-TER
had O
the O
heart O
- O
breaking O
task O
of O
choosing O
the O
victims O
according O
to O
general O
orders O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

Some O
deportees B-TER
were O
named O
by O
special O
instructions O
from O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

On O
the O
18th O
May O
1944 O
7,000 O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
left O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
transported B-TER
in O
good O
wagons B-TER
, O
and O
under O
the O
guard O
of O
SS B-ORG
and O
Security B-ORG
Police I-ORG
. O

Goods O
wagons B-TER
and O
SS B-ORG
........ O
these O
were O
evil O
forebodings O
. O

In O
September O
1944 O
I O
met O
one O
person O
, O
who O
had O
left O
with O
that O
transport B-TER
, O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
just O
one O
........ O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
uncertainty O
, O
or O
rather O
the O
certainty O
of O
their O
future O
fate O
, O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
children B-TER
and O
sick B-TER
people O
left O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
composedly O
. O

On O
the O
20th O
September O
1944 O
a O
second O
transport B-TER
was O
announced O
, O
this O
time O
a O
work B-TER
detachment O
for O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Neither O
sick B-TER
people O
nor O
women B-TER
were O
selected B-TER
, O
only O
able O
- O
bodied O
men B-TER
of O
military O
age O
. O

It O
first O
seemed O
as O
if O
there O
were O
some O
truth O
in O
the O
alleged O
purpose O
of O
that O
transport B-TER
, O
work O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
, O
who O
had O
to O
join O
this O
party O
of O
2,500 O
men B-TER
, O
saw O
goods O
wagons B-TER
I O
did O
not O
feel O
at O
ease O
. O

On O
the O
26th O
September O
1944 O
the O
train B-TER
left O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Near O
Dresden B-LOC
the O
SS B-ORG
guards O
asked O
us O
to O
write O
a O
p O
ost B-TER
card I-TER
to O
our O
wives B-TER
. O

We O
were O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
we O
had O
arrived O
at O
our O
destination O
, O
that O
food B-TER
and O
accommodation B-TER
were O
good O
and O
work O
was O
not O
too O
heavy O
. O

We O
were O
to O
invite O
our O
wives B-TER
to O
follow O
us O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

This O
-8- O
trick O
was O
obvious O
. O

By O
this O
bait O
the O
SS B-ORG
wanted O
to O
entice O
our O
wives B-TER
to O
join O
us O
without O
arousing O
any O
suspicion O
about O
the O
destination O
of O
the O
next O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
transport B-TER
. O

Although O
they O
had O
the O
power O
to O
force O
everybody O
into O
a O
death B-TER
train B-TER
they O
employed O
diabolical O
methods O
like O
these O
to O
deceive O
people O
about O
their O
fate O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
irritation O
and O
disturbances O
in O
the O
model O
camp O
. O

Perhaps O
another O
commission B-TER
might O
arrive O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
notice O
the O
change O
in O
the O
mental O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
inmates B-TER
. O

The O
same O
method O
was O
employed O
on O
many O
occasions O
all O
over O
the O
eastern O
camps B-TER
. O

That O
accounts O
for O
the O
numerous O
messages O
relatives O
received O
describing O
favourable O
conditions O
in O
the O
east O
. O

The O
Hangman O
. O

After O
a O
journey O
of O
three O
days O
and O
two O
nights O
the O
train B-TER
arrived O
at O
a O
railway O
siding O
on O
29th O
September O
1944 O
. O

It O
was O
dark O
, O
about O
9 O
p.m. O
, O
but O
though O
we O
could O
not O
see O
the O
name O
of O
the O
station O
we O
guessed O
we O
were O
in O
the O
notorious O
Oswiecim B-LOC
( I-LOC
Auschwitz I-LOC
) I-LOC
camp I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
dragged O
out O
of O
the O
wagons B-TER
by O
prisoners B-TER
and O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
our O
luggage O
with O
us O
. O

It O
was O
looted O
afterwards O
, O
and O
even O
the O
small O
rations O
we O
had O
were O
stolen O
by O
the O
old O
camp B-TER
inmates B-TER
. O

We O
were O
formed O
into O
files O
and O
had O
to O
pass O
an O
SS B-ORG
officer O
– O
most O
probably O
an O
SS B-ORG
doctor B-TER
. O

He O
sat O
on O
a O
chair O
, O
three O
yards O
away O
from O
us O
, O
with O
legs O
outstretched O
in O
a O
half O
? O
? O
Text O
unclear O
position O
, O
almost O
motionless O
. O

The O
only O
part O
of O
his O
body O
which O
he O
moved O
was O
the O
thumb B-TER
of O
his O
right O
hand O
. O

With O
this O
he O
pointed O
either O
to O
the O
left O
or O
to O
the O
right O
as O
a O
man O
stood O
in O
front O
of O
him O
. O

He O
did O
not O
utter O
a O
single O
word O
. O

We O
had O
been O
ordered O
to O
answer O
three O
questions O
: O
What O
age O
, O
what O
occupation O
, O
in O
what O
state O
of O
health O
. O

I O
answered O
: O
27 O
– O
metal O
worker O
– O
fit O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
officer O
thumbed O
me O
to O
the O
right O
. O

After O
this O
sorting B-TER
of O
human O
beings O
1600 O
men B-TER
found O
themselves O
on O
the O
right O
, O
900 O
on O
the O
left O
. O

Not O
everybody O
had O
declared O
himself O
fit O
. O

Was O
this O
not O
after O
all O
a O
working B-TER
detachment O
? O
The O
very O
word O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
there O
were O
different O
kinds O
of O
work B-TER
to O
do O
, O
heavy O
for O
younger O
people O
, O
and O
lighter O
work O
for O
elderly O
men B-TER
. O

Thus O
some O
of O
the O
parded O
men B-TER
may O
have O
explained O
that O
they O
were O
suffering O
from O
complaints O
preventing O
them O
from O
doing O
too O
heavy O
work B-TER
. O

Others O
gave O
themselves O
away O
by O
their O
grey O
hair O
, O
though O
the O
whole O
detachment O
consisted O
of O
men B-TER
of O
military B-TER
age O
. O

This O
latter O
fact O
explains O
why O
so O
few O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
left O
. O

As O
I O
heard O
afterwards O
the O
usual O
percentage O
of O
people O
selected B-TER
for O
annihilation B-TER
was O
85/90 O
% O
. O

While O
queuing O
in O
front O
of O
our O
hangman O
we O
saw O
flames O
arising O
from O
the O
chimneys O
of O
several O
buildings O
, O
and O
were O
told O
by O
the O
old O
timers O
that O
these O
housed O
the O
central O
heating O
plants O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

During O
the O
whole O
night O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
in O
a O
stable O
. O

Then O
we O
had O
to O
strip O
and O
to O
give O
up O
everything O
, O
including O
our O
wedding O
rings O
, O
except O
our O
belts O
, O
spectacles O
and O
shoes O
. O

We O
were O
next O
led O
into O
a O
bath O
- O
house O
where O
our O
heads O
were O
shaved O
and O
we O
had O
to O
take O
a O
shower O
. O

We O
, O
i.e. O
the O
1600 O
fortunate O
ones O
. O

Extermination B-TER
. O

The O
other O
party O
, O
the O
900 O
doomed O
men B-TER
, O
had O
undergone O
the O
same O
procedure O
of O
waiting O
, O
stripping O
and O
giving O
up O
their O
belongings O
. O

They O
too O
were O
led O
into O
a O
bath O
- O
house O
, O
but O
instead O
of O
steam O
and O
water O
, O
poison O
gas B-TER
was O
infiltrated O
into O
that O
chamber B-TER
. O

All O
our O
900 O
comrades O
, O
with O
some O
of O
whom O
we O
had O
shared O
the O
times O
of O
anxiety O
and O
persecution B-TER
in O
Holland B-LOC
, O
and O
later O
the O
months O
of O
respite O
, O
hope O
and O
again O
anxiety O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
met O
their O
end O
in O
the O
death B-TER
chambers I-TER
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
30th O
Sept. O
1944 O
. O

They O
had O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
camp I-TER
doctors I-TER
told O
me O
later O
, O
not O
known O
up O
to O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
what O
was O
in O
store O
for O
them O
. O

Before O
they O
entered O
the O
gate O
of O
death B-TER
the O
fate O
of O
three O
of O
the O
doomed O
men O
changed O
at O
the O
very O
last O
moment O
. O

Some O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
passing O
that O
batch O
of O
people O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
picked O
out O
three O
men B-TER
, O
maybe O
because O
they O
seemed O
still O
fit O
for O
work B-TER
. O

One O
of O
the O
three O
thus O
saved O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
annihilation B-TER
was O
Spitz B-PER
, O
a O
civil O
engineer O
of O
about O
50 O
. O

His O
brother B-TER
, O
a O
Czech B-TER
Jew O
, O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
camp B-TER
with O
-9- O
a O
work O
detachment O
on O
the O
1st O
October O
. O

He O
had O
seen O
his O
brother B-TER
, O
the O
engineer O
, O
go O
to O
the O
left O
, O
selected B-TER
as O
one O
of O
the O
900 O
, O
and O
left O
the O
camp B-TER
under O
the O
impression O
that O
his O
brother B-TER
had O
been O
asphyxiated O
with O
the O
others O
. O

But O
Spitz B-PER
, O
the O
engineer O
, O
was O
alive O
at O
least O
at O
the O
time O
of O
my O
leaving O
Auschwitz B-LOC
in O
the O
middle O
of O
October O
. O

Among O
the O
selected B-LOC
men B-TER
were O
Engineer O

We O
stayed O

that O
the O
SS B-PER

his O
SS B-ORG
colleagues O
, O
were O
experimenting B-TER
on O

I O
was O
told O
of O
experiments B-TER
made O
with O
twins O
and O
also O
of O
vivisection O
carried O
out O
on O
human O
beings O

A O
girl B-TER
from O
the O
Auschwitz B-LOC

who O
had O
hidden O
there O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
evacuated B-TER
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
whom O
I O
met O
after O
my O
escape B-TER

told O
me O
that O
these O
human O
guinea O
- O
pigs O
were O
all O
killed B-TER
before O
the O
evacuation B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
were O
no O
longer O
working O
, O
nor O
were O
the O
crematoria B-TER
which O
had O
been O
blown B-TER
up I-TER

The O
victims B-TER
were O
therefore O
thrown O
into O
pits O

unslaked O

was O
poured O
over O
them O

Whether O
they O
had O
been O
shot O

I O
do O
not O
know O

the O
Jewish B-TER
camp I-TER
doctor I-TER
, O
Epstein B-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC

who O
has O
survived B-TER
, O
must O
be O
able O

furnish O

XX O
In O
Auschwitz B-LOC
everybody O
was O
more O
than O
keen O
on O
being O
transferred B-TER

up O

of O
the O
most O
popular O

in O
Berlin B-LOC

a O
star O

was O
banned O
from O

His O
fine O
performances O

were O
gratefully O
applauded O
by O
the O
Jewish O
public O

minds O
Ehrlich B-PER
distracted O
from O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
November B-TER
pogrom I-TER
of I-TER

been O
staged O
by O

re O

opening O

forced O
Ehrlich B-PER
to O
present O
a O
cabaret B-TER
show O

The O
world O
reacting O
with O
disgust O
to O
the O
pogrom B-TER
was O
told O
by O
the O
Nazi B-TER
Press I-TER
that O
the O
Jews O
could O
even O
enjoy O
cabaret B-TER
shows O
, O
and O
the O
reports O
in O
the O
foreign O

were O
nothing O
but O
atrocity O
stories O

This O
November O
performance O
on O

was O
to O
become O
a O
symbol O
of O
Ehrlich B-PER

future O
fate O
: O
a O

who O
had O
to O
smile O

make O
people O
laugh O
by O
the O
order O
of O
his O

In O

called O

detachment I-ORG
employed O
in O
searching O
the O

of O
the O
newcomers O

plundered O
them O

enriched O
themselves O
grossly O

A O
diamond O

found O
in O
a O

in O
which O
a O

had O
tried O
to O
save O
his O

fetched O
40,000 O

That O

enabled O
the O

buy O

for O

one O

took O
place O
when O

were O
detailed O
for O

In O
exchange O
for O
their O
name O
they O
got O
a O
number O
which O
was O
tattooed O
on O
the O

My O
number O
was O
B12749 O

The O

kept O
in O

department I-TER
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
were O
burned B-TER
when O
the O
Nazis O
retreated O
in O
Jan. O
1945 O
. O

I O
should O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
the O
deportees B-TER
who O
were O
gassed B-TER
immediately O
on O
arrival O
were B-TER
not I-TER
registered I-TER
at O
all O

They O
were O
destroyed O
like O
vermin O
, O
nameless O
victims B-TER
, O
leaving O
no O
trace O
behind O
them O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
Oct. O
1944 O
, O
after O
being O
clothed B-TER
in O
prisoner B-TER
's I-TER
garments O
and O
given O
wooden O
boots O
– O
usually O
leather O

were O
stolen O
by O

I O
was O
transferred B-TER
to O
the O

Gleiwitz B-LOC

It O
belonged O
to O
the O
Concentration B-LOC
Camp I-LOC
Auschwitz I-LOC

We O
were O
housed O
in O
the O
yard O
of O

There O
we O
got O
our O

were O
not O
allowed O

, O
converted O
into O
a O
small O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
surrounded O
by O
electrified O
barbed O

We O
, O
the O
new O
batch O
of O
150 O
men O
, O
found O
there O
450 O
old O
prisoners B-TER
. O

We O
were O
to O
assemble O
gun O
carriages O
, O
which O
should O
have O
been O
assembled O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
four O
a O
day O
, O
but O
owing O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
tools O
, O
skilled O
labour O
and O
sabotage B-TER
which O
we O
tried O
to O
do O
wherever O
we O
could O
, O
it O
took O
us O
six O
weeks O
to O
assemble O
the O
schemed O
production O
of O
two O
days O
. O

We O
worked O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
a O
Polish B-TER
Chief O
Engineer O
, O
while O
the O
camp B-TER
itself O
was O
run O
by O
the O
Lagerfuehrer O
SS B-ORG
. O

Oberschar O
F. B-PER
Spicker I-PER
. O

In O
him O
I O
found O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
numerous O
encounters O
with O
members O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

a O
man O
free O
from O
any O
sadistic O
traits O
. O

Maybe O
that O
the O
death B-TER
of O
his O
son B-TER
, O
who O
had O
been O
killed B-TER
in O
action O
shortly O
before O
our O
arrival O
, O
had O
made O
him O
realise O
the O
value O
of O
life O
. O

Anyway O
, O
none O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
in O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
III I-LOC
was O
ill O
- O
treated O
, O
and O
the O
twenty O
odd O
who O
died B-TER
there O
succumbed O
to O
under O
- O
nourishment O
or O
died B-TER
from O
accidents O
and O
lack O
of O
medical O
attention O
. O

When O
we O
were O
evacuated B-TER
on O
18 O
Jan. O
1945 O
Spicker B-PER
led O
our O
party O
for O
two O
days O
. O

We O
were O
marching O
from O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
to O
Cosel B-LOC
, O
but O
had O
to O
return O
to O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
for O
unknown O
reasons O
. O

We O
were O
guarded O
by O
newly O
formed O
SS B-ORG
detachments O
, O
conscripted O
from O
members O
of O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
. O

Not O
a O
single O
man B-TER
was O
shot B-TER
whereas O
, O
as O
I O
learned O
later O
, O
hundreds O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
in O
the O
work B-TER
detachment O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
and B-LOC
II I-LOC
were O
shot B-TER
down I-TER
and O
died B-TER
by O
the O
roadside O
like O
hunted O
animals O
. O

I O
stress O
this O
fact O
purposely O
because O
I O
want O
to O
emphasise O
that O
the O
whole O
responsibility O
for O
the O
murder B-TER
of O
my O
poor O
fellow- O
prisoners B-TER
lies O
with O
the O
Commanding O
SS B-ORG
Officers O
. O

Where O
no O
orders O
to O
massacre B-TER
were O
given O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Spicker B-PER
, O
no O
one O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

We O
were O
marched B-TER
back O
to O
Blechhammer B-LOC
on O
our O
way O
to O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
III I-LOC
. O

On O
the O
21 O
Jan. O
1945 O
I O
noticed O
that O
some O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
Guards B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
camp I-TER
had O
left O
their O
posts O
, O
when O
I O
was O
pushed O
out O
of O
the O
gates O
by O
the O
crowd O
of O
fellow- O
prisoners B-TER
. O

Together O
with O
a O
fellow B-TER
- I-TER
prisoner I-TER
, O
Dr. O
Eduard B-PER
Zelderust I-PER
, O
I O
ran O
away O
. O

For O
some O
days O
and O
nights O
we O
remained O
in O
the O
forest O
near O
Blechhammer B-LOC
where O
we O
heard O
the O
roar O
of O
the O
approaching O
battle O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
. O

There O
were O
machine O
- O
gun O
bullets O
and O
shell O
- O
fire O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
frightened O
. O

Was O
this O
only O
due O
to O
our O
lack O
of O
fighting O
experience O
? O
In O
part O
it O
might O
have O
been O
so O
because O
we O
were O
surprised O
when O
we O
noticed O
that O
all O
civilians B-TER
around O
us O
had O
suddenly O
disappeared O
. O

-11- O
It O
took O
us O
some O
time O
to O
realise O
that O
these O
people B-TER
had O
simply O
thrown O
themselves O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
in O
order O
to O
take O
cover O
, O
and O
we O
followed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
their O
example O
. O

But O
I O
think O
there O
was O
another O
reason O
for O
our O
standing O
upright O
while O
shells O
and O
bullets O
whistled O
around O
us O
. O

It O
was O
impersonal O
death B-TER
which O
we O
here O
encountered O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
bullets O
and O
shells O
were O
not O
meant O
to O
end O
just O
our O
lives O
. O

Death B-TER
, O
which O
had O
been O
at O
our O
heels O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
our O
falling O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Nazis O
, O
death O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
was O
quite O
a O
different O
companion O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-LOC
we O
were O
singled O
out O
, O
we O
Jews B-TER
, O
defenseless O
, O
completely O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
merciless O
. O

Death B-TER
was O
lurking O
at O
every O
corner O
ready O
to O
force O
us O
into O
his O
suffocating O
grip O
. O

At O
times O
we O
even O
felt O
a O
desire O
to O
surrender O
to O
this O
greedy O
companion O
to O
escape B-TER
at O
least O
the O
daily O
, O
nay O
hourly O
, O
threat O
that O
he O
might O
strike O
us O
down O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-LOC
we O
had O
to O
resist B-TER
the O
temptation O
to O
throw O
ourselves O
against O
the O
seductive O
electric O
wire O
and O
thus O
end O
our O
suspense O
. O

In O
the O
Blechhammer B-LOC
Forest O
, O
where O
only O
impersonal O
death B-TER
threatened O
, O
we O
shared O
a O
danger O
common O
to O
all O
and O
felt O
free O
and O
relieved O
even O
when O
we O
realised O
that O
the O
shells O
and O
bullets O
might O
end O
our O
escape B-TER
into O
life O
. O

The O
Jewish B-ORG
Central I-ORG

Office I-ORG
has O
been O
informed O
by O
another O
eye O
- O
witness O
that O
, O
after O
Mr. O
Mannheimer B-PER
's O
deportation B-TER
, O
transports B-TER
to O
the O
East O
continued O
to O
leave O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
about O
a O
total O
of O
18,000 O
people O
were O
removed B-TER
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
1944 O
. O

In O
the O
early O
months O
of O
1945 O
the O
Nazis O
deliberately O
brought O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
people O
from O
other O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
who O
were O
infected O
with O
typhus B-TER
; O
some O
days O
trains B-TER
arrived O
with O
up O
to O
150 O
bodies B-TER
of O
people O
who O
had O
died B-TER
from O
this O
disease B-TER
on O
the O
way O
. O

When O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
liberated B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-ORG
there O
were O
some O
5,000 O
Jews O
from O
Germany B-LOC
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
4,000 O
Jewish O
husbands B-TER
or O
wives B-TER
of O
mixed B-TER
marriages I-TER
who O
had O
been O
separated B-TER
from O
their O
non O
- O
Jewish O
partners O
. O

This O
eye O
- O
witness O
estimated O
that O
the O
death B-TER
rate I-TER
during O
the O
maximum O
occupation O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
which O
he O
maintains O
was O
not O
more O
than O
40,000 O
, O
was O
150 O
a O
day O
. O

He O
is O
of O
opinion O
that O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
never O
intended O
to O
be O
anything O
more O
than O
a O
transit B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
irrespective O
of O
the O
age O
of O
the O
people O
privileged O

live O
in O

The O
testimony B-TER
of O
Ernestine B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
is O
of O
particular O
relevance O
, O
because O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
reports B-TER
about O
a O
camp O
beyond O
the O
river O
Bug O
, O
and O
apart O
from O
that O
because O
it O
confirms O
and O
complements O
another O
report B-TER
. O

So O
far O
it O
was O
only O
known O
from O
the O
first O
letter B-TER
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
from O
November O
10 O
, O
1955 O
that O
there O
is O
a O
book B-TER
by O
Arnold B-PER
Daghani I-PER
( O
Korn O
) O
, O
which O
deals O
with O
the O
camp B-LOC
Tarasivka I-LOC
and O
also O
contains O
sections O
about O
the O
son B-PER
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
. O

We O
had O
tried O
in O
vain O
so O
far O
to O
obtain O
it O
for O
the O
library B-TER
, O
because O
Dr. B-PER
Weinstein I-PER
, O
who O
is O
mentioned O
in O
the O
letter B-TER
as O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
Romanian B-LOC
copy O
, O
once O
lent O
it O
to O
someone O
and O
does O
not O
remember O
to O
whom O
and O
did O
not O
get O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
library B-TER
has O
so O
far O
also O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
obtain O
an O
English B-LOC
copy O
through O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
World I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
said O
to O
have O
helped O
to O
publish O
an O
English B-LOC
edition O
at O
that O
time O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

– O
As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
then O
put O
a O
search O
note O
in O
the O
newspaper B-TER
of O
the O
Bukovina B-LOC
Jews O
in O
Israel B-LOC
Die O
Stimme O
, O
and O
subsequently O
Dr. B-PER
Fischer I-PER
, O
who O
works O
at O
the O
URO B-ORG
in O
Tel B-LOC
Aviv I-LOC
, O
lent O
a O
Romanian B-LOC
copy O
to O
the O
library B-TER
. O

However O
, O
- O
2 O
- O
I O
myself O
have O
not O
yet O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
take O
note O
of O
the O
content O
, O
as O
it O
has O
been O
lent O
for O
scientific O
work O
. O

– O
Furthermore O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
my O
trip O
to O
Europe B-LOC
I O
became O
aware O
of O
another O
report B-TER
on O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
located O
at O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
and O
whose O
author O
is O
a O
Mr. O
Segall B-PER
probably O
Nathan O
Segall O
, O
murdered O
in O
Tarasivka O
1943 O
, O
who O
wrote O
this O
report B-TER
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
. O

An O
accompanying O
report B-TER
by O
another O
author O
, O
who O
is O
not O
mentioned O
, O
shows O
that O
Segall B-PER
wrote O
this O
report B-TER
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
, O
whereto O
he O
traveled O
from O
Tarasivka B-LOC
in O
the O
company O
of O
an O
SS B-ORG
man O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man O
then O
continued O
to O
Bukovina B-LOC
and O
Romania B-LOC
to O
seek O
help B-TER
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
and O
later O
Segall B-PER
returned O
there O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
man O
, O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
accompanying O
report B-TER
, O
died O
there O
during O
the O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
on O
December O
13 O
, O
1943 O
. O

As O
I O
heard O
from O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
this O
Segall B-PER
report B-TER
to O
Yad B-ORG
Vashem I-ORG
with O
the O
next O
shipment O
of O
testimonies B-TER
is O
imminent O
. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
author O
of O
the O
accompanying O
report B-TER
is O
not O
given O
, O
and O
must O
not O
yet O
be O
given O
by O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
, O
because O
he O
himself O
intends O
to O
publish O
it O
. O

- O
It O
is O
now O
very O
interesting O
that O
this O
SS B-ORG
Lieutenant O
Elsässer B-PER
, O
who O
visited O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
according O
to O
the O
report B-TER
of O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
and O
provided O
help B-TER
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
is O
the O
same O
who O
had O
previously O
been O
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
and O
about O
whom O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
has O
the O
mentioned O
report B-TER
, O
because O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
told O
me O
in O
the O
course O
of O
her O
testimony B-TER
that O
Elsässer B-PER
first O
went O
to O
Mogilev B-LOC
with O
a O
Jew O
named O
Segall B-PER
, O
but O
could O
not O
take O
him O
further O
, O
and O
then O
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
alone O
with O
a O
sergeant O
. O

So O
one O
report B-TER
confirms O
the O
other O
! O
There O
are O
some O
more O
details O
to O
note O
about O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
’s I-PER
statement B-TER
: O
the O
assumption O
of O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
that O
Elsässer B-PER
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Todt B-ORG
organization I-ORG
and O
the O
camp B-LOC
- O
3 O
- O
is O
not O
very O
likely O
, O
because O
in O
general O
these O
functions O
were O
separate O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
whole O
action O
of O
Elsässer B-PER
and O
his O
behavior O
is O
something O
unique O
. O

There O
is O
no O
other O
case O
known O
that O
a O
German B-LOC
SS B-ORG
man O
or O
officer O
undertook O
such O
a O
journey O
, O
which O
was O
apparently O
officially O
approved O
or O
at O
least O
permitted O
. O

According O
to O
the O
descriptions B-TER
of O
Mrs. O
R. B-PER
and O
also O
of O
Segall B-PER
he O
also O
seems O
to O
have O
really O
wanted O
to O
help B-TER
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
and O
not O
to O
make O
money O
for O
the O
SS B-ORG
or O
to O
go O
raiding B-TER
. O

It O
would O
be O
worth O
considering O
whether O
one O
should O
try O
to O
determine O
if O
he O
survived O
the O
war B-TER
and O
to O
contact O
him O
. O

In O
summary O
of O
this O
information O

for O
further O
details O
, O
I O
report B-TER
: O
My O
son B-PER
and O
his O
wife B-TER
Anni B-PER
( I-PER
Hanna I-PER
) I-PER
were O
taken O
out O
of O
their O
home O
in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
on O
June O
14 O
, O
1942 O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
Laidzin I-LOC
probably O
Ladyzhin O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
. O

From O
there O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
across O
the O
river O
Bug B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
they O
came O
through O
Bershad B-LOC
from O
there O
we O
received O
a O
postcard O
with O
a O
greeting O
. O

My O
son B-PER
was O
an O
excellent O
engineer O
, O
and O
beyond O
the O
river O
Bug B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
were O
probably O
in O
different O
camps B-TER
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
Organisation B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
( O
as O
all O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
did O
handwritten O
addition O
) O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
or O
end O
of O
October O
1943 O
, O
a O
senior O
lieutenant O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
with O
a O
sergeant O
from O
Tarasivka B-LOC
to O
collect O
donations O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
. O

He O
lodged O
with O
the O
grammar O
school O
professor O
Schwarz B-PER
, O
the O
father B-TER
of O
my O
daughter B-PER
- I-PER
in I-PER
- I-PER
law I-PER
, O
he O
brought O
a O
general O
letter B-TER
( O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
... O
crossed O
out O
in O
the O
original O
) O
from O
my O
son B-PER
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
in O
which O
he O
asked O
for O
help B-TER
for O
all O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
and O
a O
second O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
to O
us O
. O

Everything O
I O
report B-TER
in O
the O
following O
is O
based O
on O
this O
lieutenant O
’s O
statements B-TER
. O

His O
name O
was O
Elsässer B-PER
, O
in O
civilian O
life O
he O
was O
a O
contractor O
and O
came O
from O
Cologne B-LOC
. O

He O
came O
at O
the O
instigation O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
to O
fetch O
gifts O
for O
them O
. O

On O
his O
departure O
from O
- O
5 O
- O
Tarasivka B-LOC
with O
the O
sergeant O
he O
took O
two O
Jews O
with O
him O
, O
my O
son B-PER
and O
another O
one O
called O
Segall B-PER
. O

But O
my O
son B-PER
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Bug B-LOC
and O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
any O
further O
. O

The O
other O
one O
, O
Segall B-PER
, O
accompanied O
him O
to O
Mogilev B-LOC
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
also O
had O
to O
stay O
. O

The O
lieutenant O
and O
the O
sergeant O
continued O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
Elsässer B-PER
was O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
group O
of O
the O
organization B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
, O
which O
was O
building O
roads O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
-controlled O
area O
beyond O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

Since O
he O
was O
powerful O
, O
I O
assume O
that O
he O
coincidentally O
was O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
Tarasivka I-LOC
, O
too O
. O

It O
was O
not O
only O
Jews B-TER
coming O
from O
Transnistria B-LOC
working B-TER
there O
but O
also O
two O
other O
groups O
, O
i.e. O
not O
only O
Bukovina B-LOC
Jews O
, O
but O
also O
Ukrainian B-LOC
Jews O
. O

Jews O
who O
came O
from O
Ukraine B-LOC
( O
Transnistria B-LOC
) O
, O
and O
Polish B-LOC
Jews O
. O

But O
in O
total O
there O
were O
only O
300 O
people O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
enclosed O
letter B-TER
by O
my O
son B-PER
. O

Elsässer B-PER
brought O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
the O
Jews O
in O
T. B-LOC
to O
the O
congregation O
. O

in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
cry O
for O
help O
. O

He O
also O
brought O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
, O
whose O
transcript O
I O
have O
handed O
over O
. O

My O
son B-PER
’s I-PER
letter B-TER
is O
written O
in O
Romanian B-LOC
. O

Since O
we O
only O
ever O
spoke O
and O
wrote O
German B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
can O
only O
assume O
that O
my O
son B-PER
did O
not O
want O
the O
German B-LOC
officer O
to O
read O
the O
letter B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
of O
the O
community B-TER
of O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
behaved O
magnificently O
, O
although O
most O
of O
them O
were O
already O
impoverished B-TER
. O

They O
donated B-TER
food B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
shoes B-TER
in O
large O
amounts O
. O

They O
also O
gave O
Elsässer B-PER
a O
large O
shipment O
of O
champagne O
, O
ham B-TER
, O
bacon B-TER
, O
new O
shoes B-TER
and O
fur B-TER
coats I-TER
for O
the O
SS B-ORG
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
so O
that O
the O
SS B-ORG
was O
satisfied O
and O
refrained O
from O
taking O
possession O
of O
things O
intended O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
was O
a O
shipment O
of O
4 O
- O
5 O
trucks O
. O

From O
us O
personally O
, O
Elsässer B-PER
received O
valuable O
gifts O
, O
leather O
goods O
, O
jewelry O
, O
etc O
.. O
handwritten O
addition O
Elsässer B-PER
told B-TER
us O
further O
: O
My O
son B-PER
was O
his O
most O
outstanding O
worker B-TER
. O

When O
a O
difficult O
part O
of O
the O
technical O
work B-TER
was O
finished O
, O
a O
big O
party O
was O
celebrated O
. O

Elsässer B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
having O
my O
son B-PER
and O
daughter B-PER
- I-PER
in I-PER
- I-PER
law I-PER
invited O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
festival O
he B-PER
and O
his O
wife B-PER
were O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
on O
a O
sleigh O
. O

Elsässer B-PER
gave O
the O
coachman O
the O
instruction O
: O
Go O
where O
Mr. O
Rosengarten O
wants O
you O
to O
go O
. O

Apparently O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
him O
the O
opportunity O
to O
escape B-TER
back O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
via O
the O
river B-LOC
Bug I-LOC
. O

But O
my O
son B-PER
did O
not O
take O
that O
chance O
. O

Because O
for O
every O
Jew O
who O
fled B-TER
, O
10 O
others O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

Elsässer B-PER
told O
us O
this O
, O
albeit O
not O
with O
these O
very O
words O
, O
and O
added O
: O
A O
Rosengarten O
does O
not O
do O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

My O
son B-PER
’s I-PER
letter B-TER
was O
dated O
September O
14 O
, O
1943 O
, O
but O
my O
statement O
in O
the O
preface O
to O
the O
letter B-TER
, O
namely O
that O
Elsässer B-PER
came O
to O
us O
in O
September O
, O
is O
inaccurate O
, O
he O
did O
n’t O
come O
until O
mid- O
October O
or O
late O
October O
. O

After O
he O
had O
travelled O
back O
with O
all O
this O
things O
, O
a O
short O
time O
later O
, O
a O
message O
came O
from O
Tarasivka B-LOC
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
, O
in O
a O
safe O
way O
, O
that O
the O
things O
had O
been O
received O
there O
. O

We O
always O
said O
later O
that O
they O
could O
not O
even O
have O
eaten O
the O
food B-TER
because O
the O
camp B-LOC
was O
liquidated O
on O
December O
13 O
. O

( O
if O
the O
date O
, O
which O
is O
mentioned O
in O
the O
later O
mentioned O

Mr. O

correct O

My O
daughter B-PER
- I-PER
in I-PER
- I-PER
law I-PER
once O
had O
a O
severe O
typhoid B-TER
fever I-TER
. O

My O
son B-PER
gave O
her O
the O
only O
coat B-TER
he O
still O
owned O
for O
covering O
. O

Sometime O
before O
that O
, O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
had O
arrived O
, O
obviously O
in O
his O
own O
handwriting O
, O
which O
contained O
a O
sign O
of O
life O
from O
T. B-LOC
. O

The O
letter B-TER
was O
written O
on O
very O
good O
white O
stationery O
- O
7 O
- O
and O
sent O
in O
an O
equally O
good O
white O
envelope O
from O
a O
post O
office O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
and O
addressed O
to O
his O
father B-PER

with O
the O
outside O
address O
Mr. O
B. B-PER

Prof. O

.. O
This O
was O
a O
very O
unusual O
formulation O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
of O
the O
Reich O
, O
and O
the O
letter O
was O
also O
written O
in O
this O
style O
. O

Apparently O
he O
had O
given O
it O
to O
an O
officer O
who O
went O
on O
vacation O
to O
Germany B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
letter O
should O
not O
be O
noticed O
in O
an O

his O

A O

to O
add O
a O
further O
addition O
to O
the O
report B-TER

I O
said O
in O
the O
accompanying O
report B-TER
that O
no O
other O
case O
was O
known O
to O
me O
that O
an O
SS B-ORG
-man O
had O
sought O
help B-TER
for O
Jews O
. O

That O
is O
not O
correct O
. O

I O
had O
parts O
of O
Daghani B-PER
's O
book B-TER
translated O
for O
me O
orally O
by O
Mrs. O
Roll B-PER
in O
Tel B-LOC
Aviv I-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Roll B-PER
comes O
from O
Chernivtsi B-LOC

and O
she O
knew O
quite O
a O
few O
of O
the O
people O
mentioned O
in O
the O
book B-TER
personally O
. O

She O
told O
me O
that O
relatively O
often O
SS B-ORG
-men O
from O
Bukovina B-LOC
and O
Transnistria B-LOC
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
who O
brought O
news O
about O
the O
deportees B-TER
, O
and O
took O
food B-TER
for O
them O
, O
not O
infrequently O
even O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

Her O
own O
father B-TER
was O
interned B-TER
in O
Djwin O
and O
died O
there O
, O
and O
she O
had O
sent O
him O
help B-TER
through O
an O
SS B-ORG
-man O
who O
did O
not O
accept O
payment O
. O

At O

Mr. O

I O
found O
a O
remark O
referring O

the O
family B-TER
of O
the O
engineer O
Rosengarten B-PER
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O

The O
remark O
reads O
: O
Dear O
friends O
! O
... O
nevertheless O
, O
I O
feel O
compelled O
to O
warmly O
word O
missing O
, O
probably O
recommend O
to O
you O
again O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
Tulcin B-LOC
Jews O
, O
and O
I O
will O
assume O
that O
he O
has O
not O
only O
discussed O
this O
case O
with O
you O
, O
but O
that O
he O
will O
also O
bring O
something O
concrete O
with O
him O
. O

I O
myself O
wrote O
to O
you O
in O
detail O
at O
the O
time O
, O
after O
Mr O
Segall B-PER
’s I-PER
visit O
, O
and O
asked O
you O
to O
send O
an O
urgent O
order O
from O
there O
to O
the O
Tulcin B-LOC
Prefecture O
to O
demand O
the O
return O
of O
all O
Jews B-TER
who O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Bug B-LOC

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
pertaining O
request O
was O
unsuccessful O
and O
today O
there O
is O
nobody O
left O
to O
bring O
back O
. O

My O
personal O
intervention O
in O
Tulcin B-LOC
in O
this O
matter O
probably O
was O
successful O
in O
so O
far O
that O
the O
order O
was O
given O
for O
the O
families B-TER
Segall B-PER

Ing O
. O

Rosengarten B-PER
to O
bring O
them O
back O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
chain O
of O
circumstances O
they O
were O
already O
dead O
two O

before O
that O

fifty O
( O

Most O
were O
small O
traders O

Others O
worked B-TER
in O

The O
Jews O
lived O
in O
peace O
with O
the O
local O
Lithuanian B-TER

. O

All O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
shtetl O
had O
their O
own O
horses O
and O
other O
beasts O
. O

In O
the O
shtetl O
there O
was O
a O
Folks B-TER
- I-TER
School I-TER
, O
a O
library O
, O
and O
a O
large O
, O
old O
synagogue B-TER
with O
an O
ancient O
Holy O

The O
Holy O
Ark O
was O
decorated O
with O

Tourists O

Apart O

there O
was O
a O

After O

the O
Hebrew O

School I-TER
, O
Jewish O
children B-TER
studied O
in O
the O
Hebrew O
gymnasium B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC

The O
German B-ORG
army I-ORG
entered O
the O
shtetl O
on O
Thursday O
, O
June O
26 O
, O
1941 O
. O

All O
Jewish O
families B-TER
fled B-TER
from O
the O
shtetl O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
June O
24 O
. O

The O
flight B-TER
from O
the O
shtetl O
was O
not O
difficult O
, O
because O
almost O
all O
owned O
their O
own O
horses O
and O
wagons O
. O

The O
Jews O
left O
their O
beasts O
, O
mainly O
the O
cows O
, O
with O
their O
Lithuanian B-TER
neighbors I-TER
. O

Obviously O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
take O
everything O
with O
them O
and O
they O
left O
it O
behind O
. O

They O
locked O
the O
doors O
. O

Almost O
all O
Jews O
traveled O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Sviliaś B-LOC
[ O
Svilė B-LOC
] O
, O
three O
kilometers O
from O
the O
shtetl O
. O

The O
Jewish O
family B-TER
Levin B-PER
, O
three O
people B-TER
, O
lived O
in O
the O
village O
. O

Mr. O
Levin B-PER
was O
ordained O
as O
a O
Rabbi B-TER
but O
he O
did O
not O
work B-TER
as O
a O
Rabbi B-TER

Levin B-PER
had O
his O
own O
mill O

in O
the O

Almost O
all O
the O
Jews O
from O

fled B-TER
to O
Levin B-PER
, O
although O
a O
number O
of O
families B-TER
stayed O
with O

On O
Thursday O
, O
June O
26 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
the O
village O

On O
the O
same O
day O
, O
at O
night O
, O
the O
Jews O
returned O
near O
to O
the O
shtetl O

spent O
the O
night O
with O
the O
Jewish O
landowner O
Yitzhok B-PER
Meltz I-PER
, O
half O
a O
kilometer O
from O
the O

However O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
frightened O
to O
enter O
the O
shtetl O
. O

Mrs. B-PER
Pare I-PER
Forman I-PER
went O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
Friday O
June O
27 O
, O
to O
the O
shtetl O
to O
discover O
the O
situation O
therein O
. O

When O
she O
returned O
, O
she O
reported O
that O
the O
shtetl O
was O
completely O
calm O
and O
they O
could O
go O
back O
home O
. O

Upon O
returning O
to O
the O
shtetl O

the O
Jews O
found O
the O
locks O
of O
the O
doors O
torn O
off O

the O
window O
panes O
broken O
, O
and O
their O
best O

the O
local B-TER

The O
best O
homes O
had O
been O
taken O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER

Doctor B-PER
Girdrainys I-PER
immediately O
became O
the O
chief O

The O
manager O
of O
a O
cooperative O
in O
the O
shtetl O
of O
Šaukenai B-LOC
under O
the O

became O
an O
important O
figure O
in O
the O
newly O
created O
shtetl O

His O
name O
– O
Berrotas B-PER

The O
Joćas B-PER
brothers I-PER
also O
joined O
the O
police B-TER
straight O
away O
. O

One O
was O
a O
shoemaker O
; O
the O
other O
brother B-TER
had O
finished O
the O
shtetl O

Folks B-TER

From O
the O
village O

Paveniśies B-LOC

– O
three O
kilometers O
from O

– O
the O
landowner O
Delinninkaitis B-PER
and O
others O

Dozens O
of O
peasants O
from O
the O
villages O
immediately O
began O
to O
sign O
up O
, O
voluntarily O
, O
to O
join O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
partisans B-TER

A O
headquarters O
for O
the O
partisans B-TER
was O
also O
directly O
established O
in O
the O
shtetl O

The O
German B-ORG
military I-ORG
divisions I-ORG
remained O
in O
the O
shtetl O
only O
three O
to O
four O
days O
and O
then O
continued O
their O
advance O
towards O
the O
front O
. O

All O
authority O
remained O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Lithuanians B-TER
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
immediately O
began O
to O
arrest B-TER
young O
Jewish O
men B-TER
who O
had O
a O
link O
to O
the O
young O
communists B-TER
or O
party B-TER
or O
had O
held O
positions B-TER
under I-TER
the I-TER
Soviets I-TER
. O

After O
the O
Germans B-TER
left O
the O
area O
, O
they O
arrested B-TER
the O
Jews O
: O
Feivush B-PER
, O
Zak B-PER
Yitzhok I-PER
, O
Sheitl B-PER
Chaim I-PER

Shultziner B-PER
Efraim I-PER

and O
Furman B-PER
Feyvel I-PER

in O
total O
seven O
men B-TER

The O
partisans B-TER
held O
these O
seven O
in O
the O
shtetl O
prison B-TER
for O
a O
few O
days O
, O
after O
which O
they O
took O
them O
away O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
prison B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
, O
they O
tortured B-TER
them O
murderously O
, O
beat B-TER
them O
, O
and O
then O
shot B-TER
six O
of O
them O
. O

They O
freed O
Moyshe B-PER
Izak I-PER
from O
the O
Šiauliai B-LOC
prison B-TER
and O
he O
remained O
living O
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

Every O
day O
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
drove O
Jews O
from O
their O
homes O
to O
perform O
jobs B-TER
. O

The O
men B-TER
had O
to O
bury B-TER
the I-TER
corpses I-TER
of O
the O
dead B-TER
horses O
, O
put O
in O
order O
the O
destroyed O
roads O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

They O
forced O
the O
women B-TER
to O
clean O
the O
German B-TER
hospital B-TER
, O
wash O
the O
rooms O
and O
windows O
of O
the O
police B-TER
[ O
house O

, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

There O
was O
no O
work B-TER
in O
the O
shtetl O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
Jews O
they O
dug O
out O
work B-TER
The O
word O
is O
missing O
in O
the O
text O
from O
under O
the O
earth O
. O

On O
Shabbat O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
would O
take O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
synagogue B-TER
and O
their O
homes O
, O
give O
them O
brooms O
, O
and O
order O
them O
to O
come O
to O
the O
market O
. O

The O
murderers B-TER
made O
a O
special O
effort O
to O
herd O
the O
religious O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
on O
Shabbat O
. O

Some O
yeshiva O
students O
from O
the O
Kelme B-LOC
yeshiva O
had O
fled O
to O
the O
shtetl O
. O

They O
ordered O
the O
young O
Rabbi B-TER
, O
Rabbi B-PER
Feyvelzon I-PER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
, O
and O
another O
couple O
of O
Rabbis B-TER
from O
Kelme B-LOC
to O
sweep O
quickly O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
of O
the O
exact O
meaning O
here O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
intention O
. O

Farmers B-TER
from O
the O
village O
and O
from O
the O
shtetl O
would O
come O
to O
watch O
the O
Jews O
sweeping O
the O
market O
on O
Shabbat O
and O
laugh B-TER
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
shaved B-TER
off I-TER
half I-TER
the I-TER
beards I-TER
of O
one O
old O
Jew O
from O
the O
shtetl O
, O
Shimen B-PER
Laser I-PER
, O
seventy O
years O
old O
, O
and O
another O
Jew O
from O
Kelme B-LOC
. O

They O
borrowed O
from O
Luba B-PER
Klor I-PER
’s O
home O
shears O
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
herded O
both O
shorn O
Jews O
to O
a O
tavern O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
dance B-TER
and I-TER
sing I-TER
Soviet B-TER
and O
religious O
songs O
. O

Music B-TER
was O
playing O
in O
the O
tavern O
and O
the O
murderers O
made O
merry O
around O
the O
two O
unfortunate O
old O
Jews O
. O

During O
the O
third O
week O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
announced O
to O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
shtetl O
that O
they O
must O
raise O
a O
contribution B-TER
of O
fifty O
thousand O
rubles O
. O

The O
sum O
could O
be O
in O
money O
, O
gold O
, O
silver O
, O
and O
other O
valuable O
items O
. O

The O
contribution B-TER
must O
be O
raised O
in O
six O
hours O
. O

Three O
Jews O
, O
one O
of O
them O
Elye B-PER
Niselevitsh I-PER
– O
a O
textile O
merchant O
– O
raised O
the O
sum O
among O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
shtetl O
. O

All O
Jews O
from O
the O
shtetl O
gathered O
together O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
for O
a O
discussion O
. O

Everyone O
gave O
however O
much O
he O
could O
. O

They O
raised O
thirty O
three O
thousand O
rubles O
in O
cash O
– O
the O
remainder O
in O
valuable O
items O
. O

The O
decree O
concerning O
raising O
a O
contribution B-TER
was O
given O
on O
Shabbat O
in O
the O
third O
week O
of O
the O
war B-TER

The O
Sunday O
and O
Monday O
after O
raising O
the O
contribution B-TER
passed O
calmly O
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
at O
5 O
A.M. O
, O
Luba B-PER
heard O
a O
commotion O
in O
the O
street O
. O

Neighbors O
said O
that O
the O

searching O

They O
knocked O
on O

they O
herded O

Before O

the O

At O

they O
registered O

Many O
of O
the O
Jews O
threw O
their O

For O

the O

so O
on O

The O
Jews O
now O
understood O
for O
what O
reason O
they O
had O
done O
so O
. O

During O

registration B-TER
, O
Lithuanian B-TER
acquaintances I-TER

they O
assured O
the O
Jews O
, O
Anyway O

they O

The O
Jews O
did O
not O
believe O

time O

When O
they O
herded O
them O
into O
the O
synagogue B-TER

placed O

the O

then O
understood O
that O

in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

They O
kept O
the O

with O
the O
children B-TER
up O

, O
into O
the O

and O
closed O
the O

. O

Apart O
from O
the O
four O
men B-TER
they O
also O
left O
the O
shtetl O
’s O
tanner O

They O
herded O
the O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
from O
the O
barn O
out O
to O
the O
farmyard O
and O
arranged O
them O
four O
in O
a O
row O
. O

All O

to O
undress O
to O
their O

and O
they O
were O
commanded O
to O
throw O
their O

onto O
a O
pile O
in O
the O
farmyard O
. O

While O
the O
Jews O
were O
undressing O
, O
Luba B-PER
saw O
the O
known O
lawyer O
, O
the O
Lithuanian B-TER
Kolkhoz B-PER
, O
who O
was O
the O
leading O
murderer B-TER
. O

After O
undressing B-TER
, O
the O
old O
and O
sick B-TER
were O
put O
on O
the O
trucks O
and O
driven O
away O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
took O
two O
young O
women B-TER
, O
Frida B-PER
Niselevitsh I-PER
and O
Basya B-PER
Yavner I-PER
, O
from O
the O
vehicle O
and O
ordered O
that O
they O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
the O
room O
with O
the O
children B-TER
. O

In O
that O
moment O
, O
Frida B-PER
lost O
her O
mind O
. O

They O
herded O
the O
remaining O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
on O
foot O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Šiauliai B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
place O
of O
the O
White O
Cross O
. O

All O
walked O
only O
in O
their O
under B-TER
garments I-TER
. O

A O
grave B-TER
had O
already O
been O
dug O
beyond O
the O
White O
Cross O
. O

They O
led O
all O
the O
Jews O
next O
to O
a O
little O
hill O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
grave B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
ground O
facing O
down O
. O

Talking O
was O
strongly O
forbidden O
; O
they O
threatened O
to O
shoot B-TER
anyone O
who O
did O
so O
. O

The O
murderers B-TER
began O
choosing O
groups O
of O
ten O
, O
which O
they O
then O
took O
them O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
little O
hill O
, O
to O
the O
grave B-TER
. O

Each O
group O
included O
both O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
. O

Luba B-PER
was O
also O
amongst O
those O
Jews O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
little O
hill O
, O
a O
few O
dozen O
meters O
away O
from O
the O
grave B-TER
. O

She O
did O
not O
see O
the O
grave B-TER
, O
because O
it O
was O
among O
shrubs O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
little O
hill O
. O

However O
, O
she O
knew O
that O
after O
taking O
away O
a O
group O
they O
would O
hear O
a O
command O
from O
the O
partisans B-TER
: O
Kaluplis O
Kneel O
! O
. O

They O
would O
hear O
screams O
and O
the O
crying O
of O
women B-TER
; O
straight O
afterwards O
a O
shot B-TER
. O

Luba B-PER
did O
not O
hear O
cries O
from O
the O
men B-TER
. O

After O
the O
shooting B-TER
, O
groans O
and O
the O
wheezing O
of O
the O
wounded O
could O
be O
heard O
. O

Germans B-TER
were O
also O
present O
at O
the O
shooting B-TER
, O
watching O
. O

Luba B-PER
’s I-PER
father B-TER
was O
driven O
to O
the O
grave B-TER
in O
the O
fifth O
group O
of O
ten O
. O

Luba B-PER
should O
have O
been O
among O
the O
next O
group O
of O
ten O
. O

She O
turned O
to O
a O
partisan B-TER
from O
her O
shtetl O
, O
who O
was O
making O
sure O
that O
the O
Jews O
lay O
on O
their O
stomachs O
and O
not O
speak O
, O
and O
said O
to O
him O
, O
What O
is O
going O
on O
here O
, O
they O
undressed O
us O
, O
left O
us O
naked O
, O
and O
shoot O
us O
for O
no O
reason O
, O
for O
nothing O
? O
The O
partisan B-TER
apparently O
was O
struck O
with O
sympathy O
for O
the O
young O
girl B-TER
and O
answered O
Run O
away O
! O
It O
ca O
n’t O
get O
any O
worse O
for O
you O
! O
He O
even O
showed O
Luba B-PER
in O
which O
direction O
she O
should O
Run O
. O

Luba B-PER
made O
a O
run O
for O
it O
and O
took O
off O
into O
the O
forest O
. O

The O
partisan B-TER
pretended O
to O
shoot O
into O
the O
air O
. O

His O
family B-TER
name O
: O
Bertnolos B-PER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
. O

Luba B-PER
ran O
into O
the O
forest O
and O
hid B-TER
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Lying O
in O
the O
forest O
she O
heard O
a O
shot O
following O
the O
command O
. O

That O
Wednesday O
, O
in O
the O
fourth O
week O
of O
the O

, O
they O
shot B-TER
next O
to O
the O

Cross O
one O
hundred O
and O
ninety O
- O
eight O
Jewish O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
( O

. O

From O
the O
forest O
, O
Luba B-PER
fled O
to O
her O
mother B-TER
in O
Šukiškiai B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
fifteen O
women B-TER
and O
four O
men B-TER
were O
still O
confined O
. O

The O
children B-TER
were O
crying O
terribly O
and O
begging O
for O
their O
parents B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
could O
not O
calm O
them O
and O
were O
crying O
their O
eyes O
out O
themselves O
. O

The O
four O
men B-TER
lay O
about O
, O
stony O
and O
lost O
in O
thought O
. O

All O
believed O
everything O
that O
Luba B-PER
told O
them O
: O
furthermore O
, O
they O
themselves O
heard O
the O
shots O
from O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
they O
had O
herded O
the O
Jews O
. O

That O
Wednesday O
night O
was O
a O
terrible O
one O
for O
the O
children B-TER
and O
adults O
in O
the O
room O
. O

The O
entire O
night O
they O
all O
lamented O
and O
wept O
for O
their O
loved O
ones O
and O
relatives B-TER
who O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
. O

Thursday O
morning O
, O
the O
women B-TER
persuaded O
[ O
the O
guards O
] O
that O
they O
should O
let O
them O
and O
the O
children B-TER
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O

They O
took O
most O
of O
the O
Jews O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Svilė B-LOC
, O
to O
Levin B-PER
’s O
courtyard O
. O

Some O
they O
settled O
with O
peasants B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
received O
permission O
to O
go O
to O
the O
shtetl O
for O
three O
days O
and O
take O
possessions O
from O
their O
homes O
. O

The O
best O
things O
had O
already O
been O
stolen O
. O

Local B-TER
peasants I-TER
came O
to O
the O
courtyard O
, O
threatening O
and O
robbing O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
; O
as O
a O
result O
the O
women B-TER
themselves O
asked O
that O
they O
should O
be O
guarded O
. O

Frida B-PER
Niselevitsh I-PER
was O
there O
with O
her O
little O
brother B-TER
, O
Chaim B-PER
. O

She O
walked O
around O
the O
entire O
day O
naked O
, O
crying O
out O
, O
Give O
me O
back O
my O
parents O
! O
She O
walked O
around O
naked O
in O
the O
shtetl O
and O
shattered O
the O
window O
panes O
of O
the O
partisans B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
suffered O
a O
lot O
because O
of O
her O
. O

Luba B-PER
, O
her O
mother B-TER
with O
her O
three O
little O
sisters B-TER
and O
three O
other O
children B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
and O
Leib B-PER
- I-PER
Shneider I-PER
, O

were O
accommodated O
in O
a O
room O
belonging O
to O
a O
farmer B-TER
near O
the O
shtetl O
of O
Naujieji O
Šaukėnai B-LOC
. O

They O
spent O
a O
few O
weeks O
there O
. O

They O
found O
out O
from O
the O
farmers B-TER
that O
the O
partisans B-TER
divided O
among O
themselves O
the O
possessions O
of O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
. O

After O
two O
weeks O
, O
an O
order O
was O
issued O
that O
all O
Jews O
must O
prepare O
themselves O
, O
together O
with O
the O
children B-TER
, O
to O
leave O

. O

The O
Jews O
learned O
from O
the O
shtetl O
priest B-TER
Staševičius B-PER
that O
they O
would O
all O
be O
taken B-TER
to O
Žagarė B-LOC

. O

The O

They O
allowed O
them O
to O
pack O
all O
their O
things O
and O
put O
them O
on O
the O
wagons B-TER
. O

The O
three O
old O
women B-TER
pleaded O
that O
they O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
to O
Žagarė B-LOC
and O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
shoot B-TER
them O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

The O
children B-TER
were O
put O
on O
the O
wagons B-TER
. O

As O
they O
passed O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
asked O
that O
they O
be O
allowed O
to O
visit O
the O
cemetery B-TER
and O
bid O
farewell O
to O
their O
deceased O
friends O
and O

. O

They O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Luba B-PER
, O
together O
with O
another O
fourteen O
young O

, O
was O
taken O
by O

They O
were O
accompanied O
by O
Povilas B-PER
Jočas I-PER
and O
another O
partisan B-TER
. O

As O
they O
passed O
through O
Šiauliai B-LOC
, O
Luba B-PER
saw O
the O
Jews O
assembling O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
wanted O
to O
stay O
there O
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
would O
not O
allow O
it O
. O

As O
they O
passed O
through O
Joniškis B-LOC
( O
Yaneshok B-LOC
) O
, O
[ O
they O
saw O
that O
] O
all O
the O
Jewish O
houses O
were O
closed O
, O
the O
locks O
bolted O
; O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O

had O
already O
been O
taken O

The O
fifteen O
young O

were O
taken O
to O
Žagarė B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
yard O
. O

There O
they O
found O
Jews O
who O

from O
many O
surrounding O
shtetls O

There O
was O
a O
great O
panic O
. O

Povilas B-PER
Jočys I-PER
asked O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
Žagarė B-LOC
police B-TER
, O
who O
had O
come O
to O
the O
courtyard O
, O

to O
all O
these O
Jews O
here O
? O
The O
chief O
answered O
: O
They O
will O
take O
all O
the O
Jews O
from O
the O
surrounding O
shtetls O
to O
Žagarė O
and O
here O
they O
will O
probably O
shoot O
them O
? O
As O
the O
fifteen O
young O
girls B-TER
were O
being O
taken O
away O
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
, O
the O
old O
policeman B-TER
Bernotas B-PER
told O
Jočys B-PER
that O
he O
should O
find O
out O
what O
they O
intended O
to O
do O
with O
the O
Jews O
and O
, O
if O
they O
are O
intending O
to O
shoot B-TER
them O
, O
should O
make O
sure O
to O
bring O
back O
Luba B-PER
Meltz I-PER
, O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
with O
him O
under O
the O
Soviets B-TER
. O

Jočys B-PER
informed O
and O
warned O
Lob B-PER
Meltz I-PER
, O
who O
immediately O
told O
all O
the O
other O
young O
people B-TER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
. O

They O
then O
related O
it O
to O
all O
the O
Jews O
, O
and O
the O
panic O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
courtyard O
increased O
. O

Luba B-PER
Meltz I-PER
, O
Ita B-PER
Broyz I-PER
, O
and O
Shmuel B-PER
- I-PER
Michl I-PER
bribed B-TER
the O
partisan B-TER
Jočys B-PER
, O
who O
took O
all O
three O
back O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Šaukenai B-LOC
and O
set O
them O
free O
. O

Luba B-PER
Klor I-PER
could O
not O
run O
away O
, O
because O
she O
was O
waiting O
for O
her O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
, O
who O
had O
travelled O
by O
wagon B-TER
. O

She O
discovered O
that O
on O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
the O
partisans B-TER
, O
taking O
many O
Jews O
to O
Žagarė B-LOC
, O
shot B-TER
them O
on O
the O
way O
. O

So O
she O
wanted O
to O
know O
what O
had O
become O
of O
her O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
, O
because O
they O
were O
late O
in O
arriving O
. O

She O
left O
the O
synagogue B-TER
yard O
and O
went O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
her O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
. O

A O
farmer B-TER
noticed O
her O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
police B-TER
. O

From O
there O
, O
they O
took O
her O
back O
to O
the O
courtyard O
. O

Luba B-PER
remembers O
well O
that O
they O
brought O
Jews O
from O
Radviliškis B-LOC
( O
Radvikishok B-LOC
) O
, O
Kuršėnai B-LOC
, O
Užventis B-LOC
, O
Vaiguva B-LOC
, O
and O
other O
shtetls O
. O

She O
then O
talked O
with O
Jews O
from O
Kuršėnai B-LOC
, O
who O
told O
her O
that O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
were O
shot B-TER
in O
Kuršėnai B-LOC
on O
the O
spot O
. O

The O
Jews O
from O
all O
the O
shtetls O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
courtyard O
and O
later O
locked O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

On O
Shabbat B-TER
morning O
, O
they O
brought O
with O
wagons B-TER
Jews O
from O
Bazilionai B-LOC
( O
Bazelon B-LOC
) O
. O

Luba B-PER
talked O
with O
them O
. O

These O
included O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
but O
few O
men B-TER
. O

On O
Sunday O
, O
the O
wagons B-TER
with O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
arrived O
. O

Luba B-PER
immediately O
told O
her O
mother B-TER
everything O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
advised O
Luba B-PER
to O
run O
away O
immediately O
. O

She O
added O
: O
Perhaps O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
save O
me O
and O
the O
children O
. O

Go O
! O
They O
placed O
the O
children B-TER
and O
women B-TER
who O
had O
arrived O
in O
a O
synagogue B-TER
across O
the O
street O
. O

On O
Rosh B-TER
Hashana I-TER
, O
Luba B-PER
was O
still O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
prayed O
and O
shed O
rivers O
of O
tears O
. O

The O
panic O
among O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
s O
was O
very O
great O
. O

They O
had O
already O
seen O
with O
their O
own O
eyes O
what O
the O
partisans B-TER
had O
done O
to O
some O
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
their O
shtetls O
. O

The O
Jews O
from O
the O
provinces O
believed O
everything O
that O
the O
young O
women B-TER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
said O
about O
the O
explanation O
given O
by O
the O
Žagarė B-LOC
police B-TER
chief O
. O

The O
Jews O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
s O
were O
not O
given O
food B-TER
or O
drink B-TER
. O

Every O
morning O
and O
every O
evening O
they O
herded O
all O
the O
Jews O
out O
of O
the O
synagogues B-TER
to O
the O
courtyard O
and O
count O
them O
. O

After O
counting O
them O
, O
they O
herded O
them O
back O
into O
the O
synagogues B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
of O
Žagarė B-LOC
, O
children B-TER
, O
and O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
were O
still O
living O
in O
their O
homes O
. O

On O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
, O
their O
representative O
came O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
provincial O
Jews O
. O

He O
reassured O
them O
that O
they O
were O
intending O
to O
establish O
a O
ghetto B-TER
in O
Žagarė B-LOC
, O
where O
all O
the O
Jews O
would O
live O
and O
work B-TER
. O

The O
Šaukenai B-LOC
Jews O
, O
however O
, O
told O
him O
about O
what O
the O
police B-TER
chief O
had O
said O
to O
Jocys B-PER
. O

He O
did O
not O
believe O
them O
and O
calmed O
everyone O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
Žagarė B-LOC
Jews O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
they O
had O
shot B-TER
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
in O
the O
provinces O
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
want O
to O
hear O
about O
it O
and O
warned O
them O
[ O
the O
newcomers O
] O
not O
to O
make O
a O
panic O
. O

In O
the O
synagogues B-TER
the O
partisans B-TER
registered B-TER
all O
Jews O
a O
few O
times O
. O

Tuesday O
, O
exactly O

Following O

Luba B-PER

She O
looked O

No O

The O

had O
mercy B-TER
on O
Luba B-PER
and O
gave O

. O

The O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
was O
afraid O
to O
let O
her O

. O

Luba B-PER

to O
another O

He O
bought O

Returning O

told O
them O
about O
the O

He O

He O

All O

upon O
him O
and O
begged O
him O

The O

He O

The O
first O
period O
passed O
well O
, O
because O
at O
this O
point O
no O
one O
found O
out O
about O
them O
. O

Ita B-PER
Broyz I-PER
’s O
belongings O
were O
with O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
Word O
missing O
in O
the O
text O
in O
a O
village O
not O
far O
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
. O

Ita B-PER
stayed O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
for O
a O
certain O
time O
and O
it O
was O
not O
bad O
for O
her O
. O

After O
he O
was O
investigated O
concerning O
other O
Jews O
, O
they O
told O
her O
that O
they O
could O
not O
keep O
her O
any O
longer O
. O

Ita B-PER
came O
to O
Luba B-PER
’s O
farmer B-TER
, O
Jonas B-PER
Peleckis I-PER
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
wanted O
to O
confirm O
that O
Ita B-PER
was O
with O
Peleckis B-PER
and O
ostensibly O
came O
to O
invite O
her O
to O
come O
to O
[ O
live O
with O
] O
her O
once O
again O
. O

The O
police B-TER
and O
partisans B-TER
discovered O
that O
Jews O
were O
hiding B-TER
in O
the O
villages O
and O
began O
to O
conduct O
searches O
. O

Peleckis B-PER
was O
afraid O
to O
keep B-TER
five I-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
his O
home O
any O
longer O
and O
advised O
them O
to O
approach O
the O
priest B-TER
Staševičius B-PER
for O
help O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
counseled O
the O
five O
young O
people B-TER
to O
become O
Christians B-TER
in O
order O
that O
it O
would O
be O
possible O
to O
find O
them O
places O
with O
farmers B-TER
, O
as O
Christians B-TER
. O

All O
five O
were O
baptized O
. O

Luba B-PER
remained O
living O
in O
a O
room O
in O
the O
priest B-TER
’s I-TER
home O
. O

The O
remaining O
four O
remained O
in O
hiding B-TER
with O
Peleckis B-PER
. O

However O
, O
Luba B-PER
could O
not O
remain O
for O
long O
with O
the O
priest B-TER
because O
he O
simply O
disgusted O
her O
with O
teaching O
her O
the O
laws O
of O
her O
new O
faith O
. O

She O
went O
back O
to O
the O
farmer B-TER
Jonas B-PER
Peleckis I-PER
. O

The O
five O
Jews O
were O
informed B-TER
upon I-TER
to O
the O
shtetl O
police B-TER
a O
few O
times O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
, O
however O
, O
had O
contacts O
with O
the O
police B-TER
. O

Every O
time O
that O
they O
came O
from O
the O
shtetl O
, O
ostensibly O
searching O
for O
Jews O
, O
they O
did O
not O
find O
them O
. O

For O
four O
to O
five O
months O
, O
the O
five O
Jews O
remained O
hiding B-TER
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
Peleckis B-PER
. O

They O
all O
slept O
in O
his O
home O
. O

Once O
, O
a O
Tuesday O
, O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
New O
Year O
1942 O
, O
four O
Jews O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
kitchen O
and O
talking O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
a O
partisan B-TER
from O
the O
shtetl O
came O
into O
the O
house O
, O
Juozas B-PER
Jocas I-PER
. O

He O
sat O
down O
and O
talked O
with O
the O
four O
Jews O
, O
whom O
he O
knew O
well O
from O
the O
shtetl O
. O

Luba B-PER
understand O
that O
he O
had O
come O
for O
a O
reason O
and O
there O
was O
a O
danger O
. O

She O
went O
to O
Soznye B-PER
Kaminetzky I-PER
in O
the O
room O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
, O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
came O
running O
to O
the O
house O
and O
reported O
that O
partisans B-TER
were O
approaching O
the O
village O
. O

She O
told O
them O
that O
six O
Jews O
had O
already O
been O
caught O
in O
another O
place O
. O

Luba B-PER
and O
Sozna B-PER
fled B-TER
from O
the O
house O
. O

They O
heard O
shots B-TER
and O
cries O
. O

The O
arriving O
partisans B-TER
shot B-TER
at O
the O
three O
remaining O
Jews O
, O
who O
tried O
to O
flee B-TER
from O
Peleckis B-PER
’ O
house O
. O

However O
, O
they O
caught O
them O
, O
and O
together O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
, O
arrested B-TER
them O
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
shtetl O
’s O
prison B-TER
. O

Hearing O
the O
shots O
, O
Luba B-PER
and O
Sone B-PER

referred O
to O
sometimes O
as O
Sone O

sometimes O
as O
Sozne O
. O

The O
spellings O
in O
the O
original O
Yiddish O
vary O
. O

threw O
themselves O
into O
a O
valley O
. O

When O
the O
shots O
stopped O
, O
they O
stole O
into O
a O
nearby O
forest O
. O

From O
there O
they O
went O
together O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
. O

On O
this O
occasion O
, O
the O
priest B-TER
did O
not O
know O
that O
partisans B-TER
were O
coming O
to O
the O
village O
and O
could O
not O
protect O
the O
unfortunate O
Jews O
. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
Kolkhoz B-PER
came O
to O
the O
village O
with O
his O
partisans B-TER
from O
the O
shtetl O
of O
Uzventis B-LOC
. O

The O
police B-TER
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
did O
not O
even O
know O
about O
it O
and O
could O
not O
tell O
the O
priest B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
Wednesday O
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
from O
Uzventis B-LOC
came O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
and O
, O
with O
revolvers O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
threatened O
to O
shoot B-TER
him O
if O
he O
would O
not O
tell O
them O
the O
location O
of O
the O
Jews O
whom O
he O
had O
converted B-TER
. O

The O
priest B-TER
answered O
that O
he O
had O
converted B-TER
the O
Jews O
, O
where O
they O
were O
now O
he O
did O
not O
know O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
two O
girls B-TER
were O
lying O
under O
the O
priest B-TER
’s I-TER
bed O
and O
heard O
everything O
. O

They O
had O
threatened O
to O
shoot B-TER
the O
farmer B-TER
Peleckis B-PER
if O
he O
would O
not O
reveal O
the O
location O
of O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
. O

They O
assured O
him O
that O
so O
long O
as O
they O
did O
not O
find O
all O
fifteen O
Jews O
, O
they O
would O
not O
free O
him O
from O
the O
prison B-TER
and O
would O
subsequently O
shoot B-TER
him O
. O

Among O
the O
Jews O
they O
caught O
in O
another O
village O
were O
also O
three O
Jews O
from O
Kelme B-LOC

The O

. O

They O
took O
all O
nine O

to O
the O

of O
the O

. O

The O
murderers B-TER
ordered O
all O
of O
them O
to O
undress O
and O
lie O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

The O
winter O
of O
1941 O
was O
terribly O
cold O
. O

Before O
getting O
undressed B-TER
and O
lying O
in O
the O
snow O
, O
the O
scum O
ostensibly O
promised O
to O
free O
all O

Ita B-PER
Broyz I-PER
did O
not O

. O

They O
beat O
her O
murderously O
with O
the O
butts O
of O
their O
rifles O
until O
she O
fell O
unconscious O
. O

The O
murderers B-TER
tore O
the O
clothes B-TER
from O
her O
unconscious O
body O
. O

They O
ordered O
the O
nine O
to O
lie O
in O
a O
circle O
, O
one O
head O
next O
to O
another O
. O

The O
lawyer B-TER
Kolkhoz B-PER
personally O
shot B-TER
all O
nine O
with O
a O
revolver O
. O

All O
the O
partisans B-TER
who O
carried O
out O
the O
execution B-TER
were O
from O
the O
small O
shtetl O
of O
Uzventis B-LOC
. O

The O
priest B-TER
related O
all O
this O
to O
both O
girls B-TER
. O

A O
few O
of O
the O
partisans B-TER
came O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
and O
reported O
that O
he O
should O
go O
to O
bury B-TER
the O
nine O
baptized B-TER
Jews O

Captured B-TER

and O
they O
brought O
all O
nine O
who O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
to O
the O
priest B-TER
’s I-TER
yard O
. O

He O
interred O
all O
nine O
at O
the O
shtetl O
’s O
Lithuanian B-TER
cemetery B-TER
in O
two O
graves B-TER
. O

Luba B-PER
and O
Sone B-PER
saw O
with O
their O
own O
eyes O
how O
they O
took O
those O
who O
were O
shot B-TER
past O
the O
house O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
lived O
in O
the O
shtetl O
near O
the O
church O
. O

After O
this O
case O
, O
the O
priest B-TER
gave O
the O
girls B-TER
six O
hundred O
rubles O
and O
advised O
them O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Šiauliai B-LOC
ghetto B-TER
. O

Both O
girls B-TER
went O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Spaudžiai B-LOC
, O
four O
kilometers O
from O
the O
shtetl O
and O
hid B-TER
there O
in O
a O
field O
, O
in O
the O
farmer B-TER
’s I-TER
outhouse O
. O

The O
cold B-TER
was O
terrible O
and O
Sone B-PER
’s O
feet O
froze O
. O

She O
had O
already O
firmly O
decided O
to O
throw O
herself O
into O
the O
nearby O
lake O
and O
drown O
. O

Luba B-PER
however O
stopped O
her O
from O
committing O
suicide B-TER
. O

Two O
days O
later O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
hut O
As O
above O
. O

came O
to O
make O
samagon B-TER
( O
brandy B-TER
) O
or O
moonshine B-TER
самогон O
and O
noticed O
the O
two O
frozen O
young O
girls B-TER
. O

He O
brought O
them O
food B-TER
and O
for O
Sone B-PER
a O
pair O
of O
fur O
boots B-TER
. O

However O
, O
he O
would O
not O
let O
them O
remain O
any O
longer O
in O
the O
hut O
. O

The O
girls B-TER
persuaded O
him O
to O
look O
for O
a O
farmer B-TER
who O
would O
hide B-TER
them O
in O
a O
wagon O
of O
straw O
and O
take O
them O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

For O
this O
he O
took O
six O
hundred O
rubles O
. O

Both O
girls B-TER
reached O
the O
ghetto B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
with O
great O
difficulty O
. O

The O
good O
priest B-TER
did O
not O
forget O
them O
and O
very O
often O
sent O
them O
packages O
of O
food B-TER
. O

Luba B-PER
also O
suffered O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

As O
a O
young O
, O
single O
girl B-TER
they O
sent O
her O
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
to O
various O
camps B-TER
for O
the O
hardest O
labor B-TER
. O

So O
it O
was O
in O
the O
peat O
camp B-TER
at O
Bačiŭnai B-LOC
for O
five O
months O
, O
thereafter O
in O
a O
camp B-LOC
near I-LOC
Viduklė I-LOC
, O
together O
with O
another O
fifty O
women B-TER
and O
two O
men B-TER
. O

There O
they O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
choosing O
potatoes B-TER
. O

From O
there O
again O
to O
a O
peat B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Gaudučiai B-LOC
. O

After O
finishing O
the O
peat O
work B-TER
, O
Luba B-PER
was O
sent O
to O
Pavenćiai B-LOC
. O

In O
that O
camp B-TER
they O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
would O
beat O
and O
torture B-TER
the O
Jews O
. O

Luba B-PER
was O
there O
for O
one O
and O
half O
weeks O
and O
decided O
to O
flee B-TER
. O

Luba B-PER
informed O
the O
priest B-TER
about O
her O
decision O
via O
a O
letter B-TER
, O
and O
he O
sent O
a O
farmer B-TER
with O
a O
cart O
to O
collect O
her O
. O

The O
Jewish O
police B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
found O
out O
that O
two O
girls B-TER
were O
intending O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
and O
guarded O
them O
closely O
, O
fearing O
the O
bad O
consequences O
that O
this O
would O
have O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
girls B-TER
went O
out O
to O
work B-TER
and O
labored B-TER
the O
entire O
day O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
the O
Jews O
were O
taken O
back O
from O
work B-TER
by O
cart O
, O
they O
both O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
of O
the O
cart O
and O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
ditch O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
knew O
where O
he O
must O
go O
to O
meet O
them O
with O
his O
cart O
. O

Half O
an O
hour O
after O
they O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
of O
the O
cart O
, O
he O
drove O
up O
to O
them O
and O
took O
both O
girls B-TER
to O
his O
shtetl O
, O
Kursenai B-LOC
, O
and O
hid B-TER
them O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
in O
his O
stable O
. O

Both O
girls B-TER
time O
died O
their O
hair O
during O
this O
time O
. O

A O
farmer B-TER
Fromas B-PER
, O
from O
Kursenai B-LOC
, O
made O
false B-TER
passes I-TER
for O
both O
girls B-TER
. O

Both O
girls B-TER
were O
taken O
in O
by O
a O
farmer B-TER
from O
the O
village O
of O
Nugarės B-LOC
, O
twelve O
kilometers O
from O
Kursenai B-LOC
. O

His O
family B-TER
name O
: O
Povilas B-PER
Hermanas I-PER
Both O
girls B-TER
lived O
freely O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
show O
themselves O
too O
much O
and O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
avoided O
strangers O
. O

For O
the O
farmer B-TER
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
keep O
two O
serving O
girls B-TER
and O
he O
found O
a O
place O
for O
Basya B-PER
Yavner I-PER
with O
another O
farmer B-TER
. O

However O
, O
Basya B-PER
also O
did O
not O
stay O
with O
the O
second O
farmer B-TER
for O
long O
. O

She O
could O
not O
adapt O
to O
the O
farming O
, O
village O
lifestyle O
and O
found O
the O
work B-TER
hard O
. O

She O
went O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
and O
from O
there O
wandered O
around O
the O
villages O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

While O
in O
the O
village O
Aukštelkė B-LOC
Basia B-PER
by O
chance O
became O
acquainted O
with O
a O
Jewish O
young O
man B-TER
in O
hiding B-TER
, O
living O
on O
Aryan B-TER
papers I-TER
. O

They O
began O
to O
meet O
often O
. O

The O
young O
man B-TER
, O
however O
, O
had O
previously O
been O
spending O
time O
with O
a O
Lithuanian B-TER
girl B-TER
, O
who O
became O
jealous O
and O
informed O
on O
her O
beloved O
Jewish O
young O
man B-TER
together O
with O
Basya B-PER
. O

They O
were O
both O
arrested B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

The O
young O
man B-TER
was O
shot B-TER
. O

Basya B-PER
remained O
in O
prison B-TER
until O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
entered O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

She O
, O
together O
with O
two O
other O
Jewish O
women B-TER
who O
had O
been O
imprisoned B-TER
, O
fled B-TER
the O

, O
along O
with O
other O
people B-TER
under O

. O

As O
she O
jumped B-TER
over I-TER
the I-TER
fence I-TER
, O
one O
old O
lady O
broke O
her O
foot O
and O
the O
partisans B-TER
shot B-TER
her O
. O

The O
rest O
fled B-TER
and O
survived B-TER
. O

Among O
them O
was O
also O
Basya B-PER
Yanver I-PER
. O

Luba B-PER
Klor I-PER
remained O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
Hermanas B-PER
. O

She O
endeavored O
at O
every O
opportunity O
to O
learn O
all O
the O
tasks B-TER
involved O
in O
farming O
. O

She O
learned O
not O
only O
all O
the O
women B-TER
’s O
jobs B-TER
but O
also O
to O
plough O
. O

On O
more O
than O
one O
occasion O
, O
the O
householder O
reproached O
his O
own O
wife B-TER
for O
idleness O
and O
relying O
too O
much O
on O
the O
young O
woman B-TER
. O

She O
fed O
the O
pigs O
and O
animals O
, O
milked O
the O
cows O
, O
knitted O
, O
snowed O
, O
and O
did O
not O
rest O
all O
day O
long O
. O

When O
necessary O
, O
she O
also O
ploughed O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
Luba B-PER
. O

There O
too O
, O
more O
than O
once O
she O
lived O
through O
threats O
to O
her O
life O
. O

During O
the O
last O
period O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
became O
wild O
and O
cruel O
. O

The O
search B-TER
for O
hidden B-TER
Jews O
intensified O
, O
due O
to O
the O
fear O
of O
leaving O
Jewish O
witnesses O
alive O
. O

Once O
they O
conducted O
an O
inspection O
in O
the O
village O
and O
looked B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

Shots B-TER
were O
heard O
from O
all O
sides O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
, O
they O
heard O
a O
banging O
on O
the O
door O
of O
Luba B-PER
’s O
house O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
was O
very O
scared O
and O
quickly O
hid B-TER
himself O
. O

Everyone O
in O
the O
house O
was O
sure O
that O
the O
partisans B-TER
had O
discovered O
Luba B-PER
and O
were O
coming O
to O
arrest B-TER
her O
. O

The O
farmer O
’s O
wife B-TER
suggested O
that O
Luba B-PER
jump B-TER
out I-TER
of O
the O
window O
and O
flee B-TER
. O

However O
, O
Luba B-PER
refused O
, O
stating O
that O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
and O
that O
she O
must O
take O
the O
risk O
and O
remain O
in O
the O
house O
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
entered O
the O
house O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
’s O
wife B-TER
was O
very O
scared O
and O
greeted O
them O
with O
a O
cry O
: O
My O
husband O
is O
not O
guilty O
. O

I O
am O
guilty O
of O
everything O
! O
The O
partisans B-TER
did O
not O
understand O
what O
she O
was O
saying O
and O
calmed O
her O
: O
they O
had O
just O
come O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
and O
would O
be O
leaving O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
immediately O
came O
out O
of O
his O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
and O
welcomed O
the O
partisans B-TER
. O

Sitting O
around O
the O
table O
and O
eating O
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
spoke O
angrily O
about O
the O
hidden B-TER
Jews O
, O
who O
could O
still O
, O
God O
forbid O
, O
remain O
as O
living O
witnesses O
against O
the O
Lithuanians B-TER
. O

When O
I O
catch O
a O
Jew O
, O
I O
will O
cut O
him O
into O
shreds O
! O
said O
one O
of O
them O
, O
gnashing O
his O
teeth O
. O

Luba B-PER
was O
lying O
in O
bed O
with O
blankets O
covering O
her O
head O
and O
heard O
everything O
. O

Early O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
the O
partisans B-TER
left O
and O
Luba B-PER
could O
breathe O
freely O
. O

Similar O
cases O
occurred O
on O
many O
occasions O
. O

The O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
quickly O
approached O
the O
village O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 O
. O

The O
front O
, O
however O
, O
came O
to O
a O
standstill O
and O
the O
village O
fell O
into O
the O
neutral O
zone O
. O

Patrols O
of O
both O
Germans B-TER
and O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
soldiers B-TER
came O
to O
the O
village O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
took O
Luba B-PER
with O
a O
cart O
from O
the O
neutral O
zone O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
the O
shtetl O
of O
Kuršėnai B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

The O
village O
in O
which O
she O
had O
been O
hiding B-TER
was O
liberated B-TER
a O
full O
two O
months O
later O
. O

After O
the O
liberation B-TER
, O
Luba B-PER
went O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
and O
thanked O
him O
for O
his O
help O
in O
saving O
her O
life O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
asked O
her O
whether O
she O
remained O
a O
Christian B-TER
, O
went O
to O
church B-TER
etc O
. O

Luba B-PER
told O
him O
openly O
that O
she O
had O
returned O
to O
her O
people B-TER
. O

Itshe O
the O
shtetl O
tanner O
had O
fled B-TER
then O
when O
the O
children B-TER
and O
fifteen O
women B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
Žagarė B-LOC
. O

Later O
Devoyra B-PER
( O
sixteen O
years O
old O
) O
and O
his O
young O
son B-TER
Berke O
, O
aged O
fourteen O
/ O
fifteen O
, O
fled B-TER
to O
him O
in O
the O
village O
from O
Žagarė B-LOC
. O

The O
father B-TER
with O
his O
son B-TER
were O
staying O
with O
a O
farmer B-TER
in O
a O
village O
Traulėnai B-LOC
, O
ten O
- O
twelve O
kilometers O
from O
Šaukenai B-LOC
. O

The O
tanner O
produced O
raw O
animal O
hides O
for O
his O
savior O
. O

The O
farmer B-TER
made O
his O
own O
brandy B-TER
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
came O
to O
the O
farmer B-TER
looking O
for O
brandy B-TER
. O

Itshe O
and O
his O
son B-TER
noticed O
the O
partisans B-TER
coming O
and O
fled B-TER
from O
the O
house O
. O

The O
partisans B-TER
saw O
them O
and O
began O
shooting O
. O

They O
caught O
both O
and O
took O
them O
to O
a O
nearby O
forest O
where O
they O
shot B-TER
them I-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

Luba B-PER
does O
not O
know O
where O
they O
are O
buried B-TER
. O

While O
she O
was O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
, O
Luba B-PER
had O
an O
opportunity O
to O
confirm O
that O
almost O
all O
the O
farmers B-TER
who O
came O
to O
visit O
talked O
about O
the O
Jews O
with O
bitterness O
: O
they O
blamed O
the O
Jews O
for O
helping O
the O
Soviets B-TER
take O
Lithuanians B-TER
to O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

The O
dirty O
Jews O
, O
the O
Zhids O
, O
they O
deserve O
to O
be O
shot O
! O
The O
farmers B-TER
in O
the O
villages O
more O
than O
once O
mentioned O
with O
fury O
the O
Jews O
, O
who O
had O
already O
for O
a O
long O
time O
lain O
decimated O
in O
all O
of O
Lithuania B-LOC
. O

Luba B-PER
can O
relate O
that O
in O
all O
the O
farmers B-TER
’ O
conversations O
concerning O
Jews O
which O
she O
heard O
, O
they O
all O
cried O
, O
Okay O
! O
It O
’s O
good O
that O
they O
have O
exterminated O
all O
the O
Jews O
! O
Apart O

after O

When O

In O

½ O

, O
still O
in O

I O
heard O
footsteps O
in O
the O

then O
it O
rang O
and O
2 O
police B-TER
officers I-TER
demanded O
entrance O

They O
came O
with O
the O
order O
to O
pick O
us O
all O
up O
and O
called O
all O
by O
name O
. O

I O
said O
that O
the O
oldest O
daughter B-TER
was O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
and O
the O
second O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
however O
, O
they O
only O
demanded O
that O
my O
husband B-TER
come O
with O
me O
. O

They O
also O
said O
that O
he O
should O
dress B-TER
warmly O
, O
have O
breakfast B-TER
and O
be O
allowed O
10 O
Marks O
. O

They O
took O
their O
time O
to O
dress B-TER
in O
peace O
, O
to O
pray B-TER
, O
and O
came O
back O
after O
10 O
minutes O
. O

They O
took O
the O
passport B-TER
, O
but O
they O
should O
have O
taken O
me O
with O
them O
, O
too O
, O
but O
they O
wanted O
to O
refrain O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

Then O
my O
husband B-TER
was O
picked O
up O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters I-TER
. O

We O
had O
asked O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
those O
arrested B-TER
, O
the O
officials B-TER
said O
we O
did O
n’t O
need O
to O
get O
upset O
, O
it O
was O
n’t O
something O
that O
affected O
my O
husband B-TER
personally O
, O
but O
a O
general O
action O
against O
the O
Polish B-TER
citizens I-TER

At O
first O
he O
would O
come O
to O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters I-TER

which O
would O
go O
on O
if O
they O
themselves O
did O
not O
know O

Afterwards O
I O
brought O
my O
youngest O
daughter B-TER
to O
school B-TER
. O

When O
I O
came O
onto O
the O
street O
, O
a O
horrible O
picture O
appeared O
: O
everywhere O
policemen B-ORG
who O
led O
Jews B-TER
of O
all O
ages O
and O
sex O
away O
. O

They O
even O
went O
into O
the O
synagogue B-TER
and O
got O
the O
people O
out O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
the O
congregation B-TER
, O
where O
mainly O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
flocked O
together O
, O
as O
well O
as O
stateless B-TER
men O
who O
had O
not O
been O
picked O
up O
. O

In O
the O
congregation B-TER
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
were O
in O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Polish B-LOC
consulates B-TER
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
, O
that O
they O
could O
not O
say O
anything O
at O
the O
moment O
. O

From O
there O
I O
went O
to O
pick O
up O
my O
daughter B-TER
from O
school B-TER
and O
had O
the O
big O
daughter B-TER
try O
to O
call O
the O
daughter B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
so O
that O
she O
would O
come O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
- I-LOC
Altona I-LOC
immediately O
and O
the O
family B-TER
would O
be O
together O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
visit O
my O
husband B-TER
. O

I O
found O
him O
in O
a O
huge O
gymnasium O
where O
hundreds O
of O
people O
had O
already O
gathered O
, O
old O
people O
, O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
babies B-TER
in O

, O

, O
etc O
. O

The O
congregation B-TER
had O
some O
representatives O
there O
, O
they O
had O
sent O
food O
and O
took O
orders O
from O
the O
individuals O
, O
which O
perhaps O
could O
still O
be O
done O

After O
I O
had O
spoken O
to O
my O

wanted O
to O
leave O

the O
guard B-TER
did O
not O

me O
through O

I O
said O
I O
was O
not O
arrested B-TER
at O
all O
, O
but O
only O
visited O
my O
husband B-TER

He O
replied O
that O
he O
did O
n’t O
think O
so O
, O
but O
if O
I O
had O
n’t O
been O
picked O
up O
, O
it O
had O
only O
happened O
by O
mistake O
, O
now O
I O
had O
to O
I O
'll O
stay O
here O
. O

I O
was O
very O
desperate O
because O
my O
children B-TER
did O
not O
know O
where O
I O
was O
, O
I O
turned O
to O
Miss O
Ellern B-PER

She O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
door O
with O
me O
and O
said O
to O
me O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
: O

I O
told O
you O
to O

I O
concealed O

went O
with O
the O
little B-TER

The O

said O
I O

I O
packed O

I O

then O
the O
officer B-TER
let O
me O
go O
down O

several O
times O

where O
several O
people O
had O
to O
go O
through O
posts B-TER
next O
to O
each O
other O
. O

It O
was O
not O
examined O
however O
very O
exactly O
, O
I O
could O
e.g. O
keep O
several O
hundred O
Marks O
with O
me O
. O

Then O
a O
terrible O
march O
of O
about O
7 O
kilometers O
began O
, O
without O
consideration O
of O
the O
physical O
abilities O
of O
the O
individual O
. O

If O
somebody O
could O
not O
carry O
his O
luggage O
or O
fell O
behind O
, O
the O
luggage O
was O
taken O
from O
him O
and O
thrown O
away O
. O

If O
somebody O
could O
not O
keep O
pace O
, O
he O
was O
beaten O
. O

Finally O
we O
reached O
the O
border O
. O

There O
is O
about O
100 O
meters O
of O
no O
man O
’s O
land O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

On O
the O
Polish B-LOC
side O
there O
was O
a O
single O
guard B-TER
with O
a O
rusted O
rifle O
. O

Nobody O
wanted O
to O
let O
him O
through O
. O

But O
the O
Germans B-LOC
pushed O
from O
behind O
and O
pushed O
and O
said O
: O
You O
wo O
n’t O
let O
a O
single O
man O
stop O
you O
! O
Finally O
a O
few O
younger O
men O
formed O
a O
chain O
, O
went O
under O
the O
barrier O
and O
shouted O
to O
the O
Poles B-LOC
: O
Shoot O
us O
. O

The O
Polish B-LOC
side O
then O
shot O
into O
the O
air O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
since O
the O
crowd O
was O
pushing O
and O
the O
barrier O
was O
already O
raised O
, O
the O
whole O
procession O
finally O
reached O
Polish B-LOC
territory O
. O

. O

) O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
negotiations O
were O
going O
on O
there O
somehow O
and O
everyone O
first O
came O
to O
a O
little O
wood O
on O
the O
Polish B-LOC
side O
, O
where O
they O
sat O
down O
tired O
to O
death O
, O
ate O
what O
they O
still O
had O
with O
them O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

From O
approx O
. O

10 O
- O
1 O
o'clock O
we O
were O
in O
the O
wood O
, O
in O
the O
pouring O
rain O
. O

Then O
the O
permission O
of O
the O
Polish B-LOC
government O
arrived O
to O
let O
us O
in O
to O
Sbonczyn B-LOC
. O

So O
we O
were O
able O
to O
leave O
again O
, O
and O
there O
were O
horde O
stables O
provided O
for O
us O
, O
which O
happened O
to O
be O
empty O
. O

We O
were O
accommodated B-TER
there O
, O
as O
good O
as O
it O
could O
be O
, O
and O
some O
people O
from O
other O
cities O
had O
already O
been O
there O
from O
the O
day O
before O
. O

The O
station B-LOC
Neu I-LOC
- I-LOC
Bentschen I-LOC
was O
already O
black O
from O
people O
who O
had O
been O
there O
from O
the O
day O
before O
, O
the O
first O
20 O
to O
30 O
had O
been O
able O
to O
continue O
, O
but O
then O
the O
onward O
journey O
was O
generally O
blocked O
. O

At O
the O
station B-LOC
there O
was O
no O
more O
space O
for O
anyone O
, O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
overcrowded O
. O

We O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
a O
horse O
stable O
, O
or O
more O
correctly O
, O
we O
started O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
there O
. O

My O
husband B-TER
stayed O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
, O
I O
and O
my O
two O
daughters B-TER
went O
up O
to O
the O
hayloft O
because O
it O
seemed O
warmer O
to O
us O
there O
. O

But O
afterwards O
other O
people O
lit O
lights O
there O
, O
and O
it O
became O
too O
flammable O
for O
us O
to O
go O
down O
again O
. O

Meanwhile O
my O
youngest O
daughter B-TER
got O
very O
sick B-TER
and O
I O
went O
outside O
with O
both O
daughters B-TER
. O

There O
, O
my O
older O
daughter B-TER
also O
collapsed O
. O

- O
3 O
- O
Then O
, O
in O
the O
pitch O
blackness O
, O
I O
groped O
my O
way O
further O
for O
some O
help O
and O
accommodation B-TER
. O

I O
heard O
voices O
and O
saw O
a O
light O
and O
finally O
found O
an O
inn B-TER
. O

I O
came O
into O
a O
room B-TER
smoked O
with O
tobacco O
in O
which O
there O
were O
many O
refugees B-TER
. O

The O
children B-TER
, O
who O
were O
almost O
unconscious O
, O
were O
immediately O
put O
on O
two O
cane O
chairs O
and O
we O
got O
hot O
coffee B-TER
. O

Here O
I O
was O
discovered O
by O
chance O
by O
an O
acquaintance O
from O
Duisburg B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
got O
a O
room B-TER
in O
this O
hotel B-TER
only O
yesterday O
. O

He O
said O
there O
was O
unfortunately O
no O
space O
in O
his O
room B-TER
because O
he O
had O
his O
two O
children B-TER
there O
and O
his O
wife B-TER
was O
ill B-TER
. O

But O
there O
was O
another O
vacancy O
next O
to O
his O
room B-TER
, O
because O
the O
owner O
had O
gone O
on O
a O
night O
’s O
journey O
. O

I O
replied O
- O
still O
in O
old O
ideas O
- O
that O
I O
could O
not O
stay O
in O
a O
strange O
room B-TER
. O

But O
he O
said O
that O
that O
was O
not O
the O
point O
now O
. O

Then O
he O
opened O
the O
room B-TER
with O
a O
randomly O
matching O
key O
, O
and O
we O
found O
a O
wonderful O
room B-TER
with O
a O
tiled O
stove O
, O
electric O
light O
, O
two O
large O
beds O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

There O
I O
first O
put O
the O
children B-TER
in O
their O
beds O
, O
and O
then O
I O
went O
in O
search O
of O
milk B-TER
. O

Finally O
I O
found O
a O
farm O
and O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
get O
some O
milk B-TER
. O

They O
even O
warmed O
it O
up O
for O
me O
, O
and O
I O
brought O
the O
milk B-TER
to O
the O
inn B-TER
. O

When O
I O
came O
back O
, O
the O
children B-TER
had O
already O
recovered O
to O
some O
extent O
. O

8 O
. O

) O
The O
accommodation B-TER
was O
such O
that O
everyone O
had O
to O
put O
themselves O
in O
places O
and O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
them O
first O
. O

It O
was O
not O
a O
common O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
accommodation B-TER
with O
families B-TER
in O
the O
village O
, O
but O
the O
whole O
place O
was O
sealed O
off O
by O
the O
police B-TER
and O
none O
of O
us O
was O
allowed O
to O
leave O
it O
. O

Who O
had O
no O
money O
at O
all O
or O
in O
a O
collection B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
which O
was O
set O
up O
in O
two O
mills O
. O

On O
the O
second O
day O
, O
large O
lorries O
with O
food B-TER
came O
from O
the O
Jewish O
places O
in O
Poland B-LOC
, O
distributing O
bread B-TER
, O
butter B-TER
and O
eggs B-TER
. O

Gradually O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
organized O
, O
committees O
were O
formed O
, O
delegates O
of O
the O
organizations B-TER
came O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
head O
was O
Prof. O
Ginsburg B-PER
. O

The O
committee O
then O
took O
over O
the O
payment O
of O
all O
rents O
, O
field B-TER
kitchens I-TER
were O
set O
up O
, O
clothing B-TER
for O
the O
winter O
came O
, O
etc O
. O

, O
etc O
. O

Of O
course O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
until O
the O
distribution O
was O
organized O
properly O
. O

We O
could O
n’t O
stomach O
the O
food B-TER
from O
the O
field B-TER
kitchen I-TER
, O
but O
since O
we O
still O
had O
some O
money O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
manage O
the O
necessities O
ourselves O
. O

9 O
. O

) O
There O
were O
some O
young O
people O
together O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
Mizrahi B-ORG
. O

Their O
meeting O
room O
was O
our O
room O
, O
the O
largest O
and O
brightest O
. O

They O
thought O
of O
writing O
to O
the O
Palestine B-TER
Office I-TER
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
and O
asking O
for O
certificates B-TER
. O

After O
some O
consideration O
they O
changed O
the O
plan O
and O
asked O
for O
certificates B-TER
for O
the O
parents B-TER
. O

We O
adults O
considered O
this O
attempt O
to O
be O
ridiculous O
. O

The O
children B-TER
prepared O
15 O
applications O
and O
sent O
them O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

Already O
after O
3 O
days O
an O
emissary O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
Dr. O
Wilhelm B-PER
, O
came O
and O
recorded O
more O
detailed O
personal O
data O
. O

And O
after O
a O
very O
short O
time O
we O
were O
informed O
by O
telephone O
that O
our O
certificate B-TER
had O
been O
approved O
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
know O
why O
our O
certificate B-TER
was O
granted O
, O
maybe O
it O
was O
connected O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
were O
known O
from O
Mizrahi B-ORG
work I-ORG
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
maybe O
also O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
eldest O
daughter B-TER
was O
already O
in O
Palestine B-LOC
and O
that O
we O
had O
two O
children B-TER
here O
. O

In O
total O
, O
however O
, O
only O
5 O
certificates B-TER
were O
given O
for O
the O
approximately O
6500 O
refugees B-TER
in O
Sbonczyn B-LOC
at O
that O
time O
. O

We O
got O
one O
of O
them O
. O

The O
passports B-TER
were O
immediately O
taken O
from O
us O
, O
sent O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
and O
so O
on O
. O

At O
the O
last O
moment O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
our O
older O
daughter B-TER
, O
because O
already O
over O
18 O
, O
could O
not O
come O
with O
us O
. O

So O
at O
first O
I O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
travel O
, O
but O
I O
was O
forced O
at O
gunpoint O
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
demanded O
that O
we O
should O
travel O
, O
she O
herself O
would O
somehow O
get O
through O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
about O
3 O
weeks O
later O
, O
she O
arrived O
with O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Aliya B-TER
Bet I-TER
, O
on O
the O
first O
Greek B-TER
ship I-TER
to O
dock O
in O
Nahariyya B-LOC
. O

We O
left O
Sbonczyn B-LOC
on O
December O
22nd O
, O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
any O
money O
left O
at O
all O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
trip O
and O
equipment O
was O
paid O
for O
by O
the O
Jewish O
public O
authorities O
in O
Poland B-LOC

I O
received O

18.10.45 O
My O
dear O
ones O
, O
this O
time O
, O
as O
an O
exception O
, O
I O
am O
writing O
you O
in O
German O
. O

For O
this O
letter B-TER
, O
which O
will O
probably O
be O
very O
long O
, O
is O
not O
just O
for O
our O
dear O
friends O
who O
have O
written O
so O
cordially O
to O
us O
– O
that O
is O
, O
for O
Anny O
, O
Josef O
, O
Alfred O
, O
the O
Wintersteins B-PER
– O
but O
also O
for O
all O
the O
many O
others O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
read O
Czech O
, O
others O
not O
English O
. O

Do O
n’t O
be O
angry O
that O
I O
report O
so O
collectively O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
technically O
, O
but O
also O
emotionally O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
to O
keep O
telling O
these O
terrible O
things O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Before O
I O
report O
about O
us O
, O
I O
want O
to O
narrate O
in O
general O
about O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Because O
that O
is O
where O
we O
left O
most O
of O
our O
common O
friends B-TER
in O
May O
1944 O
, O
whom O
we O
unfortunately O
have O
mostly O
not O
seen O
again O
. O

You O
will O
have O
heard O
and O
read O
more O
than O
enough O
about O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

You O
probably O
do O
n’t O
know O
much O
about O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
bad O
. O

Especially O
because O
if O
our O
people O
had O
had O
some O
good O
will O
, O
it O
could O
have O
become O
a O
very O
tolerable O
social O
construct O
. O

We O
really O
had O
self B-TER
- I-TER
administration I-TER
, O
it O
was O
absolutely O
not O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

But O
as O
it O
was O
, O
it O
became O
a O
morass O
of O
corruption O
and O
arbitratiness O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
very O
clearly O
distinguished O
castes O
: O
1./ O
The O
prominent O
persons O
( O
this O
is O
not O
ridicule O
, O
but O
die O
Prominenten O
was O
the O
official O
designation O
) O
, O
their O
favorites O
, O
and O
their O
hangers O
- O
on O
. O

– O
2./ O
The O
hard O
workers B-TER
, O
including O
doctors B-TER
and O
caregivers O
. O

– O
3./ O
The O
old O
and O
those O
unable O
to O
work B-TER
. O

– O
The O
first O
group O
lived O
in O
luxury O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
was O
protected O
from O
the O
feared O
transports B-TER
to O
unknown O
destinations O
. O

– O
The O
second O
group O
earned O
money O
with O
great O
difficulty O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
acquired O
its O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
was O
not O
all O
too O
hungry B-TER
, O
if O
never O
entirely O
sated O
. O

– O
The O
third O
group O
starved B-TER
already O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
if O
they O
had O
no O
connections O
to O
Group O
1 O
. O

– O
So O
only O
one O
segment O
had O
it O
really O
bad O
there O
. O

But O
the O
people O
behaved O
as O
if O
everything O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
life O
and O
death O
, O
like O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
completely O
ruthlessly O
and O
demoralized O
. O

I O
can O
say O
with O
pride O
that O
our O
mutual O
friends O
were O
among O
the O
very O
few O
left O
to O
the O
old O
, O
Dr. O
Lederer B-PER
- I-PER
Beers I-PER
, O
Dr. O
Erwin B-PER
Langs I-PER
, O
Dr. O
Alts B-PER
, O
Igel O
and O
Rita O
, O
Dr. O
Tschiassnys B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Reisz B-PER
. O

None O
of O
these O
ever O
returned B-TER
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
about O
Igel O
and O
Rita O
. O

But O
both O
were O
very O
ill B-TER
. O

– O
Most O
of O
these O
friends B-TER
did O
not O
come O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
until O
October O
44 O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
one O
prominent O
person O
after O
the O
other O
was O
called O
in O
and O
shot O
dead B-TER
: O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
Dr. B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
, O
later O
Zucker B-PER
, O
Friedmann B-PER
, O
Epstein B-PER
/Berlin O
, O
Krämer B-PER
, O
unfortunately O
also O
Dr. B-PER
Kahn I-PER
and O
his O
wife B-TER
, O
who O
had O
long O
suffered O
severe O
depression O
. O

All O
of O
these O
prominent O
persons O
, O
who O
knew O
too O
much O
, O
had O
to O
pay O
so O
dearly O
for O
their O
privileged O
position O
. O

When O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
then O
liquidated B-TER
, O
the O
rest O
were O
arrested B-TER
as O
all O
- O
too O
- O
eager O
slavedrivers O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

– O
Of O
our O
closer O
acquaintances O
, O
the O
following O
have O
returned B-TER
: O
my O
brother B-TER
Hans O

Dear O
Alfred O
, O
it O
is O
great O
good O
fortune O
that O
you O
decided O
so O
quickly O
back O
then O
. O

– O
The O
returned O
doctors B-TER
probably O
have O
good O
prospects O
of O
opening O
private O
practices O
, O
but O
a O
managing O
position O
in O
a O
hospital B-TER
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O

I O
am O
very O
curious O
whether O
and O
how O
you O
have O
decided O
. O

Unfortunately O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
hope O
, O
dear O
Anny O
, O
that O
Sidy O
will O
turn O
up O
. O

I O
was O
often O
together O
with O
her O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

She O
looked O
good O
and O
well O
cared O
for O
, O
had O
an O
easy O
, O
profitable O
position O
as O
seamstress O
in O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
, O
and O
lived O
relatively O
very O
well O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
when O
she O
left O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
from O
Sept. O
42 O
to O
May O
44 O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
generally O
depressing O
conditions B-TER
, O
we O
had O
terrible O
private O
misfortune O
: O
we O
came O
immediately O
in O
the O
transports B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Lissi O
came O
down O
with O
a O
severe O
scarlet B-TER
fever I-TER
and O
then O
jaundice B-TER
, O
so O
that O
she O
lay O
for O
3 O
months O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
hungry B-TER
and O
miserable O
. O

This O
misfortune O
was O
our O
good O
fortune O
, O
because O
it O
meant O
we O
escaped B-TER
the O
transports B-TER
. O

But O
my O
father B-TER
, O
Irka O
, O
and O
Lore O
, O
and O
many O
friends O
had O
to O
die B-TER
. O

– O
We O
were O
all O
three O
heavy O
laborers B-TER
. O

I O
worked O
in O
the O
laundry O
, O
Lissi O
as O
a O
nurse B-TER
on O
the O
infections B-TER
ward I-TER
, O
Franzi O
in O
agriculture B-TER
. O

In O
Spring O
43 O
, O
Erwin O
and O
Lizzi O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Lizzi O
worked O
with O
me O
in O
the O
laundry O
, O
was O
brave O
, O
hardworking O
, O
and O
indescribably O
goodhearted O
. O

At O
Pentecost B-TER
43 O
a O
terrible O
misfortune O
happened O
. O

Franzi O
, O
who O
had O
had O
an O
unexplained O
fever B-TER
for O
weeks O
– O
probably O
an O
undiagnosed O
scarlet B-TER
fever I-TER
– O
jumped B-TER
one O
night O
from O
the O
2nd O
upper O
storey O
of O
her O
barracks O
and O
lay O
there O
with O
a O
broken O
pelvis O
and O
smashed O
ankles O
. O

She O
had O
no O
reason O
at O
all O
to O
do O
this O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
the O
best O
harmony O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
magnificent O
fiance O
, O
whom O
she O
loved O
very O
much O
. O

She O
was O
suspended O
between O
life O
and O
death O
for O
a O
half O
a O
year O
. O

She O
got O
typhoid B-TER
fever I-TER
as O
well O
. O

But O
this O
misfortune O
was O
our O
good O
fortune O
, O
too O
. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
transport B-TER
again O
, O
and O
again O
we O
got O
out O
of O
it O
. O

But O
Lizzi O
, O
Erwin O
, O
Franzi O
's O
boy O
went O
and O
were O
lost B-TER
. O

Franzi O
recovered O
, O
despite O
all O
the O
predictions O
of O
the O
doctors B-TER
, O
and O
is O
more O
beautiful O
and O
in O
better O
condition O
than O
ever O
, O
she O
's O
just O
easily O
fatigued O
. O

So O
we O
did O
n’t O
come O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
until O
May O
44 O
. O

We O
were O
glad O
to O
go O
, O
because O
we O
looked O
forward O
to O
seeing O
our O
loved O
ones O
, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
did O
n’t O
know O
that O
it O
was O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
learned O
immediately O
that O
they O
were O
all O
dead B-TER
. O

Franzi O
withstood O
this O
shock O
wonderfully O
, O
Lissi O
less O
so O
. O

I O
had O
to O
be O
brave O
for O
all O
three O
of O
us O
. O

Our O
transport B-TER
was O
the O
first O
that O
was O
mustered O
out O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
about O
2 O
months O
after O
our O
arrival O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
was O
rejected O
because O
I O
looked O
terrible O
. O

But O
I O
came O
along O
anyway O
and O
so O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Christianstadt B-LOC
, O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
biggest O
munitions O
factory B-TER
. O

This O
was O
a O
subdivision O
of O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
Gross B-LOC
- I-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
. O

Until O
the O
Fall O
, O
we O
maintained O
more O
or O
less O
. O

But O
with O
the O
cold B-TER
, O
our O
hunger B-TER
became O
intolerable O
. O

And O
when O
we O
were O
evacuated B-TER
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
February O
45 O
, O
it O
got O
catastrophic O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
this O
miserable O
hike B-TER
, O
the O
children B-TER
and O
I O
resolved O
we O
would O
rather O
be O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
trying O
to O
escape B-TER
than O
exhausted O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

We O
were O
not O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

We O
went O
without O
bread B-TER
, O
without O
papers O
, O
clothed B-TER
in O
shreds O
of O
rags O
right O
through O
Germany B-LOC
on O
the O
border O
between O
Silesia B-LOC
and O
Brandenburg B-LOC
, O
always O
eastward O
toward O
the O
sun O
and O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
artillery O
on O
the O
nearby O
front O
, O
toward O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

/ O
The O
other O
refugees B-TER
had O
turned O
to O
the O
West O
, O
away O
from O
the O
front O
. O

/ O
Farmers B-TER
took O
pity O
on O
us O
and O
let O
us O
spend O
the O
night O
in O
the O
cattle O
stall O
, O
as O
we O
asked O
, O
and O
gave O
us O
food B-TER
, O
which O
we O
never O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
. O

On O
the O
6th O
day O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
German B-TER
front I-TER
fleeing O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
dire O
danger O
, O
when O
a O
single O
call O
would O
cost O
us O
our O
lives O
, O
the O
only O
Catholic B-TER
church I-TER
in O
the O
whole O
area O
was O
the O
first O
building O
that O
opened B-TER
its I-TER
doors I-TER
to O
us O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
, O
whom O
we O
told O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
took O
us O
in O
and O
hid B-TER
us O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
Germans B-TER
quartered I-TER
in O
the O
building O
. O

We O
received O
from O
him O
and O
the O
others O
in O
the O
building O
wonderful O
, O
warm O
quarters O
, O
fantastic O
food B-TER
, O
linens O
, O
clothed B-TER
, O
and O
shoes O
; O
they O
did O
all O
this O
so O
cheerfully O
and O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
even O
though O
they O
themselves O
were O
in O
need O
and O
danger O
. O

This O
change O
from O
darkness O
to O
light O
was O
our O
most O
staggering O
experience O
of O
these O
years O
. O

After O
a O
week O
, O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
there O
. O

After O
7 O
weeks O
, O
we O
had O
recovered O
enough O
to O
work O
as O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
as O
linens O
seamstresses O
in O
the O
military B-TER
workshops B-TER
, O
i.e. O
, O
we O
traveled O
along O
barely O
behind O
the O
front O
, O
where O
we O
had O
lots O
of O
work O
, O
but O
wonderful O
treatment O
and O
plenty O
of O
food B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
April O
, O
we O
joined O
a O
column O
of O
people O
returning O
to O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
and O
arrived O
in O
Ostrau B-LOC
in O
mid- O
June O
after O
a O
march O
of O
350 O
kilometers O
. O

Franzi O
soon O
moved O
to O
Prague B-LOC
; O
she O
is O
an O
assistant O
to O
Erich B-PER
Ziffer I-PER
, O
who O
returned O
from O
Russia B-LOC
. O

They O
lost O
their O
son B-TER
, O
who O
was O
a O
Russian B-ORG
soldier I-ORG
. O

Lissi O
finished O
her O
old O
high B-TER
school I-TER
within O
3 O
months O
, O
took O
her O
final O
examination O
with O
honors O
and O
has O
matriculated O
at O
the O
Technical B-TER
University I-TER
here O
to O
become O
an O
engineer O
. O

She O
already O
knows O
the O
required O
languages O
– O
Spanish O
and O
Russian O
in O
addition O
to O
those O
learned O
at O
the O
school B-TER
. O

Both O
children B-TER
learned O
Russian O
at O
my O
wish O
back O
then O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
rescued B-TER
us O
. O

Because O
otherwise O
we O
would O
n’t O
have O
risked O
fleeing O
toward O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

– O
So O
we O
have O
been O
in O
Prague B-LOC
for O
14 O
days O
now O
. O

We O
have O
strenuous O
months O
behind O
us O
trying O
to O
replace O
our O
destroyed O
documents O
. O

Our O
name O
is O
now O
Šorková B-PER
– O
after O
Schorek B-PER
[ O
an O
old O
nickname O
of O
Josef B-PER
Schornstein I-PER
] O
. O

We O
ca O
n’t O
think O
about O
emigrating B-TER
now O
, O
this O
is O
not O
allowed O
because O
of O
the O
shortage O
of O
workers O
. O

We O
thank O
you O
all O
, O
especially O
you O
, O
dear O
Rufus O

for O
your O
willingness O
to O
help O

It O
is O
very O

and O

you O
can O
help O
us O
with O
stockings B-TER
, O
gloves B-TER
, O
oil O

n’t O
be O
angry O

residing O

tells O
about O
the O
Hotel O
for O
Jews O
that O
was O
set O
up O
by O
Germans B-TER
in O
cooperation O
with O
the O
Jewish O
Gestapo B-ORG
men O
. O

In O
May O
1943 O
, O
the O
news O
came O
that O
Jews O
who O
were O
foreign B-TER
citizens I-TER
could O
leave O
the O
country O
. O

This O
was O
a O
trap O
for O
Jews O
who O
were O
settled O
or O
in O
hiding B-TER
on O
the O
Aryan B-TER
side O
. O

There O
were O
( O
it O
was O
said O
) O
certificates O
at O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
for O
Jews O
who O
had O
died B-TER
in O
action O
, O
Germans B-TER
making O
it O
convenient O
for O
the O
Jews O
who O
had O
survived O
, O
sold O
citizenships B-TER
and O
with O
that O
underhanded O
method O
caught O
the O
naïve O
ones O
. O

There O
were O
two O
types O
of O
documents O
which O
were O
supposed O
to O
provide O
their O
holders O
security O
: O
certificates O
issued O
by O
British O
authorities O
, O
authorizing O
entry O
to O
Palestine O
, O
and O
the O
passports O
of O
the O
Latin O
American O
countries O
. O

At O
the O
head O
of O
this O
scam O
was O
a O
Jewish O
Gestapo B-ORG
officer O
named O
Lolek B-PER
Skosowski I-PER
, O
a O
resident O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
( O
who O
lived O
until O
the O
last O
minute O
in O
Lwów B-LOC
at O
4 B-LOC
Teresy I-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
was O
killed B-TER
by O
the O
party O
) O
, O
who O
sacrificed O
his O
own O
family B-TER
to O
underscore O
the O
trustworthiness O
of O
this O
program O
, O
having O
taken O
them O
out O
of O
the O
Łódź B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

Naïve O
people O
were O
recruited O
at O
the O
Hotel O
Polski O
on O
Długa O

At O
the O
gate O
there O
was O
an O

– O
guard O

who O
kept O
order O
and O
chased O
away O
onlookers O
. O

The O
richest O
Jews O
fell O
victim O
to O
this O
, O
who O
would O
pay O
several O
hundred O
thousand O
złotys O
each O
for O
a O
certificate O
. O

They O
came O
with O
their O
fancy O
baggage O
. O

There O
was O
a O
restaurant O
and O
barber O
shop O
right O
there O
. O

The O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
felt O
as O
if O
they O
were O
on O
a O
fancy O
ship O
. O

A O
committee O
was O
formed O
from O
among O
the O
Jews O
, O
which O
took O
care O
of O
orphaned B-TER
children B-TER
who O
were O
allegedly O
supposed O
to O
leave O
for O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
big O
- O
heartedness O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
poor O
orphans B-TER
were O
accepted O
in O
exchange O
for O
payments O
in O
- O
kind O
and O
similar O
arrangements O
. O

Transports B-TER
were O
sent O
depending O
on O
how O
many O
naïve O
people O
were O
taken O
in O
. O

There O
were O
three O
such O
transports B-TER
. O

The O
first O
was O
to O
Wittel B-LOC
Wittel O
– O
Vittel O
, O
a O
spa O
town O
in O

Group O

, O
from O
whence O

even O
sent O
, O
the O
second O
went O
to O
Hannover B-LOC
, O
the O
third O
and O
last O
to O
Pawiak B-LOC

Further O
groups O
of O
residents O
of O
Hotel O
Polski O
were O
deported O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
at O
Bergen‑Belsen O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
there O
ceased O
to O
be O
any O
news O
. O

A O
card O
from O
Hannover B-LOC
came O
from O
one O
woman B-TER
, O
written O
in O
an O
arranged O
code O
to O
her O

which O
unmasked O
the O
enormity O
of O
the O
scam O

namely O
the O
sentence O
we O
are O
doing O
very O
well O
was O
to O
mean O
the O
group O

extermination B-TER

The O
last O
transport B-TER
did O
not O
go O
far O
, O
only O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
known O
as O
Pawiak B-LOC
, O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
people O
were O
killed B-TER

The O
hotel O
scam O
caught O
about O
3,000 O
people O
from O
the O

German B-TER
factory B-TER
in O
the O
Jewish O
ghetto B-LOC
in I-LOC
Warsaw I-LOC
( O

. O

It O
was O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
so O
called O
Aussiedlung O
. O

The O
transporting B-TER
of O
Jews O
out O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
had O
been O
continuing O
for O
two O
months O
already O
. O

Around O
half O
past O
four O
in O
the O
afternoon O
a O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
officers I-TER
and O
Ukrainians B-TER
arrived O
at O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
ordered O
everyone O
to O
go O
outside O
into O
the O
yard O
and O
from O
there O
marched O
us O
to O
Umschlagplatz O
. O

We O
were O
a O
group O
of O
200 O
persons O
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
also O
among O
us O
. O

The O
Umschlagplatz O
was O
full O
of O
people O
. O

I O
was O
held O
in O
the O
area O
for O
around O
an O
hour O
and O
then O

Around O
six O
o’clock O
in O
the O
evening O
the O
train B-TER
left O
in O
an O
unknown O
direction O
. O

We O
travelled O
in O
crowded O
conditions O
until O
seven O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

The O
journey O
was O
horrible O
because O
the O
thirst B-TER
drove O
us O
simply O
to O
madness O
, O
sweat O
was O
dripping O
from O
us O
because O
of O
the O
heat B-TER
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day O
the O

At O
seven O
in O
the O

we O
arrived O
to O
a O
train B-TER
station O
called O
Treblinka B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
, O
the O
transport B-TER
was O
divided O
into O
three O
parts O
of O
20 O
cars B-TER
each O
, O
and O
20 O
cars B-TER
were O
sent O
to O
a O
railway O
line O
on O
the O
side O
that O
led O
to O
the O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
a O

, O
which O
was O
called O
SS B-LOC

Sonderkommando I-LOC
Treblinka I-LOC
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
train B-TER
stopped O
by O
a O
platform O
, O
there O
were O
two O
barracks O
next O
to O
it O
. O

Not O
far O
from O
the O
barracks O
there O
was O
a O
yard O
fenced O
with O
barbed O
wire O
. O

The O
whole O
platform O
and O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
had O
barbed O
- O
wire O
fences O
, O
usually O
with O
wire O
- O
poles O
and O
also O
a O
wire O
- O
net O
over O
them O
. O

On O
the O
platform O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
of O
previous O
transports B-TER
, O
80 O
men B-TER
, O
waited O
for O
us O
. O

40 O
men B-TER
worked B-TER
on O
the O
platform O
, O
that O
is O
, O
they O
opened O
the O
cars B-TER
, O
told O
the O
people O
to O
get O
out O
, O
removed O
the O
bodies B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
dead I-TER
from O
the O
cars B-TER
and O
cleaned O
up O
the O
railway O
in O
general O
. O

This O
group O
carried O
blue O
bands O
on O
their O
left O
arm O
and O
were O
called O
Blau O
Kommando O
. O

The O
other O
40 O
men B-TER
worked B-TER
in O
the O
yard O
, O
where O
the O
transport B-TER
was O
sent O
in O
order O
to O
undress B-TER
themselves O
. O

They O
carried O
red O
armbands O
. O

During O
all O
this O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
would O
come O
and O
beat O
us O
murderously O
with O
whips O
and O
sticks O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
yard O
the O
unit O
with O
the O
red O
armbands O
called O
out O
that O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
left O
and O
men B-TER
to O
the O
right O
. O

The O
women B-TER
then O
went O
to O
the O
left O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
barrack O
, O
and O
the O
men B-TER
to O
the O
right O
to O
another O
barrack O
, O
where O
everyone O
was O
made O
to O
stand O
in O
lines O
. O

The O
Rot O
Kommando O
then O
shouted O
to O
the O
women B-TER
to O
remove O
their O
shoes B-TER
and O
tie O
them O
up O
securely O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
string O
. O

Those O
who O
did O
n’t O
have O
any O
string O
were O
given O
some O
. O

Then O
the O
women B-TER
were O
allowed O
to O
enter O
into O
the O
barrack O
: O
at O
the O
entrance O
the O
shoes O
were O
tied O
together O
and O
put O
aside O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
did O
not O
happen O
without O
the O
savage O
beatings O
. O

There O
was O
one O
German B-TER
from O
Frankfurt B-LOC
among O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
his O
name O
was O
Sepp B-PER
Hitreider I-PER
. O

He O
was O
especially O
active O
in O
mistreating O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
he O
once O
said O
something O
to O
a O
child B-TER
and O
the O
child B-TER
did O
not O
understood O
him O
, O
he O
grabbed O
the O
child B-TER
by O
the O
little O
legs O
and O
threw O
him O
against O
the O
wall O
smashing O
his O
head O
. O

He O
would O
give O
a O
kick O
a O
pregnant O
woman B-TER
to O
her O
belly O
so O
she O
would O
immediately O
[ O
.. O
? O
] O
or O
simply O
fall O
dead B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
, O
so O
that O
there O
were O
many O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
around O
the O
barracks O
. O

Women B-TER
were O
so O
gravely O
injured O
that O
they O
were O
being O
unable O
to O
walk O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bath O
. O

In O
the O
barrack O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
Rot O
Kommando O
told O
the O
women B-TER
to O
dress B-TER
down I-TER
naked O
. O

The O
undressing B-TER
did O
not O
happen O
without O
the O
murderous O
beatings O
. O

When O
a O
part O
of O
the O
women B-TER
understood O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
they O
started O
to O
wail O
. O

Then O
a O
German B-TER
came O
in O
and O
held O
a O
speech O
, O
telling O
them O
not O
to O
be O
afraid O
, O
nothing O
bad O
would O
not O
happen O
to O
anyone O
, O
the O
women B-TER
would O
only O
be O
bathed O
and O
then O
receive O
new O
clothes B-TER
and O
leave O
for O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
occasion O
he O
also O
announced O
that O
all O
the O
documents O
and O
gold O
jewelry O
had O
to O
be O
deposited O
at O
a O
cashier O
’s O
and O
that O
these O
things O
would O
be O
given O
back O
later O
. O

The O
women B-TER
were O
then O
sent O
to O
a O
hairdresser O
, O
where O
their O
hair O
was O
shaved O
short O
. O

( O
By O
the O
way O
, O
the O
hair O
was O
later O
picked O
up O
, O
disinfected O
and O
sent O
away O
in O
freight O
cars O
. O

) O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
men B-TER
were O
ordered O
to O
undress B-TER
completely O
, O
only O
holding O
their O
shoes O
, O
documents O
and O
valuables O
in O
their O
hands O
. O

While O
undressing B-TER
, O
the O
unfortunate O
were O
murderously O
and O
sadistically O
beaten O
, O
especially O
by O
a O
certain O
Kurt B-PER
Franz I-PER
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
the O
vice O
commander O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
who O
set O
his O
dog O
Bari O
on O
the O
unfortunate O
ones O
and O
their O
skin O
was O
being O
torn O
away O
. O

After O
leaving O
their O
shoes O
on O
the O
ground O
there O
, O
the O
men B-TER
were O
led O
to O
a O
side O
alley O
, O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
called O
Himmelgasse O
. O

The O
men B-TER
had O
to O
run O
all O
the O
way O
, O
about O
300 O
metres O
. O

This O
way O
led O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
alley O
there O
was O
a O
cashier O
’s O
booth O
, O
where O
all O
things O
had O
to O
be O
left O
. O

A O
Jew O
, O
also O
a O
victim B-TER
, O
had O
to O
select O
20 O
- O
30 O
men B-TER
that O
were O
in O
the O
best O
health O
from O
among O
the O
running O
ones O
. O

They O
were O
stopped O
and O
made O
to O
carry O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
transport B-TER
that O
had O
just O
arrived O
to O
a O
designated O
place O
. O

This O
group O
was O
beaten O
especially O
savagely O
. O

The O
dog O
was O
tearing O
away O
pieces O
of O
flesh O
, O
they O
were O
beaten O
with O
shovels O
and O
metal O
rods O
. O

After O
finishing O
the O
work O
that O
was O
assigned O
to O
them O
, O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
alley O
. O

I O
want O
to O
add O
that O
the O
unfortunate O
ones O
were O
thirsty O
and O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
drink O
. O

Water O
was O
available O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
guarded O
the O
pumps O
and O
did O
not O
permit O
to O
swallow O
even O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
ones O
begged O
them O
: O
A O
little O
water O
and O
then O
you O
can O
shoot O
us O
. O

Right O
after O
the O
men B-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
were O
brought O
. O

When O
the O
alley O
ended O
, O
a O
building O
appeared O
before O
the O
eyes O
, O
it O
was O
partly O
made O
of O
stone O
and O
partly O
of O
wood O
, O
of O
a O
beautiful O
style O
, O
with O
flowers O
around O
a O
huge O
star O
of O
David O
on O
the O
roof O
. O

People O
were O
brought O
into O
this O
building O
when O
they O
had O
to O
take O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bath O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
building O
, O
a O
group O
of O
Ukrainians B-TER
would O
usually O
wait O
for O
them O
. O

One O
of O
them O
especially O
stood O
out O
from O
the O
others O
. O

His O
specialty O
was O
torturing O
women B-TER
, O
whose O
breasts O
or O
ears O
he O
would O
cut O
off O
, O
or O
very O
often O
rape B-TER
them O
in O
front O
of O
everybody O
. O

There O
was O
no O
end O
to O
the O
wailing O
and O
the O
shouting O
. O

The O
door O
opened O
and O
about O
800 O
persons O
were O
pushed O
inside O
the O
chamber B-TER
, O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
separately O
. O

They O
were O
pushed O
inside O
with O
their O
hands O
up O
in O
the O
air O
, O
so O
that O
more O
would O
fit O
in O
. O

The O
murders B-TER
jabbed O
at O
the O
backs O
with O
bayonets O
, O
and O
after O
filling O
up O
the O
chamber B-TER
there O
was O
no O
space O
for O
even O
a O
pin O
. O

With O
a O
special O
machine O
, O
the O
air O
from O
the O
building O
was O
sucked O
out O
and O
the O
building O
was O
hermetically O
closed O
, O
and O
a O
car O
engine O
with O
gas B-TER
was O
started O
. O

The O
engine O
worked O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
. O

After O
10 O
minutes O
, O
a O
specially O
designated O
unit O
of O
Jews O
opened O
the O
chamber B-TER
, O
and O
a O
mass O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
appeared O
, O
their O
stood O
in O
the O
same O
position O
as O
when O
they O
were O
pushed O
inside O
. O

The O
Jewish O
unit O
removed O
the O
bodies B-TER
and O
carried O
them O
to O
the O
special O
pits B-TER
that O
were O
ready O
, O
as O
deep O
as O
a O
two O
- O
storey O
building O
and O
more O
, O
and O
there O
the O
bodies B-TER
were O
laid O
in O
layers O
one O
on O
the O
other O
. O

After O
every O
transport B-TER
, O
the O
layer O
was O
covered O
with O
sand O
, O
and O
when O
the O
pit B-TER
was O
full O
, O
chlorine O
was O
poured O
on O
and O
it O
was O
covered O
. O

After O
a O
certain O
time O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
, O
the O
burning B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
cadavers I-TER
started O
. O

Sort O
of O
grates O
from O
iron O
railings O
were O
constructed O
, O
wood O
was O
placed O
under O
them O
and O
the O
bodies B-TER
were I-TER
burned I-TER
. O

The O
content O
from O
the O
long O
- O
ago O
overfilled O
pits B-TER
was O
removed O
by O
special O
machines O
and O
placed O
next O
to O
the O
pits B-TER
. O

The O
specially O
designated O
Jews O
had O
to O
sift O
through O
the O
sand O
with O
their O
bare O
hands O
, O
collect O
all O
the O
flesh B-TER
and I-TER
bones I-TER
aside O
and O
carry O
it O
on O
stretchers O
in O
order O
to O
be O
burned B-TER
. O

A O
death O
punishment O
awaited O
those O
who O
would O
miss O
a O
smallest O
bone B-TER
in O
sand O
. O

The O
informant O
tells O
that O
he O
was O
a O
member O
of O
a O
worker O
unit O
that O
sorted O
through O
clothes B-TER
and O
did O
different O
other O
jobs O
. O

He O
spent O
11 O
months O
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
. O

The O
worker O
unit O
stayed O
alive O
for O
so O
long O
for O
a O
certain O
reason O
, O
that O
is O
, O
because O
one O
time O
, O
a O
transport B-TER
with O
Jews O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
arrived O
, O
a O
group O
of O
200 O
persons O
were O
selected O
and O
tortured O
horribly O
. O

A O
certain O
German B-TER
called O
Max B-PER
Biela I-PER
took O
a O
special O
part O
in O
this O
sadism O
. O

A O
Jew O
from O
the O
transport B-TER
ran O
to O
this O
German B-TER
and O
stuck O
a O
knife O
to O
his O
back O
, O
killing B-TER
him O
. O

As O
a O
punishment O
, O
around O
150 O
workers O
from O
the O
unit O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

The O
following O
day O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
Stangl B-PER
decided O
that O
in O
order O
not O
to O
repeat O
the O
experience O
of O
selecting O
new O
workers O
, O
the O
unit O
that O
was O
already O
working O
and O
comprised O
700 O
- O
1000 O
persons O
should O
for O
the O
time O
being O
stay O
for O
a O
longer O
period O
. O

In O
July O
1943 O
a O
group O
of O
workers O
started O
to O
organize O
an O
uprising B-TER
in O
order O
to O
destroy O
the O
death B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
to O
escape B-TER
afterwards O
. O

We O
stole O
guns O
and O
ammunition O
in O
sacks O
and O
hid O
it O
. O

While O
we O
were O
carrying O
the O
weapons O
, O
the O
workers O
were O
cleaning O
water O
basins O
pounding O
them O
violently O
on O
purpose O
in O
order O
to O
make O
a O
great O
noise O
– O
the O
Germans B-TER
moved O
further O
away O
from O
the O
barracks O
and O
we O
used O
the O
opportunity O
. O

On O
the O
2nd O
of O
August O
1943 O
, O
at O
4.15 O
PM O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
signal O
, O
a O
revolver O
shot O
, O
the O
uprising B-TER
broke O
out O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Jews O
set O
the O
petrol O
reserves O
on O
fire O
with O
grenades O
and O
then O
burned O
down O
the O
barracks O
and O
the O
fence O
. O

A O
considerable O
part O
of O
Ukrainians B-TER
defended O
themselves O
and O
because O
of O
that O
a O
few O
hundred O
insurgents O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

But O
a O
mass O
of O
Germans B-TER
and O
Ukrainians B-TER
also O
fell B-TER
. O

After O
burning O
down O
the O
barracks O
, O
we O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
. O

We O
were O
in O
Wilno B-LOC
when O
the O
Russo- O
German B-TER
war B-TER
broke O
out O
. O

Right O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
, O
because O
it O
was O
July O
12 O
, O
[ O
19]41 O
, O
I O
mysteriously O
lost O
my O
husband O
. O

He O
went O
out O
for O
a O
few O
cigarettes O
and O
he O
never O
returned O
. O

As O
I O
found O
out O
[ O
later O
] O
, O
he O
was O
caught O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
kidnapped B-TER
in O
a O
car O
. O

That O
same O
day O
, O
three O
thousand O
Jews O
were O
taken O
that O
way O
. O

I O
was O
left O
with O
my O
15 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
him O
and O
guarded O
him O
like O
my O
own O
life O
, O
and O
we O
managed O
to O
survive O
the O
many O
purges O
, O
and O
that O
was O
no O
mean O
feat O
, O
for O
when O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
existed O
for O
three O
months O
, O
only O
12,000 O
Jews O
were O
left O
of O
a O
total O
of O
75,000 O
. O

Fearing O
that O
the O
time O
would O
come O
for O
those O
who O
remain O
as O
well O
, O
we O
escaped B-TER
to O
Białystok B-LOC
. O

That O
is O
where O
the O
slaughter B-TER
began O
on O
February O
5 O
, O
[ O
19]43 O
. O

The O
first O
time O
, O
twelve O
thousand O
people O
were O
deported B-TER
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
, O
and O
1100 O
were O
killed B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

After O
a O
pause O
of O
a O
half O
- O
year O
, O
the O
total O
liquidation O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
began O
. O

That O
was O
August O
16 O
, O
1943 O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
with O
my O
siblings O
in O
an O
attic O
shelter B-TER
. O

At O
day O
break O
and O
evening O
[ O
? O
] O
, O
we O
crawled O
to O
the O
shelter B-TER
, O
cooking O
a O
meager O
meal B-TER
at O
night O
, O
our O
food B-TER
consisted O
of O
some O
groats O
and O
a O
few O
biscuits B-TER
without O
any O
fat O
at O
all O
. O

My B-TER
brother I-TER
and I-TER
his I-TER
wife I-TER
got O
out O
after O
4 O
weeks O
, O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
anywhere O
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
were O
worse O
and O
worse O
, O
the O
water O
was O
turned O
off O
, O
we O
could O
n’t O
cook O
and O
to O
make O
matters O
worse O
, O
we O
often O
witnessed O
the O
discovery O
of O
shelters B-TER
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
people O
who O
were O
discovered O
were O
killed B-TER
mercilessly O
, O
even O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
abused O
: O
Diese O
elenden O
hunde O
( O
German O
) O
– O
These O
pathetic O
dogs O
. O

and O
homeric O
laughter O
was O
their O
final O
farewell O
. O

We O
suffered O
like O
that O
for O
nine O
weeks O
. O

We O
felt O
that O
we O
would O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
out O
anymore O
. O

My O
son B-TER
decided O
to O
risk O
going O
out O
, O
since O
we O
were O
near O
the O
end O
anyway O
. O

One O
evening O
, O
he O
dug O
a O
hole O
under O
the O
exit O
gate O
and O
made O
it O
out O
successfully O
. O

He O
went O
to O
relatives B-TER
that O
were O
set O
up O
with O
some O
Poles B-TER
and O
my O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
managed O
to O
find O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
there O
after O
just O
fourteen O
days O
, O
however O
, O
because O
the O
child B-TER
told O
the O
neighbors O
about O
us O
. O

Wandering O
the O
streets O
, O
we O
approached O
a O
passerby O
, O
who O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
merciful O
person O
, O
took O
us O
under O
his O
wing O
and O
found O
us O
a O
good O
shelter B-TER
. O

We O
took O
it O
easy O
for O
three O
months O
. O

During O
that O
time O
, O
several O
Belarusians B-TER
were O
appointed O
to O
our O
apartment O
, O
and O
we O
were O
once O
again O
without O
a O
roof O
over O
our O
heads O
. O

My O
son B-TER
went O
to O
Mr. O
Czuliński B-PER
again O
, O
which O
is O
what O
our O
benefactor O
was O
called O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
to O
find O
us O
such O
a O
place O
again O
. O

And O
after O
a O
few O
days O
, O
he O
really O
did O
tell O
us O
that O
his O
former O
maid O
proposed O
a O
place O
with O
her O
. O

He O
and O
my O
son B-TER
went O
to O
agree O
on O
the O
conditions O
, O
and O
they O
never O
came O
back O
home O
. O

As O
we O
learned O
later O
, O
she O
was O
a O
cook O
for O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
was O
in O
their O
service O
. O

They O
were O
taken O
in O
handcuffs O
on O
January O
27 O
, O
1944 O
, O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
from O
there O
to O
prison B-TER
. O

Czuliński B-PER
was O
sent O
to O
a O
camp B-TER
, O
to O
Gdańsk B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
word O
that O
it O
had O
been O
the O
maid O
who O
delivered O
them O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
executioners B-TER
. O

My O
poor O
child B-TER
stayed O
in O
the O
death B-TER
cell I-TER
suffering O
and O
hungry B-TER
until O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
to O
Zielona B-LOC
, I-LOC
where O
the O
martyrs O
were O
killed B-TER
during O
that O
period O
. O

My O
relatives B-TER
took O
me O
under O
their O
care O
and O
convinced O
their O
protectors O
to O
keep O
and O
protect O
me O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
there O
when O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
arrived O
and O
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

It O
is O
only O
now O
that O
I O
feel O
the O
full O
brunt O
of O
my O
misfortune O
, O
all O
the O
delusions O
and O
hopes O
have O
burst O
. O

No O
one O
will O
return O
to O
us O
our O
dear O
ones O
who O
are O
dead B-TER
now O
, O
who O
were O
killed B-TER
in O
such O
a O
brutal O
fashion O

in O
1939 O
, O
I O
left O
for O
Kurów B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Puławy B-LOC

. O

After O
Kurów B-LOC
was O

, O
I O
moved O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Wólka B-LOC
Kątna I-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Markuszów B-LOC

, O
where O
I O
lived O
with O
my O

and O
four O
children B-TER
until O
April O
1942 O
. O

From O
there O
, O
we O
were O
resettled B-TER
in O
Opole B-LOC

Opole O
Lubelskie O
We O
settled O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
there O
, O
whose O
liquidation B-TER
began O
five O
weeks O
after O
we O
arrived O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
1942 O
, O
several O
transports B-TER
of O
Jews O
left O
Opole B-LOC
for O
an O
unknown O
destination O
, O
and O
we O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
again O
. O

In O
early O
May O
, O
Geda B-PER
, O
a O
clerk O
from O
the O
district O
office O
, O
came O
and O
ordered O
them O
to O
move O
to O
barracks B-TER
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
punishing B-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
for O
their O
filth O
and O
disorder O
. O

Then O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
surrounded O
those O
barracks B-TER
, O
guarded O
them O
for O
two O
days O
, O
and O
then O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
by O
cart B-TER
to O
the O
station O
in O
Nałęczów B-LOC
, O
while O
the O
men B-TER
were O
ordered O
to O
march O
there O
on O
foot O
. O

During O
the O
march O
, O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
asked O
the O
men O
, O
who O
wants O
to O
ride O
in O
the O
cart O
, O
and O
then O
they O
killed B-TER
anyone O
who O
volunteered O
. O

About O
50 O
people O
were O
killed B-TER
this O
way O
. O

People O
were O
also O
robbed B-TER
during O
the O
march O
. O

In O
Nałęczów B-LOC
, O
they O
kept O
everyone O
behind O
barbed O
wire O
for O
48 O
hours O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
if O
someone O
wanted O
to O
drink O
some O
of O
the O
water O
running O
from O
the O
drainpipe O
, O
he O
had O
to O
buy O
it O
with O
a O
ring O
, O
an O
earring O
, O
or O
an O
appropriate O
sum O
of O
money O
. O

Many O
people O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
and O
exhaustion O
then O
. O

When O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
getting O
off O
the O
carts O
, O
the O
SD B-ORG
-men O
guarding O
them O
beat O
those O
misfortunate O
people O
with O
riding O
crops O
until O
they O
bled O
. O

Then O
everyone O
was O
taken O
to O
Sobibór B-LOC
. O

Many O
people O
suffocated O
during O
the O
journey B-TER
because O
the O
wagons B-TER
were O
so O
overcrowded O
. O

The O
train B-TER
entered O
the O
camp B-TER
proper O
, O
which O
occupied O
an O
enormous O
area O
, O
and O
was O
surrounded O
by O
barbed O
wire O
four O
layers O
thick O
, O
and O
also O
by O
a O
deep O
ditch O
filled O
with O
water O
, O
and O
then O
even O
farther O
outside O
, O
the O
field O
adjacent O
to O
the O
ditch O
was O
mined O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
divided O
into O
three O
parts O
. O

The O
first O
and O
second O
were O
allowed O
to O
have O
contact O
with O
one O
another O
; O
the O
third O
was O
separate O
, O
located O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
it O
was O
forbidden O
to O
enter O
that O
area O
. O

Everyone O
who O
was O
in O
this O
camp B-TER
was O
liquidated B-TER
. O

As O
many O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
and O
children B-TER
as O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
could O
hold O
were O
herded O
into O
the O
third O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
unlucky O
were O
taken O
to O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

2 O
, O
where O
SS B-TER
read O
out O
the O
following O
statement O
: O
This O
is O
the O
transit O
camp O
, O
from O
here O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
Ukraine O
. O

They O
must O
go O
to O
the O
baths O
now O
, O
after O
which O
they O
will O
receive O
clean O
underwear O
and O
will O
continue O
on O
their O
way O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
were O
told O
to O
undress O
separately O
, O
but O
then O
the O
Germans B-TER
stopped O
trying O
to O
keep O
up O
appearances O
, O
and O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
undressed O
in O
the O
same O
room O
. O

In O
the O
next O
part O
of O
the O
speech O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
advised O
that O
each O
person O
should O
remember O
where O
he O
put O
his O
clothes B-TER
, O
so O
they O
would O
not O
get O
lost O
, O
and O
they O
advised O
people O
to O
put O
their O
money B-TER
and I-TER
valuables I-TER
in O
the O
deposit O
desk O
, O
for O
which O
they O
received O
a O
receipt O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
in O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

1 O
, O
those O
waiting O
were O
witness O
to O
a O
selection B-TER
, O
at O
which O
skilled O
workers O
without O
families B-TER
were O
sent O
off O
through O
the O
main O
gate O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Osowa B-LOC
and O
Sawin B-LOC
. O

300 O
skilled O
workers O
left O
this O
way O
, O
then O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
they O
were O
brought O
back O
and O
killed B-TER
. O

That O
group O
was O
forced O
to O
send O
letters O
to O
various O
towns O
so O
that O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
would O
not O
realize O
what O
danger O
they O
were O
in O
– O
after O
having O
carried O
out O
this O
task O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
Sobibór B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
perished O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-LOC
beat O
the O
people O
who O
were O
walking O
past O
, O
already O
naked O
, O
until O
they O
bled O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
2000 O
people O
in O
the O
Opole B-LOC
transport B-TER
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
100 O
people O
remained O
in O
the O
yard O
, O
and O
75 O
were O
sent O
to O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
to O
remove B-TER
the I-TER
corpses I-TER
. O

Up O
until O
that O
time O
, O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
it O
had O
usually O
been O
the O
case O
that O
those O
who O
had O
been O
working O
, O
regardless O
of O
what O
kind O
of O
work B-TER
it O
had O
been O
, O
would O
[ O
be O
killed O
] O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
fresh O
transport B-TER
came O
, O
and O
they O
would O
be O
replaced O
with O
people O
from O
the O
newly O
arrived O
group O
. O

Because O
of O
fears O
of O
rebellion B-TER
, O
people O
who O
were O
quite O
weak O
were O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
because O
of O
organizational O
difficulties O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
decided O
against O
constant O
changes O
and O
have O
permanent O
workers O
instead O
. O

This O
was O
how O
I O
was O
put O
to O
work O
as O
the O
permanent O
camp B-TER
cook O
; O
I O
took O
on O
my O
son B-TER
as O
an O
assistant O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
100 O
who O
arrived O
that O
first O
night O
gradually O
all O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
next O
transport B-TER
came O
from O
Żółkiew B-LOC
Probably O
Żółkiewka O
and O
Izbica B-LOC
. O

70 O
people O
from O
that O
transport B-TER
were O
designated O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
, O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. I-TER

The O
gate O
was O
permanently O
closed O
, O
and O
there O
were O
pine O
branches O
stuck O
in O
the O
barbed O

that O
surrounded O
[ O
the O

, O
completely O
obscuring O
it O
from O
view O

stuck O

The O

working O

3 O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
50 O
paces O
from O
the O

, O
and O
then O
walk O
away O
quickly O
. O

When O
transports B-TER
arrived O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TER
, O
since O
the O
food B-TER
that O
the O
Jews O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
was O
given O
to O
the O

As O
the O
cook B-TER

I O
lived O
with O
my O
son B-TER
in O
a O
separate O
building B-TER

In O

that O
kitchen B-TER

the O

the O
German B-TER

Several O
dozen O
people O
were O
chosen O
from O
each O

the O
following O
groups O
and O
a O
team B-TER
of I-TER
laborers I-TER
was O
formed O

which O
for O

for O

3 O
, O
the O
total O
was O
450 O

The O
conditions O
in O

were O
extremely B-TER
harsh I-TER
, O
with O
beatings O

dogs O
set O
on O
prisoners B-TER
, O
and O
50 O
lashes O
as O
punishment O
for O
badly O
done O
work B-TER

The O
Jews O
were O
changed O
there O
very O
often O
, O
and O
, O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
other O
camps B-TER
, O
the O
weak O
were O
taken O
to O
the O

Every O

2 O

went O

so O
they O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

Within O
4 O

5 O
weeks O
everything O
was O
organized O

In O
camps B-TER

1 O
and O
2 O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
put O
to O
work B-TER
sorting I-TER
and I-TER
packing I-TER
the O
belongings O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
killed B-TER

In O
addition O
, O
the O
skilled B-TER
workers I-TER
were O
always O
kept O
busy O
doing O
various O
jobs O
. O

They O
sang O
as O
they O
went O
to O
work B-TER
( O
those O
were O
the O
orders O
) O
, O
and O
if O
the O
work B-TER
was O
not O
done O
, O
people O
were O
beaten O
, O
or O
a O
dog O
was O
let O
loose O
on O
them O

As O
people O
worked O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
amused O
themselves O
by O
beating O
the O
people O
who O
were O
working B-TER
until O
they O
bled O
, O
and O
when O
the O
blood O
was O
flowing O
, O
they O
poured O
vinegar O
on O
the O
wounds O
and O
kept O
beating O
them O
. O

Jewish O
foremen O
headed O
the O
groups O
of O
workers B-TER

One O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
in O
particular O
named O
Paul B-PER
was O
especially O
sadistic O
, O
and O
would O
often O
make O
the O
misfortunate O
one O
he O
chose O
drink O
Franc O

Brantwein O

Frantzbrenntwein O
( O
German O

rubbing O
alcohol O

after O
which O
the O
person O
was O
sick B-TER
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
and O
often O
died B-TER
with O
symptoms O
of O
having O
been O
poisoned O
. O

Jews O
were O
brought O
at O
that O
time O
from O
Austria B-LOC

the O
Czech B-LOC
lands I-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC

Holland B-LOC

and O
France B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
were O
annihilated O
. O

When O
no O
transports B-TER
arrived O
and O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
food B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
would O
beat O
people O
brutally O
when O
workers B-TER
would O
find O
pieces O
of O
moldy O
bread B-TER
in O
the O
packages O
and O
eat O
it O
. O

Three O
months O
after O
we O
arrived O
, O
the O
killing B-TER
stopped O
, O
the O
officers O
were O
granted O
leaves O
for O
their O
ardent O
activities O
, O
and O
the O
oven O
began O
to O
be O
disassembled O
. O

Two O
months O
later O
, O
10 O
masons O
were O
brought O
in O
, O
Warsaw B-LOC
Jews O
from O
Treblinka B-LOC

2 O
wagons O
of O
food B-TER
and O
bread B-TER
, O
and O
bricks O
, O
and O
construction O
of O
a O
new O
oven O
began O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
said O
at O
that O
time O
that O
this O
oven O
would O
be O
for O
the O
Poles B-LOC
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
making O
use O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
workers B-TER
from O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
were O
assigned O
some O
work B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
I O
found O
out O
about O
the O
sad O
reality O
at O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
. O

The O
conversation O
took O
place O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
despite O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
guard O
. O

It O
was O
then O
I O
found O
out O
that O
after O
having O
been O
gassed B-TER
, O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
buried O
30,000 O
to O
40,000 O
to O
a O
pit O
. O

The O
corpses B-TER
were O
doused O
in O
chlorine O
, O
and O
then O
later O
buried O
. O

When O
the O
pit O
was O
full O
, O
it O
was O
covered O
with O
dirt O
. O

It O
stank O
very O
badly O
despite O
the O
chlorine O
. O

After O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
when O
the O
workers B-TER
asked O
where O
their O
families B-TER
were O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
said O
that O
they O
are O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
some O
of O
them O
even O
have O
their O
own O
farms O
as O
independent O
farmers O
, O
and O
that O
they O
would O
see O
them O
in O
two O
weeks O
. O

Sometimes O
a O
clerk O
from O
the O
Arbeitsamt O
in O
Włodawa B-LOC
, O
who O
used O
to O
order O
clothing B-TER
for O
himself O
from O
the O
[ O
dead O
] O
Jews O
’ O
things O
, O
would O
tell O
another O
little O
fairy O
tale O
: O
that O
the O
Jews O
from O
this O
camp B-TER
would O
be O
sent O
to O
Kraków B-LOC
. O

In O
September O
, O
the O
new O
gassing B-TER
equipment O
was O
finished O
. O

It O
had O
8 O
compartments O
that O
could O
each O
hold O
100 O
- O
120 O
people O
. O

This O
way O
, O
1000 O
people O
could O
be O
killed B-TER
at O
one O
time O
. O

After O
this O
factory O
was O
ready O
, O
fresh O
transports B-TER
began O
to O
arrive O
. O

Once O
, O
when O
a O
20 O
- O
wagon O
transport B-TER
arrived O
with O
people O
from O
Biała B-LOC
Podlaska I-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
decided O
to O
send O
the O
clothes B-TER
, O
underwear B-TER
, O
and O
other O
such O
things O
by O
that O
train B-TER
. O

The O
occupants O
of O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
were O
put O
to O
work O
, O
and O
they O
were O
given O
an O
additional O
200 O
Jews O
from O
the O
new O
transport B-TER
for O
help O
. O

The O
work B-TER
lasted O
from O
3:30 O
a.m. O
until O
eight O
p.m. O
The O
workers B-TER
were O
rushed O
during O
that O
very O
hot O
day O
. O

The O
old O
inmates B-TER
were O
given O
hats O
in O
order O
to O
distinguish O
them O
from O
the O
new O
people O
. O

When O
one O
old O
man B-TER
from O
the O
newly O
arrived O
group O
fainted O
while O
working B-TER
, O
his O
son B-TER
, O
who O
was O
walking O
behind O
him O
, O
was O
ordered O
to O
hang B-TER
him O
from O
the O
first O
tree O
. O

One O
worker B-TER
managed O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
this O
clothing B-TER
transport B-TER
and O
was O
later O
able O
to O
escape B-TER
successfully O
. O

On O
Christmas O
Eve O
1942 O
, O
3 O
Jewish O
men B-TER
, O
2 O
Jewish O
women B-TER
, O
and O
2 O
Ukrainians B-LOC
managed O
to O
escape B-TER

The O
next O
evening O
, O
the O
workers B-TER
from O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
were O
assembled O
and O
an O
evening O
of O
musical B-TER
entertainment I-TER
was O
organized O
, O
with O
dancing O
and O
singing O
( O
loud O
) O
, O
while O
in O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
about O
300 O
Jews O
( O
permanent B-TER
workers I-TER
) O
were O
shot B-TER
in O
retaliation O
for O
the O
escape B-TER
. O

In O
October O
1942 O
, O
a O
crane O
was O
brought O
in O
, O
and O
they O
began O
to O
take O
corpses B-TER
out O
of O
the O
ground O
and O
burn O
them O
. O

In O
winter O
there O
were O
fewer O
transports B-TER
, O
and O
people O
were O
transported B-TER
barefoot O
. O

The O
children B-TER
in O
the O
trains B-TER
were O
so O
thirsty O
that O
they O
would O
eat O
snow O
. O

In O
the O
spring O
of O
1943 O
, O
trains B-TER
began O
arriving O
with O
Jews O
from O
abroad O
. O

In O
July O
1943 O
, O
20 O
workers B-TER
went O
outside O
the O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
to O
cut O
down O
trees O
. O

They O
were O
supposed O
to O
construct O
places O
to O
store O
and O
sort O
the O
ammunition O
that O
had O
been O
obtained O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
got O
this O
idea O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
was O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
devise O
a O
new O
way O
of O
avoiding O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
front O
. O

While O
at O
work O
, O
the O
heat O
was O
bothering O
them O
terribly O
, O
and O
one O
time O
when O
two O
of O
them O
went O
with O
a O
Ukrainian B-LOC
to O
get O
some O
water O
, O
they O
liquidated O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
, O
took O
his O
weapon O
and O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
to O
the O
forest O
. O

The O
officer O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
guard O
, O
having O
figured O
out O
what O
had O
happened O
after O
they O
had O
been O
gone O
a O
long O
time O
, O
surrounded O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
and O
began O
returning O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Eight O
more O
took O
advantage O
of O
that O
moment O
and O
escaped B-TER
. O

The O
[ O
remaining O
] O
10 O
Jews O
were O
brought O
back O
to O
camp B-TER
with O
their O
hands O
on O
their O
necks O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
worker O
of O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
were O
summoned O
and O
, O
after O
a O
speech O
justifying O
the O
necessity O
of O
carrying O
out O
the O
death B-TER
sentence I-TER
, O
the O
10 O
unlucky O
men O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
said O
that O
if O
anything O
like O
that O
ever O
happened O
again O
, O
they O
would O
kill B-TER
half O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
's O
workers B-TER
. O

Ten O
more O
were O
shot B-TER
in O
retaliation O
for O
the O
escape B-TER
one O
night O
of O
two O
other O
Jews O
. O

The O
workers B-TER
had O
to O
stand O
guard O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
as O
punishment O
, O
and O
the O
windows O
were O
closed O
and O
barbed O
wire O
was O
put O
on O
them O
. O

Jews O
had O
been O
harboring O
thoughts O
of O
revolt B-TER
and O
escape B-TER
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

After O
long O
meetings O
of O
those O
privy O
to O
the O
conspiracy B-TER
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
an O
uprising B-TER
would O
be O
staged O
in O
mid- O
October O
, O
when O
some O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
would O
be O
on O
furlough O
. O

One O
day O
, O
according O
to O
a O
prearranged O
plan O
, O
between O
4 O
and O
5 O
p.m. O
, O
they O
began O
to O
liquidate O
certain O
officers O
in O
closed O
sheds O
and O
barracks B-TER
. O

They O
had O
been O
lured O
to O
those O
places O
under O
various O
pretexts O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
's I-TER
second O
in O
command O
was O
the O
first O
to O
be O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
plan O
was O
carried O
out O
scrupulously O
, O
and O
when O
all O
the O
workers B-TER
assembled O
for O
the O
evening O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
at O
5 O
p.m. O
, O
the O
leaders O
announced O
that O
the O
revolt B-TER
had O
begun O
. O

They O
had O
just O
obtained O
their O
weapons O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Ukrainian B-LOC
guards O
shot B-TER
a O
thick O
barrage O
of O
gunfire O
. O

The O
Jews O
rushed O
at O
the O
barbed O
wire O
with O
axes O
and O
pliers O
, O
and O
wood O
and O
boards O
were O
thrown O
onto O
the O
minefield O
so O
the O
mines O
would O
explode O
. O

After O
a O
short O
and O
intense O
battle O
, O
during O
which O
180 O
people O
died B-TER
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

Fifty O
ill B-TER
people O
stayed O
in O
the O
camp B-TER

and O
400 O
people O
escaped B-TER

The O
telephone O
and O
electrical O
lines O
had O
been O
cut O
beforehand O

In O
the O

people O
split O
up O
into O
small O

went O
off O
in O

willing O
to O
have O
Jews O
in O
the O
marketplace O
, O
incited O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
Jews O
were B-TER
forbidden I-TER
to I-TER
trade I-TER
in I-TER
the I-TER
marketplace I-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
German B-TER
police B-TER
ordered B-TER
that I-TER
Jews I-TER
had I-TER
to I-TER
give I-TER
away I-TER
gold I-TER
and I-TER
furs I-TER
. O

After O
a O
certain O
time O
, O
Jews O
were O
moved O
into O
the O
following O
streets O
: O
Vilner B-LOC
, O
a O
half O
of O
Drujer B-LOC
, O
Kishleker B-LOC
, O
Dobrove B-LOC
, O
and O
told O
that O
Jews O
only O
had O
right O
to O
move O
in O
the O
territory O
of O
these O
streets O
. O

They O
carried O
white O
bands B-TER
on O
their O
arms O
, O
but O
the O
life O
was O
not O
so O
bad O
, O
the O
trade O
did O
not O
stop O
. O

A O
Judenrat B-TER
was O
created O
. O

Lederman B-PER
, O
a O
former O
fabric O
dealer O
, O
was O
appointed O
as O
the O
chairman B-TER
. O

The O
militia O
consisted O
of O
former O
traders O
: O
Ike B-PER
Libe I-PER
- I-PER
Toybes I-PER
, O
Yude B-PER
Blant I-PER
, O
Khaym B-PER
- I-PER
Ber I-PER
Gordon I-PER
, O
Ayzik B-PER
Vaynshteyn I-PER
and O
others O
. O

All O
Jews O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
chairman B-TER
Lederman B-PER
would O
speak O
to O
people O
and O
warn O
them O
to O
be O
obedient O
, O
not O
to O
go O
to O
forbidden B-TER
areas I-TER
and O
not O
to O
try O
to O
avoid O
work B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
demanded O
money O
and O
gold O
and O
Jews O
were O
not O
in O
hurry O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
, O
the O
chairman B-TER
with O
the O
militia O
went O
to O
look O
for O
it O
in O
people O
’s O
homes O
. O

The O
police B-TER
would O
force O
the O
people O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

If O
one O
of O
them O
was O
angry O
at O
someone O
, O
he O
would O
give O
that O
person O
in O
SS B-ORG
hands O
and O
the O
person O
would O
not O
come O
back O
. O

Once O
the O
policemen B-TER
came O
to O
the O
chairman B-TER
and O
explained O
that O
there O
were O
too O
many O
Jews O
, O
some O
of O
them O
had O
to O
be O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
chairman B-TER
pleaded O
that O
there O
were O
young O
people O
, O
good O
workers O
, O
who O
were O
useful O
to O
the O
authorities O
and O
they O
would O
continue O
to O
be O
very O
useful O
. O

And O
they O
answered O
that O
if O
there O
were O
strong O
ones O
and O
weak O
ones O
, O
two O
ghettos B-TER
would O
be O
established O
, O
one O
for O
the O
young O
who O
would O
work B-TER
and O
one O
for O
the O
old O
and O
weak O
who O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
in O
stages O
. O

The O
second O
ghetto B-TER
was O
in O
Kisholeyk B-LOC
street I-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish O
police B-TER
menaced O
every O
Jew O
with O
moving O
them O
to O
the O
second O
ghetto B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
demanded B-TER
gold I-TER
, I-TER
a I-TER
contribution I-TER
, O
and O
a O
Jew O
could O
not O
pay O
this O
tax B-TER
, O
they O
would O
send O
him O
to O
the O
second O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Around O
a O
thousand O
people O
lived O
in O
the O
second O
ghetto B-TER
, O
the O
old O
and O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
between O
twenty O
and O
thirty O
families B-TER
that O
did O
not O
have O
any O
gold B-TER
to I-TER
give I-TER
away I-TER
. O

Two O
days O
later O
the O
SS B-ORG
came O
to O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
and O
demanded O
700 O
persons O
to O
shoot B-TER
. O

As O
the O
second O
ghetto B-TER
had O
been O
established O
, O
the O
chairman B-TER
told O
them O
to O
go O
to O
Kisholeyk B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
, O
the O
police B-TER
surrounded O
Kisholeykes B-LOC
and O
took O
people O
out O
of O
their O
homes O
. O

A O
part O
of O
them O
hid B-TER
themselves O
and O
stayed O
inside O
, O
because O
the O
police B-TER
did O
not O
search O
too O
diligently O
. O

On O
the O
following O
day O
at O
dawn O
I O
saw O
the O
people O
from O
Kisholeyki B-LOC
marching O
one O
next O
to O
the O
other O
, O
with O
a O
hand O
on O
the O
other O
’s O
shoulder O
. O

They O
were O
led O
to O
the O
forest O
called O
Borok O
and O
shot B-TER
there O
. O

Two O
months O
later O
, O
the O
police B-TER
ordered O
all O
the O
Jews O
to O
assembly O
in O
one O
square O
( O
the O
horse O
market O
) O
and O
started O
to O
verify O
the O
work B-TER
cards O
. O

On O
some O
of O
them O
, O
they O
wrote O
master O
[ O
? O
] O
and O
from O
that O
we O
immediately O
understood O
that O
those O
who O
had O
such O
cards O
would O
live O
. O

The O
remaining O
ones O
received O
cards O
with O
coded O
names O
: O
Orsha B-LOC
, O
Borisov B-LOC
, O
Smolensk B-LOC
. O

Those O
with O
the O
master O
[ O
? O
] O
card O
immediately O
returned O
home O
. O

The O
remaining O
ones O
figured O
out O
that O
Borisov B-LOC
meant O
Borok B-LOC
. O

This O
is O
the O
forest O
where O
the O
killings B-TER
take O
place O
. O

Indeed O
, O
after O
a O
few O
hours O
these O
people O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
Borok B-LOC
forest O
and O
shot B-TER
by O
the O
Polish B-TER
police B-TER
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
every O
evening O
, O
during O
the O
return O
from O
work B-TER
, O
Germans B-TER
would O
grab O
one O
Jew O
and O
shoot B-TER
him O
. O

After O
half O
a O
year O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
’s O
existence O
, O
when O
the O
partisans B-TER
attacked O
the O
neighbouring O
towns O
Dokshitsy B-LOC
and O
Krulevshtshina B-LOC
, O
with O
which O
lots O
of O
Germans B-TER
Sentence O
unclear O
in O
the O
original O
, O
some O
words O
must O
be O
missing O
. O

, O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
Glubokoye B-LOC
became O
fearful O
the O
same O
would O
not O
happen O
in O
Glubokoye B-LOC
, O
and O
their O
order O
the O
vice B-TER
- I-TER
chairman I-TER
of O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
, O
Yudl B-PER
Blond I-PER
, O
to O
assemble O
all O
the O
Jews O
in O
order O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
it O
suddenly O
became O
very O
silent O
, O
no O
one O
showed O
up O
in O
the O
street O
. O

After O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
concerted O
, O
a O
few O
women B-TER
with O
small O
bundles O
appeared O
in O
the O
street O
; O
as O
the O
men B-TER
were O
still O
nowhere O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
opened O
fire O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
ghetto B-TER
. O

No O
one O
answered O
them O
any O
shots O
, O
so O
they O
entered O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Just O
as O
they O
appeared O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
streets O
, O
heavy O
fire O
met O
them O
. O

Grenades O
were O
thrown O
at O
them O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
fell B-TER
from O
the O
first O
shots O
. O

I O
saw O
three O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
lying O
dead B-TER
. O

But O
the O
police B-TER
started O
to O
shoot O
at O
every O
house O
and O
threw O
a O
grenade O
in O
every O
window O
. O

The O
Jews O
realized O
that O
the O
situation O
was O
hopeless O
, O
so O
everyone O
took O
their O
bottle O
of O
petrol O
and O
set O
the O
house O
, O
where O
they O
were O
, O
on O
fire O
. O

In O
the O
smoke O
and O
fire O
, O
people O
ran O
where O
they O
could O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
also O
set O
houses O
on O
fire O
. O

The O
fire O
flames O
illuminated O
the O
whole O
town O
. O

When O
the O
shooting O
started O
, O
my O
mother B-TER
went O
out O
into O
the O
street O
to O
look O
what O
was O
happening O
and O
was O
hit O
with O
a O
bullet O
in O
the O
neck O
. O

I O
, O
my O
father B-TER
, O
sister B-TER
and O
brother B-TER
went O
out O
, O
moved O
the O
mother B-TER
away O
from O
the O
street O
and O
went O
up O
to O
the O
attic O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
suffocating O
smoke O
, O
my O
father B-TER
went O
down O
. O

The O
mother B-TER
could O
not O
walk O
and O
fell O
down O
from O
the O
attic O
. O

I O
went O
down O
, O
helped O
the O
mother B-TER
to O
her O
feet O
and O
started O
to O
run O
to O
my O
father B-TER
and O
brother B-TER
. O

From O
below O
, O
I O
heard O
shouting O
: O
– O
Halt O
! O
I O
looked O
around O
and O
did O
not O
see O
my O
father B-TER
. O

We O
lied O
down O
on O
our O
bellies O
. O

A O
German B-TER
approached O
and O
shot O
at O
my O
mother B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
him O
loading O
his O
gun O
, O
so O
I O
stood O
up O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

After O
a O
second O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
hide B-TER
myself O
under O
a O
brick O
house O
. O

It O
was O
the O
evening O
already O
, O
the O
smoke O
was O
irritating O
the O
eyes O
, O
I O
could O
not O
see O
where O
I O
was O
going O
. O

Wandering O
around O
the O
ghetto B-TER
like O
that O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
someone O
was O
following O
me O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
pronounce O
my O
brother B-TER
’s O
name O
. O

Indeed O
, O
he O
answered O
. O

Then O
we O
both O
walked O
through O
the O
ruins O
. O

People O
were O
running O
, O
we O
followed O
them O
. O

The O
machine O
guns O
were O
still O
shooting O
. O

During O
a O
short O
distance O
we O
had O
to O
fall O
on O
our O
bellies O
a O
few O
times O
. O

When O
the O
ghetto B-TER
fence O
had O
burned O
down O
, O
I O
and O
my O
brother B-TER
left O
the O
ghetto B-TER
territory O
. O

We O
entered O
a O
garden O
and O
slept O
there O
until O
the O
dawn O
. O

When O
the O
day O
came O
, O
my O
brother B-TER
told O
me O
to O
go O
have O
a O
look O
where O
the O
Germans B-TER
where O
. O

I O
left O
the O
garden O
. O

Two O
Germans B-TER
were O
standing O
looking O
at O
the O
other O
direction O
. O

I O
could O
not O
go O
back O
, O
so O
I O
went O
through O
the O
fields O
and O
the O
forests O
to O
the O
villages O
and O
asked O
, O
where O
the O
partisans B-TER
where O
. O

During O
the O
fire O
, O
the O
father B-TER
told O
us O
that O
if O
someone O
from O
us O
stayed O
alive O
, O
they O
should O
go O
the O
village O
called O
Arebova B-LOC
Orekhovno O
, O
5 O
kilometers O
from O
Glubokoye B-LOC
. O

I O
spent O
a O
whole O
day O
wandering O
in O
the O
woods O
until O
I O
came O
to O
that O
village O
. O

I O
called O
my O
father B-TER
by O
name O
, O
but O
no O
one O
answered O
. O

However O
, O
peasants O
that O
knew O
my O
father B-TER
and O
heard O
me O
shouting O
, O
warned O
me O
I O
should O
quickly O
go O
away O
because O
the O
village O
elder O
was O
coming O
. O

I O
ran O
fast O
down O
the O
hill O
and O
entered O
a O
forest O
. O

Walking O
, O
a O
heard O
a O
pig O
squeak O
. O

Following O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
squeaks O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
on O
a O
path O
, O
where O
I O
met O
peasants O
from O
Glubokoye B-LOC
I O
knew O
; O
I O
followed O
their O
horse O
cart O
. O

I O
saw O
Germans B-TER
on O
the O
road O
, O
so O
I O
quickly O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
and O
entered O
a O
cemetery B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
that O
they O
were O
following O
me O
and O
they O
caught O
me O
. O

They O
asked O
me O
who O
I O
was O
. O

I O
answered O
that O
I O
was O
a O
Christian B-TER
girl B-TER
. O

They O
laughed O
and O
told O
me O
not O
to O
be O
afraid O
, O
that O
they O
knew O
I O
was O
a O
Jewish O
girl B-TER
. O

They O
asked O
me O
where O
I O
was O
going O
. O

– O
I O
’m O
following O
my O
nose O
, O
I O
answered O
. O

– O
Tell O
me O
, O
do O
you O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
partisans B-TER
? O
– O
one O
of O
them O
asked O
again O
. O

– O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
where O
to O

– O
I O
answered O
. O

– O

house O
, O

’ll O
be O
able O
to O
sleep O
there O
– O
one O
of O
them O
said O
and O
pointed O
where O
to O
go O
. O

I O
entered O
the O
house O
and O
asked O
for O
something O
to O
drink B-TER
. O

I O
received O
it O
. O

The O
owner O
of O
the O
house O
questioned O
me O
who O
I O
was O
, O
I O
answered O
that O
I O
was O
form O
Glubokoye B-LOC
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
sleep O
at O
his O
place O
. O

He O
told O
me O
to O
go O
away O
immediately O
. O

Leaving O
a O
house O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
ploughing O
. O

I O
approached O
him O
and O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
sleep O
at O
his O
place O
. O

He O
answered O
no O
, O
but O
called O
me O
back O
and O
gave O
me O
instructions O
to O
enter O
a O
barn O
where O
I O
could O
sleep O
. O

He O
brought O
me O
food B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Then O
he O
came O
back O
again O
soon O
and O
told O
me O
: O
– O
Two O
Jews O
have O
just O
passed O
by O
, O
run O
quickly O
! O
I O
ran O
and O
shouted O
to O
the O
Jews O
to O
wait O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
stop O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
run O
and O
caught O
up O
with O
them O
. O

They O
were O
people O
from O
Glubokoye B-LOC
I O
knew O
, O
a O
married B-TER
couple O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
partisan B-TER
area O
with O
them O
. O

They O
left O
me O
in O
a O
Christian B-TER
woman B-TER
’s O
house O
and O
left O
. O

I O
asked O
how O
to O
reach O
the O
partisan B-TER
units O
. O

I O
was O
not O
accepted O
into O
three O
units O
. O

Young O
guys B-TER
sat O
with O
guns O
. O

They O
questioned O
me O
who O
I O
was O
, O
from O
where O
I O
came O
and O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
another O
village O
1,5 O
kilometer O
away O
from O
that O
village O
. O

Going O
there O
I O
asked O
a O
peasant O
woman B-TER
where O
the O
commander O
was O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
a O
man B-TER
was O
passing O
by O
on O
a O
bicycle O
and O
the O
woman B-TER
told O
me O
to O
ask O
him O
. O

I O
stopped O
him O
, O
showed O
him O
the O
note O
from O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
previous O
village O
which O
said O
we O
should O
contact O
the O
regional O
commander O
. O

He O
immediately O
led O
me O
to O
a O
house O
in O
the O
village O
. O

I O
waited O
in O
the O
street O
. O

He O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
5th O
unit O
, O
from O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
Konstantinov B-PER
Vania I-PER
. O

I O
met O
Jews O

. O

The O
commander O
asked O
them O
if O
they O
knew O
me O
, O
they O
answered O
negatively O
, O
but O
I O
knew O
them O
. O

I O
entered O
the O
house O
. O

After O
having O
a O
rest O
, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
kitchen O
and O
helped O

After O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
shooting O
the O
Russian B-TER
prisoners B-TER
, O
Konstantinov B-PER
and O
Rodionov B-PER
proposed O
the O
Germans B-TER
to O
create O
a O
brigade O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
partisans B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
gave O
them O
a O
permission O
, O
and O
they O
organized O
quite O
a O
large O
group O
, O
armed O
with O
shotguns O
and O
machine O
guns O
. O

Konstantinov B-PER
and O
Rodionov B-PER
went O
over O
to O
the O
partisans B-TER
and O
created O
the O
nine O
units O
. O

I O
was O
5 O
kilometers O

I O
was O
told O

People O
ran O
away O

lots O
of O
Germans B-TER

Just O
as O
they O
had O
crossed O
the O

, O
the O
Germans B-TER
surrounded O
them O

We O

We O
waited O
the O
Germans B-TER
to O
come O
looking O

us O
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
come O

I O
learned O

that O

Our O

400 O
more O

The O

The O
Jews O

were O
too O

It O

Apart O

During O
the O

, O
some O
of O
the O

On O

In O
the O
square O
of O
Wieliczka B-LOC
, O
[ O
we O

had O
to O
stand O
in O
groups O
of O
a O
hundred O
people O
, O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

[ O
We O
] O
stood O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
under O
the O
burning O
sun O
and O
then O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
told O
to O
sit O
on O
the O

. O

[ O
We O
were O
] O
guarded O
by O
a O

After O

300 O
more O
were O
chosen O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Płaszów B-LOC
- O
Krakow B-LOC
cable O
factory B-TER
. O

Then O
the O
women B-TER
and O
the O
children B-TER
were O
driven O
, O
murderously O
beaten O
and O
driven O
into O
railway O
carriages O
, O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Belzec B-LOC
. O

The O
sight O
[ O
was O
] O
a O
horrible O
one O
. O

Wails O
, O
crying O
and O
shouting O
of O
around O
600 O
people O
was O
so O
frightful O
, O
that O
it O
was O
heard O
from O
a O
distance O
of O
a O
few O
kilometers O
. O

The O
backpacks O
[ O
… O
] O
When O
everyone O
was O
already O
standing O
, O
the O
Sturmmann B-TER
took O
out O
his O
revolver O
and O
started O
to O
shoot O
at O
the O
crowd O
– O
supposedly O
at O
the O
sick B-TER
– O
but O
in O
reality O
[ O
he O
] O
shot B-TER
more O
healthy O
than O
sick B-TER
men B-TER
. O

The O
wounded O
ones O
were O
wrangling O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
pain O
and O
agony O
– O
the O
Sturmmann B-TER
stood O
and O
looked O
at O
them O
with O
a O
sarcastic O
and O
sadistic O
joy O
and O
had O
pleasure O
. O

Most O
of O
[ O
people O
] O
asked O
him O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
so O
much O
awful O
pain O
. O

[ O
He O
] O
noticed O
that O
I O
looked O
very O
frightened O
, O
[ O
so O
he O
] O
ordered O
me O
to O
occupy O
myself O
with O
carrying O
away O
the O
wounded O
. O

Blood O
was O
dripping O
from O
their O
faces O
, O
[ O
so O
he O
] O
ordered O
me O
to O
cover O
the O
blood O
streams O
with O
sand O
. O

They O
were O
buried B-TER
alive I-TER
. O

The O
ground O
was O
rising O
from O
the O
people O
buried B-TER
alive I-TER
. O

Often O
[ O
there O
was O
] O
an O
upper O
layer O
of O
blood O
that O
had O
seeped O
through O
from O
the O
buried B-TER
ones O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
hard O
labour B-TER
, O
we O
prayed O
every O
morning O
we O
would O
be O
brought O
to O
work B-TER
in O
order O
not O
to O
see O
the O
sad O
scenes O
. O

[ O
When O
we O
would O
] O
go O
out O
through O
the O
gate O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
Jewish O
order O
service O
, O
Dr O
Libeskin B-PER
from O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
would O
stand O
and O
count O
[ O
us O
] O
and O
wished O
us O
in O
Polish O
: O
Wracajcie O
, O
chłopcy O
. O

He O
would O
not O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
beaten O
, O
pushed O
, O
shoved O
, O
told O
to O
run O
, O
shot O
at O
etc O
. O

If O
someone O
fell O
or O
became O
a O
little O
tired O
– O
he O
was O
shot B-TER
immediately O
. O

There O
were O
victims B-TER
every O
day O
. O

When O
[ O
we O
] O
came O
to O
the O
place O
of O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
were O
were O
] O
counted O
again O
. O

Because O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
[ O
were O
] O
poor O
mathematicians O
, O
the O
numbers O
never O
matched O
for O
them O
. O

Sometimes O
too O
few O
, O
sometimes O
too O
many O
. O

The O
counting O
would O
take O
hours O
. O

During O
it O
[ O
they O
] O
beat O
us O
savagely O
. O

There O
was O
a O
Polish B-TER
overseer B-TER
at O
work O
, O
registered O
as O
a O
Volksdeutsch O
, O
he O
took O
revenge O
on O
us O
, O
cursed O
us O
, O
hit O
, O
swore O
, O
robbed O
us O
of O
our O
belongings O
etc O
. O

He O
would O
force O
the O
Jews O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
push O
a O
railway O
car O
of O
30 O
tons O
. O

Żydzie O
, O
what O
are O
these O
shoes O
good O
for O
you O
, O
you O
will O
be O
shot O
in O
any O
case O
! O
! O
! O
We O
worked B-TER
at O
least O
10 O
- O
12 O
hours O
. O

Together O
with O
the O
counting O
and O
the O
walking O
to O
work B-TER
and O
back O
for O
8 O
kilometers O
, O
a O
working B-TER
day O
was O
about O
18 O
hours O
long O
. O

12 O
o’clock O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
lunch B-TER
hour O
. O

We O
, O
the O
Jewish O
pigs O
, O
were O
brought O
some O
water O
with O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
bread B-TER
that O
we O
had O
to O
drink O
standing O
. O

[ O
We O
would O
] O
often O
run O
to O
the O
free O
Polish B-TER
workers O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
who O
received O
good O
food B-TER
and O
lived O
as O
free O
people O
in O
relatively O
good O
conditions B-TER
, O
and O
asked O
them O
for O
food B-TER
scraps I-TER
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
or O
could O
not O
eat B-TER
, O
for O
example O
, O
stale O
pieces O
of O
bread B-TER
etc O
. O

But O
the O
Poles B-TER
would O
rather O
throw O
it O
to O
the O
rubbish O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
it O
to O
the O
poor O
Jews O
. O

The O
cooks O
did O
the O
same O
with O
the O
leftovers O
and O
food B-TER
scraped I-TER
from O
the O
cauldrons O
. O

As O
we O
were O
returning O
from O
the O
bath O
in O
Rozwadów B-LOC
, O
the O
Hauptmann O
told O
to O
one O
of O
us O
: O
Oh O
, O
dreckige O
Jude O
, O
you O
still O
have O
shitty O
eyes O
, O
and O
shot B-TER
him O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
. O

Once O
when O
we O
were O
being O
marched O
to O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
they O
] O
had O
an O
idea O
that O
we O
should O
not O
run O
, O
but O
go O
slowly O
, O
and O
[ O
they O
] O
told O
us O
to O
sing O
. O

Nobody O
sang O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
started O
to O
beat O
us O
and O
shoot O
at O
us O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
started O
to O
sing O
. O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
singing O
was O
! O
More O
like O
wailing O
than O
singing O
. O

Polish B-TER
women B-TER
that O
were O
passing O
by O
shouted O
: O
Zobaczcie O
jak O
dobrze O
się O
powodzi O
tym O
Żydkom O
– O
s[kurwy]syny O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-TER
spoke O
Russian B-TER
as O
a O
provocation O
, O
told O
that O
they O
were O
from O
Leningrad B-LOC
etc O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
started O
to O
allow O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
during O
the O
night O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
cold B-TER
we O
had O
to O
go O
twenty O
times O
a O
night O
. O

But O
no O
one O
came O
back O
. O

They O
were O
shot B-TER
going O
there O
or O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
Jews O

! O
( O
He O
wrote O
a O
postcard O
that O
cost O
6 O
groszy O
to O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
and O
received O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
. O

) O
That O
’s O
how O
Schwammberger B-PER
boasted O
loudly O
. O

Schwammberger B-PER
personally O
shot B-TER
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
, O
the O
rabbi B-TER
of O
Wieliczka B-LOC
, O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
closing O
prayer B-TER
, O
in O
1942 O
. O

Before O
shooting B-TER
[ O
him O
] O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
held O
the O
following O
speech O
to O
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
: O
Herr O
Oberrabiner O
! O
I O
decided O
to O
shoot O
you O
for O
sabotage O
! O
The O
sabotage B-TER
was O
the O
fact O
that O
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
had O
had O
to O
empty O
a O
cart O
of O
coals O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
. O

Because O
he O
did O
it O
using O
his O
hands O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
used O
it O
as O
a O
pretext O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
sabotage O
. O

When O
he O
was O
coming O
back O
from O
work B-TER
, O
after O
having O
fasted O
, O
done O
heavy B-TER
work I-TER
, O
suffered O
beating O
etc O
. O

the O
whole O
day O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
shot B-TER
him O
in O
public O
. O

But O
a O
pit O
for O
him O
had O
already O
been O
dug O
and O
waiting O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
. O

It O
means O
that O
Schwammberger B-PER
had O
been O
preparing O
for O
the O
joyous O
spectacle O
: O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
and O
a O
rabbi B-TER
! O
The O
Gestapo B-ORG
agent O
Nowak B-PER
boasted O
in O
front O
of O
us O
: O
I O
have O
already O
dealt O
with O
1893 O
Jews O
and O
shot O
them O
as O
dogs O
! O
An O
elderly O
Jew O
reported O
: O
I O
have O
a O
swollen O
foot O
. O

It O
hurts O
! O
Oh O
, O
you O
poor O
one O
, O
your O
foot O
hurts O
? O
Zeig O
mal O
! O
The O
Jew O
showed O
it O
slowly O
. O

And O
the O
Nazi O
slowly O
stepped O
on O
the O
ailing O
foot O
and O
crushed O
it O
so O
long O
that O
the O
Jew O
almost O
lost O
consciousness O
– O
and O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
him O
. O

In O
Stalowa B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
( O
after O
Rozwadów B-LOC
) O
in O
the O
territory O
where O
we O
worked B-TER
every O
inch O
of O
the O
ground O
was O
a O
tomb O
. O

Before O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
evacuated B-TER
all O
the O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
so O
that O
they O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
happened O
there O
. O

The O
territory O
was O
covered O
with O
tents O
, O
[ O
they O
] O
walked O
around O
with O
gas B-TER
masks O
, O
looked O
for O
money O
and O
things O
on O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
buried B-TER
Jews O
and O
then O
poured O
liquid O
in O
the O
territory O
to O
burn O
the O
traces O
of O
cadavers B-TER
. O

Although O
the O
lunch B-TER
did O
not O
last O
longer O
than O
10 O
minutes O
, O
it O
meant O
that O
it O
was O
taking O
too O
long O
, O
and O
[ O
we O
] O
got O
beaten O
for O
that O
again O
. O

Going O
back O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
counted O
again O
. O

The O
counting O
would O
go O
until O
late O
at O
night O
because O
the O
numbers O
would O
never O
match O
; O
[ O
we O
were O
] O
beaten O
again O
because O
of O
it O
. O

Everyone O
was O
searched O
if O
we O
had O
n’t O
taken O
something O
with O
us O
. O

At O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
would O
eat B-TER
uncooked O
potatoes B-TER
. O

We O
would O
get O
bloody O
diarrhea B-TER
, O
twisted B-TER
bowels I-TER
etc O
. O

[ O
We O
were O
] O
not O
even O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
. O

[ O
When O
] O
someone O
would O
get O
sick B-TER
, O
[ O
he O
] O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

[ O
We O
would O
] O
go O
back O
in O
groups O
of O
five O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
warned O
[ O
us O
] O
that O
if O
someone O
would O
escape B-TER
, O
all O
[ O
the O
others O
would O
] O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
friendly O
groups O
of O
five O
have O
formed O
. O

Coming O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
had O
to O
march O
in O
in O
a O
hard O
- O
beating O
military B-TER
parade O
tempo O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
[ O
they O
] O
would O
start O
to O
count O
again O
for O
hours O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
all O
were O
tired O
, O
exhausted O
, O
wet O
, O
… O
, O
hungry B-TER
, O
beaten O
, O
sleepy O
. O

[ O
Then O
] O
again O
in O
lines O
for O
the O
supper B-TER
, O
water O
with O
dirty O
polluted O
cabbage B-TER
leaves I-TER
, O
that O
were O
given O
to O
eat O
to O
the O
Jewish O
pigs O
. O

One O
and O
a O
half O
hour O
in O
the O
line O
, O
getting O
beaten O
, O
pushed O
again O
and O
people O
would O
collapse O
all O
the O
time O
, O
victims B-TER
of O
the O
supper B-TER
queues O
. O

Finally O
, O
at O
11 O
PM O
[ O
we O
] O
would O
lie O
down O
on O
hard O
, O
dirty O
, O
humid O
, O
rotten O
boards O
. O

We O
went O
to O
a O
bath O
there O
one O
and O
only O
time O
. O

What O
a O
bath O
, O
we O
were O
awfully O
afraid O
, O
because O
there O
were O
deaths O
there O
. O

Coming O
back O
to O
the O
beds O
, O
we O
saw O
that O
all O
our O
belongings O
that O
[ O
we O
had O
] O
left O
were O
stolen O
, O
taken O
away O
. O

During O
the O
night O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
could O
not O
sleep O
because O
of O
the O
moans O
and O
cries O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
. O

Jews O
, O
help O
! O
, O
they O
shouted O
. O

Rascals O
wound O
count O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
shout O
: O
They O
( O
the O
sick O
) O
should O
be O
shot O
! O
We O
[ O
all O
] O
will O
be O
shot O
tomorrow O
, O
so O
what O
’s O
the O
difference O
, O
a O
day O
earlier O
or O
a O
day O
later O
! O
[ O
They O
] O
would O
stand O
outside O
and O
shoot B-TER
people O
. O

Sometimes O
during O
the O
sleep O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
men B-TER
would O
enter O
the O
barracks O
and O
shoot B-TER
at O
anyone O
that O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
sight O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
suffered O
thus O
until O
the O
15th O
of O
November O
1942 O
. O

On O
that O
day O
, O
250 O
from O
the O
remaining O
600 O
men B-TER
were O
selected B-TER
and O
sent O
away O
to O
the O
steel O
factory B-TER
in O
Stalowa B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
we O
were O
driven O
back O
with O
SS B-TER
guards B-TER
to O
Rozwadów B-LOC
to O
dig O
a O
grave B-TER
for O
all O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
. O

About O
30 O
persons O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
[ O
were O
] O
so O
bad O
, O
that O
soon O
60 O
[ O
of O
us O
] O
were O
unable O
to O
work B-TER
. O

All O
the O
time O
in O
sick B-TER
condition O
. O

90 O
persons O
from O
Przemyśl B-LOC
were O
brought O
in O
, O
all O
professional O
metalworkers O
. O

They O
all O
worked B-TER
in O
a O
canon O
factory B-TER
. O

Already O
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
a O
few O
were O
shot B-TER
because O
of O
communism O
and O
illness O
. O

In O
March O
, O
56 O
from O
the O
60 O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

Although O
more O
than O
30 O
from O
the O
60 O
had O
already O
died B-TER
themselves O
, O
Gestapo B-ORG
took O
accidental O
healthy O
ones O
and O
rounded O
the O
number O
to O
60 O
with O
them O
. O

( O
60 O
means O
60 O
! O
) O
The O
commander O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
Baudienst O
, O
Fischer B-PER
, O
made O
his O
debut O
in O
this O
round B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
( O
free O
workers O
, O
Polish B-TER
junacy O
, O
[ O
they O
] O
lived O
near O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
would O
often O
go O
away O
for O
vacations O
etc O
. O

) O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
the O
work B-TER
would O
often O
take O
even O
24 O
hours O
. O

[ O
He O
would O
] O
command O
: O
Sondereinsatz O
( O
a O
special O
, O
extraordinary O
task O
) O
. O

Many O
Jews O
lost O
their O
lives O
during O
the O
Sondereinsätze O
. O

Not O
one O
begged O
: O
Shoot O
me O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
strength O
to O
the O
Sondereinsatz O
anymore O
! O
This O
week O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
did O
this O
work O
four O
times O
already O
. O

It O
means O
, O
[ O
we O
worked B-TER
] O
for O
24 O
hours O
without O
a O
pause O
, O
normally O
12 O
- O
18 O
hours O
. O

That O
means O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
worked B-TER
for O
36 O
and O
for O
48 O
hours O
without O
sleeping O
and O
without O
eating B-TER
. O

During O
the O
rest O
time O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
cleaned O
toilets O
, O
carried O
water O
, O
chopped O
wood O
, O
cleaned O
floors O
, O
dug O
graved O
– O
and O
doing O
it O
[ O
we O
had O
] O
to O
hurry O
like O
mad O
, O
took O
blows O
, O
were O
shot O
at O
, O
and O
we O
would O
collapse O
while O
working B-TER
. O

In O
November O
1943 O
, O
the O
SD B-ORG
in O
green O
uniforms O
came O
. O

Their O
arrival O
meant O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

It O
was O
their O
mission O
. O

They O
travelled O
from O
camp B-TER
to O
camp B-TER
and O
liquidated O
them O
. O

Liquidation O
meant O
: O
Shoot O
out O
the O
Jews O
! O
. O

The O
director O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
Scholtze B-PER
, O
a O
major O
in O
SS B-TER
( O
but O
he O
) O
opposed O
them O
with O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
Jews O
are O
needed O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
( O
thanks O
to O
him O
, O
many O
Jews O
were O
saved O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
) O
. O

Jews O
are O
qualified O
workers B-TER
and O
without O
them O
the O
factory B-TER
would O
be O
forced O
to O
close O
. O

270 O
Jewish O
workers B-TER
from O
more O
than O
8 O
thousand O
Polish B-TER
ones O
! O
An O
intervention O
was O
made O
in O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
and O
after O
two O
weeks O
they O
[ O
the O
SD B-ORG
] O
left O
to O
Rzeszów B-LOC
. O

On O
a O
tour O
. O

In O
Rzeszów B-LOC
and O
in O
Przemyśl B-LOC
they O
liquidated O
the O
ghettos B-TER
, O
leaving O
the O
Ausräumung O
- O
Kolonnen O
( O
to O
sort O
, O
pack O
and O
send O
to O
Germany B-TER
the O
Jewish O
possessions O
) O
. O

Such O
columns O
comprised O
around O
300 O
persons O
. O

When O
the O
job B-TER
was O
done O
, O
around O
50 O
would O
still O
remain O
, O
and O
they O
would O
also O
be O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
end O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Ausräumung O
- O
Kolonnen O
from O
Rzeszów B-LOC
and O
Przemyśl B-LOC
had O
luck O
, O
they O
were O
left O
alive O
and O
brought O
to O
Stalowa B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
to O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
because O
the O
factory B-TER
needed O
workforce B-TER
and O
since O
a O
year O
had O
been O
continuously O
demanding O
some O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
. O

In O
1944 O
, O
the O
Soviets B-TER
bombed O
the O
factories B-TER
. O

A O
bomb O
hit O
the O
factory B-TER
and O
killed B-TER
3 O
Jews O
and O
3 O
Poles B-TER
. O

Our O
joy O
[ O
was O
] O
great O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
meant O
as O
the O
Soviets B-TER
were O
coming O
very O
soon O
and O
that O
we O
would O
be O
saved O
. O

Because O
some O
of O
the O
bombs O
had O
n’t O
exploded O
, O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
dig O
out O
the O
bombs O
and O
detonate O
them O
. O

German B-TER
officers O
gave O
the O
Jews O
precise O
instructions O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
bombs O
and O
themselves O
went O
away O
to O
observe O
[ O
from O
a O
distance O
] O
if O
the O
Jews O
were O
following O
the O
instructions O
to O
the O
letter O
. O

For O
two O
years O
, O
we O
had O
been O
planning O
an O
escape B-TER
all O
the O
time O
, O
we O
only O
waited O
for O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

One O
time O
at O
night O
the O
commander O
posted O
about O
30 O
Jews O
from O
his O
people O
along O
the O
fence O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
escapes B-TER
. O

Nobody O
knew O
what O
happened O
. O

Suddenly O
a O
commotion O
at O
night O
: O
these O
guards B-TER
had O
dug O
a O
tunnel O
under O
the O
fence O
, O
even O
under O
the O
electric O
wires O
, O
and O
escaped B-TER
. O

Because O
some O
Ukrainians B-TER
also O
stood O
guard B-TER
, O
the O
Jews O
organized O
everything O
so O
that O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
stood O
guard B-TER
all O
together O
somewhere O
else O
and O
the O
Jewish O
guard B-TER
all O
together O
[ O
elsewhere O
] O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
they O
escaped B-TER
. O

Hearing O
the O
story O
, O
no O
one O
knew O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-TER
did O
not O
know O
how O
[ O
the O
escape B-TER
happened O
] O
, O
but O
we O
knew O
how O
– O
[ O
I O
] O
went O
out O
in O
the O
darkness O
with O
a O
few O
more O
Jews O
and O
we O
tried O
to O
look O
for O
the O
tunnel O
. O

We O
found O
[ O
it O
] O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
, O
a O
few O
men B-TER
, O
pushed O
ourselves O
through O
and O
ran O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

The O
Jewish O
commander O
wanted O
to O
denounce B-TER
me O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
strangle B-TER
him O
, O
threw O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Hearing O
his O
shouts O
, O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
started O
to O
shoot O
, O
soon O
the O
whole O
guard B-TER
unit O
of O
80 O
Nazis O
arrived O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
shooting O
, O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
which O
was O
fenced O
with O
barbed O
wires O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
territory O
. O

The O
Nazi O
guards B-TER
that O
had O
arrived O
running O
, O
surrounded O
me O
and O
two O
others O
and O
shouted O
: O
Hands O
up O
! O
Seeing O
that O
I O
was O
in O
a O
trap O
, O
I O
ran O
to O
a O
pile O
of O
old O
metal O
and O
hid O
myself O
. O

The O
Nazi O
guards B-TER
had O
n’t O
understood O
what O
was O
happening O
yet O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
a O
landing O
operation O
. O

They O
had O
n’t O
even O
thought O
that O
some O
Jews O
had O
escaped B-TER
. O

Seeing O
that O
it O
was O
only O
me O
who O
had O
disappeared O
, O
they O
started O
to O
hunt O
the O
two O
others O
. O

They O
actually O
managed O
to O
catch O
them O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
them O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
seen O
them O
since O
. O

They O
spent O
half O
a O
day O
looking O
for O
me O
in O

where O
I O

People O
were O
exterminated B-TER
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
every O
day O
, O
a O
transport B-TER
of O
about O
twelve O

arrived O
. O

Three O

a O
day O
arrived O

. O

On O
average O
, O
the O
train B-TER
had O
60 O

After O

, O
the O
people O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
courtyard O

Within O

In O
the O

, O
there O
were O
towels O
and O
washbasins O

which O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
real O

After O
they O
were O

with O

Ten O
minutes O

A O

for O
many O
hundreds O

and O
carried O
out O
to O
piles O
, O
after O
which O
they O
were O
doused O
with O
gasoline O
and O
burned O
. O

Before O
people O
entered O
the O
stalls O
, O
their O
gold O
teeth O
were O
ripped O
out O
and O
women B-TER
’s O
hair O
was O

, O
the O
hair O
and O

The O

In O

which O
we O
did O
on O
August O
2 O

1943 O

Our O
first O

unsuccessful O
and O
twelve O

take O
over O
the O

begin O
the O
action O
around O
July O
12 O

1943 O

Having O
been O
unable O
to O
get O
into O
the O

that O
day O

we O
postponed O
the O

A O
few O
days O

, O
fourteen O
people O
from O
various O
work B-TER
columns O
who O

I O
was O
released O
along O
with O
a O
certain O
turner O
, O
whose O
name O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
, O
because O
there O
were O
no O
other O
prisoners B-TER
to O
work B-TER
in O
our O
positions O
, O
and O
despite O
being O
beaten O

Those O

but O
we O
heard O
the O
shots O
from O
a O
distance O

We O
did O
not O
stop O
working O
on O
new O
plans O
for O
a O
revolt O
, O
however O
. O

At O
night O
, O
we O
worked O
in O
strict O
secrecy O
. O

In O
each O
group O
of O
workers O
, O
we O
chose O
people O
, O
former O
soldiers B-TER
, O
who O
knew O
how O
to O
use O
weapons O
, O
and O
we O
assigned O

specific O
military O
tasks O
in O
the O
action O
and O
did O
not O
make O
them O
privy O
to O
our O

, O
and O
told O
them O
to O
wait O
for O
our O
signal O

We O
assigned O
three O
to O
set O
the O
barracks B-TER
on O
fire O
with O
gasoline O

I O
had O
the O
task O

which O
I O
was O
to O
do O
with O
eight O
other O

The O

gave O
us O
the O

Two O
boys B-TER
, O
18 O
or O
19 O
years O

, O
who O
worked B-TER
cleaning O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
observed O
the O
weapons O
storeroom O
for O
two O
weeks O
and O
had O
the O
task O
of O
getting O
inside O
and O
passing O
the O
weapons O
through O
the O
barred O
window O
. O

The O
masons O
were O
supposed O
to O
come O
with O
carts O
used O
for O
carting O
away O
rubble O
and O
take O
the O
weapons O
to O
the O
garage O

where O
there O
was O
an O
enormous O
cellar O

From O
there O
, O
when O
the O
signal O
was O
given O
, O
the O
weapons O
were O
to O
be O
distributed O
and O
the O
action O
was O
to O
start O
. O

The O
second O
and O
final O
attempt O
was O
to O
be O
made O
on O
August O
2 O
, O
at O
4:15 O
p.m. O
, O
which O
was O
when O
the O
fighting O
was O
supposed O
to O
begin O
. O

One O
of O
the O

, O
Jacek O

entered O
the O

storeroom O
at O
1:15 O
p.m. O
, O
the O
second O
stood O
at O
the O

Jacek B-PER
passed O
all O
the O
weapons O
through O
the O
window O
to O
the O
men O
with O
the O
carts O
. O

They O
took O
them O
to O
the O
garage O
. O

At O
2:30 O
p.m. O
, O
weapons O
began O
to O
be O
distributed O
from O
the O
garage O
to O
all O
the O
groups O
of O
workers O
throughout O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
. O

All O
the O
designated O
former O
soldiers B-TER
got O
weapons O
. O

At O
4:15 O
p.m. O
, O
when O
the O
action O
was O
supposed O
to O
start O
, O
I O
was O
waiting O
at O
the O
storeroom O
with O
a O
revolver O
that O
had O
been O
ready O
for O
a O
month O
. O

The O
detailed O
plan O
had O
been O
set O
for O
that O
time O
because O
a O
train B-TER

would O
pass O
through O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
it O
did O
every O
day O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
intercept O
them O
and O
have O
them O
join O
our O
action O
. O

They O
were O
not O
privy O
to O
the O
plan O
. O

At O
3:35 O
p.m. O
, O
two O
workers O
who O
came O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
for O
their O
things O
roused O
the O
suspicion O
of O
the O
confidant O
Kuba O
, O
the O
barracks B-TER
elder I-TER
, O
who O
summoned O
Hauptscharführer B-TER
Kittner B-PER
. O

Kittner B-PER
summoned O
them O
to O
the O
square O
in O
front O
of O
my O
door O
, O
searched O
them O
, O
found O
money O
on O
them O
, O
began O
to O
whip O
them O
and O
wanted O
to O
shoot O
them O
. O

When O
I O
saw O
that O
, O
I O
gave O
the O
signal O
to O
start O
the O
action O
through O
the O
back O
window O
. O

The O
tailor O
Zalcberg B-PER
, O
from O
the O
second O
barracks B-TER
, O
began O
shooting B-TER
at O
Kittner B-PER
. O

Kittner B-PER
started O
running O
towards O
his O
barracks B-TER
to O
get O
a O
machine O
gun O
. O

The O
action O
began O
. O

No O
longer O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
my O
task O
, O
my O
people O
and O
I O
cut O
through O
the O
barbed O
wire O
in O
order O
to O
get O
to O
the O
back O
entrance O
to O
the O
tower O
, O
where O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
were O
. O

A O
former O
lieutenant O
in O
the O
Czech B-LOC
army B-TER
, O
whose O
first O
name O
was O
Rudolf B-PER
, O
had O
the O
most O
important O
task O
. O

He O
and O
a O
second O
prisoner B-TER
from O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
took O
a O
heavy O
machine O
gun O
by O
cart O
with O
some O
people O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
zoo O
, O
went O
into O
the O
little O
tower O
and O
began O
shooting O
at O
the O
camp B-TER
’s O
headquarters O
and O
the O
guard O
posts O
. O

None O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
or O
Ukrainians B-LOC
who O
were O
there O
could O
get O
out O
, O
and O
they O
all O
died B-TER
. O

The O
barracks B-TER
were O
set O
on O
fire O
. O

During O
the O
fighting O
, O
many O
prisoners B-TER
died B-TER
, O
but O
almost O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
staff I-TER
at O
that O
time O
died B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

The O
whole O
camp B-TER
was O
on O
fire O
. O

I O
saw O
Kittner B-PER

man I-TER
Suchomil B-PER
die B-TER
with O
my O
own O
eyes O
, O

was O
killed B-TER
by O
a O
prisoner B-TER
who O
worked O
as O
a O
driver O
. O

His O
killer O
was O
shot B-TER
by O
some O
Ukrainian B-LOC
. O

The O
action O
was O
lightning O
- O
quick O
. O

At O
4:30 O
p.m. O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
, O
with O
or O
without O
weapons O
, O
was O
free O
. O

And O
we O
fled O
to O
the O
surrounding O
forests O
. O

No O
one O
chased O
us O
. O

Unfortunately O
we O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
include O
the O
train O
with O
the O
workers O
, O
because O
when O
shots O
were O
heard O
, O
it O
was O
stopped O
before O
it O
reached O
us O
. O

Everyone O
who O
was O

escaped B-TER
from O
Treblinka B-LOC

. O

Engineer O

Unfortunately O
after O
a O
few O
kilometers O
, O
his O
nerves O
failed O
him O
, O
he O
took O
some O
poison O
from O
his O
pocket O
, O
swallowed O
it O
and O
died B-TER
immediately O
, O
right O
in O
front O
of O
my O

I O
escaped B-TER
into O
the O
forest O
with O
a O
group O
of O
several O
other O
prisoners B-TER
, O
and O
after O
two O
weeks O
of O
wandering O
, O
I O
made O
it O
to O
my O
family B-TER
, O
where O
I O
hid B-TER

I O
was O
in O
the O

Kirshenblum I-PER
tells O
: O
I O
was O
born O
in O
Lublin B-LOC
in O
1905 O
to O
religious O
parents B-TER
. O

I O
am O
trained O
as O
a O
builder O
, O
but O
during O
the O
occupation B-TER
I O
had O
different O
jobs O
: O
loaded O
timber O
on O
the O
railway O
, O
took O
out O
rubbish O
and O
mixed O
concrete O
. O

I O
married O
in O
1928 O
, O
my O
wife B-TER
and O
three O
children B-TER
perished B-TER
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
on O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
1942 O
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
I O
lost O
my O
father B-TER
, O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
my O
brother B-TER
with O
his O
wife B-TER
and O
child B-TER
. O

Since O
1928 O
, O
I O
live O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
, O
Bielsk B-LOC
district O
, O
voivodeship O
of O
Bialystok B-LOC
. O

Around O
5000 O
Jews O
lived O
in O
the O
town O
, O
that O
is O
, O
66 O
percent O
of O
the O
total O
population O
. O

Most O
Jews O
worked O
in O
the O
industry O
of O
ceramics O
, O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
of O
accessories O
for O
shoemakers O
and O
in O
shoemakers O
’ O
and O
tailors O
’ O
workshops O
. O

There O
were O
also O
lots O
of O
artisans O
who O
worked O
at O
home O
and O
small O
shopkeepers O
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
encirclement O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
2nd O
of O
November O
1942 O
, O
around O
300 O
Jews O
from O
surrounding O
towns O
and O
villages O
were O
driven O
to O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
. O

Because O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
was O
a O
border O
town O
, O
right O
near O
the O
Bug B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
the O
was O
no O
possibility O
to O
escape O
to O
Russia B-LOC
, O
the O
town O
had O
been O
taken O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
already O
at O
dawn O
of O
the O
23rd O
of O
June O
1941 O
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-TER
that O
had O
been O
created O
every O
day O
about O
ten O
Jews O
would O
die B-TER
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
births O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
cases O
of O
mental O
illness B-TER
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
forced O
the O
whole O
Jewish O
population O
( O
including O
women B-TER
, O
children B-TER
and O
the O
elderly O
) O
to O
remove O
grass O
from O
stones O
by O
their O
bare O
hands O
and O
shot B-TER
three O
Jews O
, O
because O
it O
appeared O
to O
the O
German B-TER
overseers B-TER
that O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
work O
with O
enough O
enthusiasm O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
obliged O
to O
wear O
yellow B-TER
patches I-TER
. O

The O
local O
residents O
together O
with O
a O
few O
Germans B-TER
from O
Organisation B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
, O
that O
had O
just O
arrived O
, O
decided O
to O
bury O
the O
beautiful O
Lenin B-PER
monument O
that O
stood O
in O
the O
marketplace O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
Jewish O
population O
was O
dragged O
out O
to O
participate O
in O
this O
shameful O
activity O
and O
people O
were O
beaten O
extremely O
cruelly O
. O

One O
Jew O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
river O
while O
still O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
perished B-TER
. O

[ O
Another O
one O
] O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
Torah B-TER
crown O
and O
a O
tallit B-TER
and O
forced O
to O
hold O
a O
eulogy O
to O
Lenin B-PER
from O
a O
tribune O
and O
then O
to O
rejoice O
: O
Down O
with O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
! O
Jews O
were O
forced O
to O
cut O
off O
the O
head O
from O
the O
Lenin B-PER
monument O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
do O
it O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Polish B-TER
police B-TER
started O
to O
beat O
them O
. O

The O
bandits O
themselves O
smashed O
the O
monument O
and O
ordered O
to O
carry O
the O
pieces O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
. O

Only O
those O
who O
were O
found O
in O
possession O
of O
some O
meat B-TER
where O
arrested B-TER
, O
because O
Jews O
were O
forbidden O
to O
eat O
meat B-TER
except O
the O
tiny O
amount O
of O
bones B-TER
provided O
to O
the O
Jews O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

In O
August O
1941 O
Jews O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
contribution O
of O
140 O
thousand O
roubles O
and O
they O
were O
also O
subject O
to O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
, O
such O
as O
to O
clean O
rubble O
from O
buildings O
destroyed O
by O
the O
German B-TER
artillery O
, O
to O
transport O
construction O
materials O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
lacked O
horses O
acutely O
, O
so O
they O
forced O
the O
Jews O
to O
construct O
a O
railway O
first O
and O
then O
to O
transport O
the O
materials O
with O
bare O
hands O
( O
without O
locomotives O
) O
. O

All O
real O
estate O
that O
belonged O
to O
Jews O
was O
confiscated B-TER
and O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
give O
away O
all O
kinds O
of O
possessions O
, O
such O
as O
furniture O
, O
bed O
linen O
, O
dishes O
, O
gold O
etc O
. O

Germans B-TER
would O
also O
pillage O
Jewish O
homes O
under O
all O
kinds O
of O
pretexts O
. O

Jews O
were O
allowed O
to O
show O
themselves O
in O
the O
street O
only O
for O
3 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
from O
3 O
to O
5 O
PM O
. O

Except O
during O
these O
three O
hours O
, O
we O
were O
forbidden B-TER
to O
leave O
the O
apartments O
, O
even O
in O
order O
to O
relieve O
ourselves O
. O

We O
were O
also O
forbidden O
to O
open O
a O
window O
and O
to O
look O
into O
the O
street O
. O

In O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
created O
on O
the O
2nd O
of O
August O
1942 O
. O

During O
the O
moving O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
the O
Germans B-TER
checked O
all O
the O
packages O
and O
took O
away O
valuables O
. O

Every O
ghetto B-TER
resident O
had O
1,1 O
square O
metre O
of O
living B-TER
space I-TER
, O
the O
height O
of O
the O
ceiling O
was O
not O
more O
than O
2,5 O
meters O
. O

Germans B-TER
threated O
the O
newly O
created O
Judenrat B-TER
and O
the O
Jewish B-TER
police I-TER
very O
badly O
. O

Once O
the O
11 O
Jewish B-TER
councilors I-TER
( O
except O
the O
chairman B-TER
) O
were O
ordered O
to O
clean O
the O
toilets O
of O
the O
town O
and O
then O
transport O
the O
waste O
outside O
the O
town O
. O

There O
were O
no O
cases O
when O
the O
Jewish O
administration O
would O
give O
away O
Jews O
into O
German B-TER
hands O
. O

Jews O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work O
outside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
every O
day O
. O

Germans B-TER
ordered O
that O
the O
food B-TER
quota O
for O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
120 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
a O
working O
person O
daily O
and O
60 O
grams O
for O
someone O
that O
did O
not O
work O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
fortnight O
– O
100 O
grams O
of O
bones B-TER
, O
only O
for O
the O
workers O
. O

Those O
who O
went O
to O
work B-TER
would O
secretly O
bring O
back O
potatoes B-TER
in O
their O
pockets O
. O

There O
were O
no O
workshops O
or O
factories B-TER
inside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
paid O
a O
special O
tax O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
was O
taking O
money O
from O
the O
Jews O
all O
the O
time O
in O
order O
to O
bribe O
their O
way O
out O
of O
smaller O
troubles O
. O

There O
was O
a O
canteen O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
that O
prepared O
up O
to O
1500 O
lunches B-TER
a O
day O
. O

There O
were O
some O
cases O
of O
previously O
freethinking O
persons O
who O
fell O
into O
a O
religious B-TER
mood O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Our O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
existed O
for O
three O
months O
overall O
. O

The O
despair O
was O
immense O
, O
because O
we O
knew O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
liquidation I-TER
had O
started O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

As O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
was O
annexed O
to O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
, O
we O
believed O
that O
the O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
would O
not O
come O
so O
soon O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
repeatedly O
reassure O
us O
about O
it O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
the O
2nd O
of O
November O
1942 O
, O
at O
4.30 O
AM O
, O
when O
we O
noticed O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
people O
started O
to O
cut O
through O
the O
barbed O
wires O
and O
run O
in O
a O
chaotic O
fashion O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
opened O
fire O
and O
killed B-TER
a O
few O
hundred O
Jews O
. O

A O
small O
number O
managed O
to O
run O
away O
into O
the O
woods O
. O

There O
they O
founded O
a O
Jewish B-TER
partisan I-TER
unit O
comprising O
a O
hundred O
men O
. O

In O
autumn O
1943 O
this O
unit O
was O
largely O
destroyed O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
deportation B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
was O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
only O
. O

Although O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
signs O
menacing O
to O
shoot B-TER
anyone O
that O
comes O
near O
were O
hung O
out O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
no O
one O
actually O
guarded O
it O
, O
so O
the O
local O
residents O
would O
enter O
into O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
owners O
of O
which O
were O
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
, O
at O
night O
and O
pillage O
Jewish O
possessions O
. O

They O
even O
rejoiced O
because O
of O
the O
Jewish O
misfortunes O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
were O
also O
afraid O
, O
feeling O
that O
the O
extermination B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
own O
extermination B-TER
. O

Based O
on O
the O
testimony O
of O
Binyomin B-PER
Rak I-PER
, O
a O
resident O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
, O
I O
know O
that O
the O
final O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
happened O
in O
the O
following O
way O
. O

The O
Jews O
that O
had O
stayed O
in O
the O
ghetto O
were O
packed O
into O
freight O
cars O
and O
transported O
through O
Czeremcha O
- O
Białystok O
- O
Małkinia O
- O
Treblinka O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
much O
shorter O
way O
from O
Siemiatycze O
to O
Treblinka O
through O
Sokołów O
Podlaski O
( O
2 O
hours O
) O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
transported O
by O
such O
a O
long O
route O
on O
purpose O
in O
order O
for O
them O
to O
lose O
orientation O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
we O
arrived O
to O
Treblinka O
, O
but O
we O
were O
kept O
in O
the O
cars O
during O
the O
whole O
night O
. O

Only O
in O
the O
morning O
everyone O
was O
forced O
into O
a O
gas O
chamber O
and O
killed O
. O

I O
, O
as O
a O
qualified O
carpenter O
, O
was O
given O
a O
job O
in O
the O
workshops O
of O
Treblinka O
and O
managed O
to O
survive O
. O

About O
half O
a O
kilometer O
before O
Małkinia B-LOC
I O
jumped O
from O
the O
moving O
train O
through O
the O
little O
upper O
window O
. O

The O
window O
was O
very O
narrow O
and O
I O
had O
to O
take O
off O
my O
outerwear O
and O
jump O
into O
a O
- O
12 O
degree O
frost O
wearing O
only O
a O
shirt B-TER
. O

A O
few O
dozen O
persons O
from O
other O
cars O
also O
took O
this O
desperate O
step O
, O
but O
the O
guards O
shot B-TER
them O
all O
because O
they O
were O
a O
good O
target O
for O
German B-TER
bullets O
in O
a O
white O
field O
covered O
with O
snow O
. O

I O
alone O
survived O
because O
I O
did O
not O
start O
running O
away O
through O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
stood O
next O
to O
a O
car O
and O
pulled O
a O
German B-TER
guard O
by O
his O
coat O
. O

He O
turned O
around O
and O
dropped O
his O
automatic O
gun O
. O

I O
quickly O
picked O
up O
the O
gun O
, O
shot B-TER
the O
guard O
and O
took O
his O
revolver O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
do O
it O
all O
, O
because O
I O
was O
in O
one O
of O
the O
last O
cars O
and O
when O
I O
jumped O
, O
I O
landed O
towards O
the O
very O
end O
of O
a O
long O
train O
, O
where O
there O
was O
only O
a O
solitary O
German B-TER
soldier O
. O

During O
the O
first O
month O
after O
running O
away O
I O
hid B-TER
by O
a O
few O
Poles B-TER
in O
different O
villages O
. O

On O
the O
4th O
of O
December O
1942 O
I O
met O
five O
more O
Jews O
from O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
in O
the O
area O
around O
town O
and O
we O
dug O
a O
bunker O
for O
ourselves O
under O
a O
stable O
with O
the O
help O
of O
its O
owner O
, O
a O
Pole B-TER

There O
I O
stayed O

At O

time O
, O
a O

The O

office O

arrested B-TER
all O

in O
their O
own O
homes O
. O

Engineer O
Vigushin B-PER
and O
rabbi B-TER
Frid B-PER
were O
among O
them O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
the O
Gebietskommissar O
Hingst B-PER
issued O
an O
order B-TER
that O
was O
posted O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
buildings O
: O
Jews O
must O
give O
away O
all O
of O
their O
jewelry O
, O
gold O
and O
silver O
. O

And O
a O
second O
order B-TER
: O
Jews O
are O
forbidden O
to O
walk O
on O
the O
sidewalks O
and O
to O
travel O
by O
car O
, O

Jews O
can O
not O
set O
foot O
in O
the O
main O
streets O
of O
the O
city O

such O
as O
Zawalna O
, O
Mickiewicza O
, O
Trocka O
, O
Pohulanka O
, O
Zakretowa O
, O
Wielka O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
German B-TER
authorities O
issued O
the O
following O
order B-TER
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
poster O
: O
All O
Jews O
from O
three O
years O
old O
must O
carry O
patches O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
breast O
and O
back O
. O

The O
patches O
must O
be O
fabricated O
from O
white O
cloth O
, O
10 O
centimetres O
wide O
with O
an O
embroidered O
yellow O
circle O
and O
a O
letter O
J O
in O
the O
centre O
. O

This O
patch B-TER
was O
changed O
into O
another O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
on O
the O
breast O
and O
on O
the O
back O
. O

The O
patch B-TER
remained O
like O
that O
until O
the O
end O
. O

At O
that O
time O
roundups B-TER
of O
Jewish O
men B-TER
started O
. O

German B-TER
SS B-ORG
and O
Lithuanian B-TER
police B-TER
would O
round B-TER
up I-TER
Jewish O
men B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
or O
go O
into O
Jewish O
homes O
and O
take O
away O
both O
old O
and O
young O
without O
any O
difference O
. O

They O
would O
even O
drag O
out O
the O
sick B-TER
from O
their O
beds O
. O

By O
such O
means O
the O
SS B-ORG
would O
round B-TER
up I-TER
a O
few O
hundred O
Jews O
every O
day O
. O

It O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
for O
work B-TER
. O

But O
instead O
of O
work B-TER
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
would O
bring O
the O
Jewish O
men B-TER
to O
the O
Łukiszki B-LOC
prison B-TER
and O
from O
there O
to O
a O
forest O
12 O
kilometers O
from O
Vilnius B-LOC
. O

The O
forest O
is O
called O
Ponar O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
we O
thought O
that O
Ponar O
was O
a O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Gradually O
we O
became O
aware O
that O
it O
was O
a O
place O
of O
executions B-TER
and O
that O
the O
SS B-ORG
tortured O
and O
shot B-TER
about O
10 O
000 O
of O
our O
men B-TER
there O
. O

In O
August O
1941 O
rumours O
about O
closing O
the O
Jews O
in O
a O
ghetto B-TER
started O
to O
spread O
. O

The O
German B-TER
Gebietskommissar O
Hingst B-PER
and O
the O
Lithuanian B-TER
mayor O
Burokas B-PER
called O
a O
meeting O
with O
some O
of O
their O
employees O
and O
worked O
out O
the O
plan O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

On O
Saturday O
, O
the O
31st O
of O
August O
1941 O
, O
the O
German B-TER
authorities O
hung O
out O
the O
following O
posters O
: O
On O
the O
corner O
of O
Breyte O
and O
Glezer O
streets O
, O
the O
Jews O
have O
murdered O
two O
Germansoldiers O
in O
a O
terrible O
way O
. O

We O
have O
to O
take O
revenge O
for O
their O
blood O
. O

On O
Sunday O
, O
the O
1st O
of O
September O
1941 O
, O
at O
midnight O
the O
Lithuanian B-TER
SS B-ORG
encircled O
the O
streets O
that O
were O
largely O
inhabited O
by O
Jews O
: O
Żydowska B-LOC
, O
Niemiecka B-LOC
, O
Dziśnieńska B-LOC
, O
Jatkowa B-LOC
and O
a O
part O
of O
Wielka B-LOC
. O

Lithuanian B-TER
soldiers B-TER
entered O
the O
Jewish O
homes O
and O
dragged O
away O
even O
the O
old O
and O
the O
children B-TER
naked O
from O
their O
beds O
, O
not O
giving O
them O
any O
time O
to O
put O
some O
clothes B-TER
on O
. O

The O
women B-TER
wept O
and O
the O
children B-TER
cried O
out O
for O
their O
mothers B-TER
. O

The O
Lithuanians B-TER
drove O
everyone O
out O
in O
the O
street O
with O
no O
mercy O
. O

It O
was O
completely O
dark O
outside O
. O

The O
men B-TER
lost O
their O
wives B-TER
in O
the O
crowd O
and O
the O
women B-TER
– O
their O
children B-TER
. O

No O
one O
could O
orient O
themselves O
where O
the O
others O
were O
. O

During O
this O
provocation O
4000 O
Jews O
were O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
. O

The O
Lithuanian B-TER
SS B-ORG
encircled O
them O
with O
a O
strong O
guard O
and O
marched O
them O
to O
the O
Łukiszki B-LOC
prison B-TER
. O

From O
there O
the O
Lithuanians B-TER
took O
them O
by O
trucks O
to O

My O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
I O
was O
deported B-TER
from O

Treblinka B-LOC
along O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
, O
we O
were O
packed O
100 O
to O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

When O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
, O
it O
was O
already O
dawn O
I O
saw O
the O
Małkinia B-LOC
station O
through O
the O
little O
barred O
window O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
detaching O
groups O
of O
15 O
wagons B-TER
that O
went O
on O
a O
special O
side O
- O
track O
leading O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
when O
the O
wagons B-TER
stopped O
, O
they O
started O
shouting O
raus O
, O
raus O
. O

Women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
were O
separate B-TER
, O
saying O
good O
- O
bye O
to O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
to O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
side O
, O
where O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
sit B-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
ground I-TER
, O
telling O
us O
that O
the O
baths B-TER
are O
here O
and O
that O
when O
we O
are O
bathed O
then O
everyone O
would O
be O
reunited O
with O
their O

, O
would O
get O
new O
clothing B-TER
and O
we O
would O
travel O
on O
further O
to O
where O
we O
would O
be O
working B-TER
. O

At O
this O
point O
a O
German B-TER
ran O
up O
to O
us O
as O
we O
were O
sitting B-TER
on O
the O
ground O
, O
picking B-TER
out I-TER
30 O
boys O
and O
me O
, O
telling O
us O
that O
we O
are O
going O
off O
to O
work B-TER
, O
happy O
that O
I O
would O
see O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
again O
, O
we O
took O
us O
to O
a O
big O
yard B-TER
where O
there O
were O
huge O
piles O
of O
clothing B-TER
, O
suitcases O
, O
men O

and O
women O
’s O
shoes O
, O
baggage O
, O
money B-TER
, O
and O
mounds O
of O
other O
things O
, O
then O
the O
German B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
take O
off O
our O
coats O
and O
start O
working B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
consisted O
of O
sorting B-TER
every O
thing O
: O
shoes O
with O
shoes O

with O

Not O

, O
I O
asked O
a O
few O

, O
but O
no O
one O
gave O
me O
a O
real O
answer O
, O
I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
we O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
talk B-TER
to O
each O
other O
, O
suddenly O
I O
recognized O
someone O
I O
knew O
who O
used O
to O
live O
in O
one O
of O
the O
buildings O
in O
our O
courtyard O
, O

was O
taken O

he O
turned O

with O

, O
he O
told O

just O
one O
word O
: O

do O
n’t O
have O
any O
mother O
or O
sister O
any O
more O

Before O
he O
managed O
to O
tell O

what O
happened O
to O
them O
and O
how O
, O
2 O
Germans B-TER
ran O
up O

head O
with O
whips B-TER
, O
then O
an O
additional O
25 O
blows O
on O
our O
bare O
bodies B-TER
. O

I O
got O
up O

after O
we O
sorted B-TER
things O
for O
another O

o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
they O

with O
a O

, O
who O
then O
was O

for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
then O
they O
started O
to O
shoot B-TER
at O
us O
and O
torture B-TER
us O
mercilessly O
, O
with O
whatever O
they O
could O
. O

We O
pushed O
against O
each O
other O
like O
sheep O
, O
and O
when O
I O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
I O
was O
hit B-TER
on O
the O
fingers O
with O
a O
bayonet O
. O

After O
an O
hour O
of O
being O
chased O
like O
that O
, O
they O
killed B-TER
100 O
boys O
, O
including O
the O

[ O
who O
had O
stabbed O
Max B-PER
] O
, O
and O
chased O
us O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
that O
I O
managed O
to O
rip O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
shirt B-TER
off O
to O
bandage O
my O
hand O
, O
each O
one O
of O
us O
laid O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
crying O
and O
in O
pain B-TER
, O
to O
rest O
a O
little O
. O

The O
boys O
who O
had O
already O
been O
there O
for O
a O
few O
days O
or O
weeks O
already O
knew O
that O
we O
had O
to O
get B-TER
up I-TER
when O
the O
light O
was O
still O
grayish O
outside O
and O
wait O
until O
they O
open O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
did O
n’t O
open O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
they O
only O
threatened B-TER
us O
with O
machine O
guns O
and O
said O
that O
they O
would O
all O
kill O
us O
in O
a O
minute O
, O
so O
waiting O
impatiently O
for O
death B-TER
. O

They O
opened O
the O
barracks B-TER
only O
at O
11 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
shouting O
alles O
raus O
, O
they O
put O
us O
in O
rows O
and O
took O
200 O
boys B-TER
away O
, O
shot B-TER
them O
with O
a O
machine O
gun O
and O
herded O
the O

, O
punishing B-TER
them O
for O
3 O
days O
by O
giving O
them O
no O
food B-TER
or O

. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
a O
German B-TER
came O
to O
the O
group O
that O
was O
sorting B-TER
shoes O
and O
took O
50 O
boys O
away O
including O
me O
, O
telling O
us O
that O
we O
were O
only O
going O
to O
do O
some O
light O
work B-TER
for O
10 O
minutes O
, O
and O
took O
us O
through O
the O
whole O
yard O
to O
some O
gate O
, O
and O
when O
we O
went O
through O
that O
gate O
my O
blood O
froze O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
heap O
of O
dead O
people B-TER
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
bloodied O
boys O
going O
up O
to O
them O
with O
stretchers O
, O
grabbing O
corpses B-TER
by O
the O
hands O
and O
legs O
, O
they O
laid O
them O
on O
the O
stretcher O
and O
ran O
away O
with O
them O
, O
thinking O
about O
all O
of O
this O
, O
I O
looked O
on O
with O
tears O
in O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
felt O
a O
blow O
to O
my O
head O
with O
a O
riding O
crop O
, O
the O
boys O
who O
were O
already O
there O
for O
a O
few O
days O
told O
us O
that O
two O
boys O
should O
take O
a O
stretcher O
and O
carry B-TER
corpses B-TER
to O
the O
pit O
, O
I O
went O
quickly O
to O
the O
stretcher O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
stretcher O
back O
, O
we O
went O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
gas B-TER

they O
hit O
us O
with O
whips B-TER
, O
shouting O
: O
faster O
, O
you O
dogs O
. O

I O
ran O
to O
the O
ramp O
quickly O
, O
we O
put O
the O
stretcher O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
clumsily O
laid O
the O
corpse B-TER
onto O
the O
stretcher O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
the O
Germans B-TER
began O
to O
torture B-TER
us O
mercilessly O
, O
they O
threw O
me O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
head O
, O
shouting O
that O
I O
had O
n’t O
picked O
up O
the O
corpse B-TER
the O
right O
way O
, O
that O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
pick O
them O
up O
by O
the O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
lay O
them O
down O
evenly O
on O
the O
stretcher O
. O

I O
got O
up O
off O
the O
ground O
with O
difficulty O
and O
taking O
the O
stretcher O
with O
my O
friend O
, O
we O
ran O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
pit B-TER
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
pit B-TER
boys O
were O
running O
with O
corpses B-TER
, O
on O
after O
another O
, O
and O
coming O
closer O
to O
the O
pit B-TER
I O
saw O
another O
tragic O
scene O
, O
in O
the O
pit B-TER
I O
saw O
only O
a O
huge O
puddle O
of O
blood O
and O
when O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
pit B-TER
, O
they O
sunk O
into O
the O
blood O
, O
I O
carried O
corpses B-TER
for O
a O
whole O
month O
, O
then O
they O
moved O
me O
to O
the O
ramp O
, O
that O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
, O
pulling O
out O
gassed B-TER
corpses B-TER
. O

I O
pulled O
out O
corpses B-TER
for O
5 O
months O
, O
all O
of O
those O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
pits B-TER
and O
spread O
with O

, O
in O

the O
order O
was O
issued O
to O
dig O
out O
all O
those O
corpses B-TER
and O
burn B-TER
them O
, O
so O
3 O
diggers B-TER
were O
brought O
in O
that O
lowered O
their O
buckets O
into O
the O
pit B-TER

grabbed O

I O

I O

I O
quickly O

an O

cut O

asked O

me O

a O

days O

In O
the O
beginning O
he O
was O
not O

I O
told O
him O
that O
no O

he O
then O
answered O
that O
he O
would O
keep O

It O
made O
me O
very O

I O
was O
not O

I O
entered O
into O
a O
cellar O

spent O
all O
those O
days O

During O

I O
would O
go O
out O
for O
a O
short O
time O
in O
the O

to O
get O
some O

during O

the O

As O
I O

I O
went O
to O
the O
home O
of O
another O
peasant O
in O
the O

village O
, O
Bogucki B-PER
Jan I-PER

I O
knew O
that O

wife B-TER

has O
a O
room O
, O
closed O
with O

I O
asked O
her O
to O
let O
me O

I O
told O
her O
that O
if O
she O
wanted O
, O
I O
would O
knit O
her O

anything O

On O

Bogucka B-PER

tell O

that O
there O
were O

they O
were O
making O

I O
quickly O
left O
my O
hiding B-TER

and O
ran O
for O
the O
woods O
. O

In O
the O
forest O
, O
I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
hole B-TER
in I-TER
the I-TER
ground I-TER
and O
waited O
until O
the O
night O
came O
and O
I O
could O
go O
back O
to O
the O

to O
my O
hiding B-TER

At O
night O
, O
when O
I O
came O
back O
from O
the O
forest O
, O
Bogucki B-PER
told O
me O
I O
could O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
house O
anymore O
, O
because O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
found O
out O
about O
the O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
and O
he O
was O
afraid O
they O
would O
come O
unannounced O
. O

I O
left O
. O

I O
started O
to O
wander O
around O
the O
villages O
, O
and O
having O
no O
place O
to O
stay O
, O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
to O
get O
Polish B-TER
documents B-TER
. O

On O
the O
25th O
of O
December O
1942 O
I O
went O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

Immediately O
upon O
my O
arrival O
, O
I O
entered O
a O
church O
on O
Chłodna B-LOC
street I-LOC
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
obtain O
a O
birth B-TER
certificate I-TER
from O
a O
priest B-TER
. O

When O
I O
entered O
the O
church O
, O
I O
approached O
a O
priest B-TER
and O
asked O
for O
a O
birth B-TER
certificate I-TER
. O

He O
started O
to O
look O
for O
my O
name O
and O
surname O
in O
the O
registers O
. O

He O
told O
me O
I O
was O
not O
registered O
. O

He O
promised O
to O
issue O
me O
a O
birth B-TER
certificate I-TER
if O
I O
brought O
witnesses O
or O
a O
godmother O
. O

I O
agreed O
. O

I O
went O
out O
in O
the O
street O
to O
look O
for O
some O
woman B-TER
who O
could O
testify O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
. O

While O
searching O
, O
I O
met O
a O
woman B-TER
whom O
I O
asked O
to O
go O
to O
church O
with O
me O
. O

When O
she O
asked O
me O
, O
for O
what O
reason O
, O
I O
told O
her O
I O
would O
tell O
her O
in O
the O
church O
. O

She O
asked O
me O
again O
where O
I O
was O
taking O
her O
, O
and O
then O
I O
told O
her O
I O
wanted O
her O
to O
testify O
to O
the O
priest B-TER
that O
I O
had O
been O
baptized B-TER
in O
the O
church O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
she O
refused O
, O
but O
when O
I O
gave O
her O
half O
a O
kilo O
butter O
, O
she O
agreed O
to O
go O
with O
me O
. O

The O
priest B-TER
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
brought O
a O
godmother O
, O
issued O
me O
a O
birth B-TER
certificate I-TER
explaining O
that O
I O
was O
registered O
, O
but O
the O
register O
book O
had O
been O
lost O
. O

With O
the O
certificate B-TER
I O
went O
back O
to O
Czyżew B-LOC
. O

I O
looked O
for O
work O
in O
a O
manor O
, O
telling O
that O
I O
came O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
because O
people O
starve O
there O
. O

The O
German B-TER
, O
not O
suspecting O
anything O
, O
gave O
me O
a O
job O
. O

The O
farm O
where O
I O
worked O
was O
not O
far O
away O
from O
Czyżew B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
10th O
of O
April O
police B-TER
came O
to O
the O
farm O
looking O
for O
a O
Jewish O
girl O
with O
long O
braids O
. O

It O
was O
me O
. O

When O
I O
heard O
about O
it O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
run O
away O
, O
but O
the O
farm O
had O
already O
been O
surrounded O
by O
lots O
of O
police B-TER
. O

They O
started O
to O
look O
in O
all O
the O
buildings O
and O
could O
not O
find O
anyone O
in O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O

Kowalski B-PER
Stefan I-PER
from O
[ O
H]elenowo B-LOC

Koty I-LOC
, O
was O
also O
with O
them O
and O
he O
recognized O
me O
and O
gave O
me O
in O
, O
because O
he O
noticed O
me O
working O
in O
the O
manor O
. O

When O
he O
saw O
me O
, O
he O
called O
all O
the O

to O
come O
. O

He O
showed O
me O
, O
telling O
them O
that O
I O
was O
a O
Jewish O
girl O
. O

He O
even O
pronounced O
my O
name O

Then O
they O
made O
me O
stand O
against O
a O

and O
started O
to O
interrogate B-TER
me O
to O
see O
if O
I O
was O
the O
person O
the O
policeman B-TER
claimed O
I O
was O
. O

I O
said O
no O
, O
I O
came O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
because O
I O
was O
starving O
there O
. O

The O
policeman B-TER
who O
recognized O
me O
told O
me O
I O
was O
telling O
a O
lie O
. O

Then O
they O
started O
asking O
me O
all O
kinds O
of O
questions O
about O
Warsaw B-LOC
and O
made O
me O
recite O
Christian B-TER
prayers O
, O
thinking O
that O
I O
could O
not O
answer O
correctly O
if O
I O
was O
Jewish O
. O

But O
I O
had O
already O
learnt O
everything O
and O
recited O
it O
by O
heart O
as O
a O
Polish B-TER
woman B-TER
would O
. O

After O
long O
hours O
, O
seeing O
that O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
confusedly O
and O
that O
they O
can O
not O
get O
anything O
out O
of O
me O
, O
they O
beat O
the O
policeman B-TER
Kowalski B-PER
and O
let O
me O
go O
free O
, O
thinking O
that O
I O
was O
Polish B-TER
. O

But O
they O
ordered O
me O
to O
come O
to O
Czyżew B-LOC
, O
because O
they O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
phone O
call O
to O
my O
parents B-TER
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

When O
they O
left O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
, O
but O
then O
decided O
to O
stay O
. O

On O
the O
11th O
of O
April O
, O
I O
came O
at O
the O
appointed O
time O
. O

I O
told O
them O
an O
invented O
address O
and O
they O
started O
telephoning O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

When O
they O
received O
an O
answer O
that O
such O
family B-TER
was O
not O
to O
be O
found O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
shoot B-TER
me O
for O
deceiving O
them O
. O

But O
I O
had O
one O
more O
idea O
: O
I O
asked O
them O
to O
telephone O
to O
the O
magistrate O
, O
explaining O
than O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
my O
mother B-TER
had O
moved O
to O
another O
apartment O
. O

They O
did O
what O
I O
said O
, O
telephoned O
, O
found O
out O
that O
I O
was O
not O
Jewish O
and O
let O
me O
go O
. O

They O
drove O
me O
back O
home O
. O

When O
the O
German B-TER
saw O
me O
, O
he O
told O
me O
I O
was O
alive O
because O
I O
had O
remained O
cold O
- O
blooded O
and O
calm O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
work O
in O
the O
fields O
, O
I O
was O
a O
handmaid O
in O
his O
house O
. O

Jewish O
militiamen O
who O
wanted O
to O

a O
Lager B-TER

In O
September O
1942 O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
ghetto B-TER
: O
In O
the O
ghetto B-TER
( O
Ordnungsdienstmänner O
) O
came O
every O
day O
( O
at O
5 O
a.m. O
) O
; O
they O
smashed O
doors O
and O

, O
rushed O
into O
the O
small O
, O
dark O
apartment B-TER
and O
frequently O
beat B-TER
me I-TER
up I-TER
with O
hunting B-TER
crops I-TER

take I-TER
a I-TER

, O
and O

, O
where O
I O
had O
to O
stand O

all O
night O

to O
prevent O

. O

On O

1942 O
they O
made O
a O
pogrom O
against O
us O
, O
that O
is O
an O
action O
, O
in O
which O
they O
took O
my O
father O
; O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
to O
the O
attic B-TER
; O
I O
found O
a O
60 O
cm3 O
hen O
house O
there O
, O
where O
I O
stayed O
all O
day O
. O

At O
about O
2 O
p.m. O
a O
woman B-TER
with O
a O
little B-TER
child I-TER
in O
her O
arms O
climbed O
to O
the O

where O
I O
was O
hidden B-TER
with O
my O
sisters O
, O
and O
sat O
near O
the O
hen O
house O
. O

Presently O
the O
child B-TER
began O
to O
cry O
; O
Schupo O
men O
in O
the O
text O
: O
„ O
szybowcy O
” O
soon O
heard O
him O
and O
ran O
to O
the O
attic B-TER
. O

In O
the O
attic B-TER
they O
took O
that O
woman B-TER
as O
well O
as O
20 O
other O
people B-TER
who I-TER
were I-TER
hiding I-TER
in O
the O

( O

- O
My O

and O
he O
answered O
: O

) O
( O

Me O
in O
my O
hen O
house O
and O
my O
sisters O
under O
planks B-TER
remained O
in O
the O

. O

At O
night O
we O
went O
down O
; O
our O
daddy O
was O
gone O
, O
that O
is O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
taken O
him O
. O

And O
we O
became O
orphans B-TER
. O

And O
so O
, O
as O
a O
poor O
prisoner B-TER
- O
a O
young B-TER
orphan I-TER
– O
I O
had O
to O
go O
on O

working B-TER
for I-TER
the I-TER
fascists I-TER

In O
March O

and O
at O
night O
drunk O

came O
, O
beat B-TER

On O

1943 O
the O

I O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
Lager B-TER
and O

( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
took O
direction O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
to O
Volhynia B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
I O
had O
to O
cross B-TER
the I-TER
border I-TER
: O
Volhynia B-LOC
– O
Galicia B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
crossing B-TER
the I-TER
border I-TER
near O
the O
village O
of O
Józefka B-LOC
: O
The O
night O
was O
dark O
; O
it O
was O
very O
dark O
; O
I O
was O
crossing B-TER
that I-TER
border I-TER
at O
11.30 O
p.m. O
and O
I O
ran O
into O
a O
German B-TER
ambush O
, O
which O
consisted O
of O
35 O
Germans B-TER
and O
Uzbeks B-TER
. O

They O
lighted O
the O
field O
with O
[ O
signal O
] O
rockets O
; O
I O
began O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
from O
the O
place O
. O

They O
surrounded O
me O
and O
began O
to B-TER
shoot I-TER
at O
me O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
pay O
attention O
to O
that O
shooting B-TER
( O
as O
I O
knew O
very O
well O
it O
was O
death O
all O
the O
same O
) O
so O
I O
began O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
even O
faster O
. O

I O
ran O
until O
two O
Germans B-TER
grabbed O
me O
by O
the O
hands O
and O
neck O
. O

Soon O
, O
more O
Germans B-TER
and O
Uzbeks B-TER

( O

) O
– O
traitors O
of O

– O
text O
written O

came O
running O
and O
they O
dragged O
me O
to O
Józefka B-LOC
to O
the O
station O
– O
the O
border O
one O
, O
where O
they O
stripped B-TER
me I-TER
naked I-TER
and I-TER
beat I-TER
me I-TER
terribly I-TER
and O
wrote B-TER
a I-TER
report I-TER
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
answer O
the O
questions O
so O
they O
beat B-TER
me I-TER
all I-TER
the I-TER
harder I-TER
till O
5 O
a.m. O
Then O
the O
commanding O
officer O
of O
the O
zastawa O
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
a O
border O
station O
came O
and O
said O
I O
should O
be O
hanged B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
talked O
between O
themselves O
and O
I B-TER
was I-TER
sentenced I-TER
to I-TER
be I-TER
shot I-TER
. O

At O
5.30 O
I O
was O
led O
out O
under O
the O
escort O
of O
2 O
Germans B-TER
and O
2 O
Uzbeks B-TER
and O
the O
commanding O
officer O
himself O
, O
and O
they O
drove O
me O
to O
the O
forest O
to O
shoot B-TER
me O
. O

In O
the O
forest B-TER
they O
surrounded O
me O
; O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
shovel O
, O
and O
the O
commanding O
officer O
outlined O
a O
pit B-TER
for O
my O
size O
and O
told O
me O
to O
dig O
. O

So O
I O
turned O
to O
the O
Uzbeks B-TER
and O
said O
Shto O
ya O
vam O
sdelal O
? O
Za O
shto O

budete O

? O
( O

) O
– O
What O
have O
I O
done O
to O
you O
? O
Why O
are O
you O
going O
to O
shoot O
me O
, O
a O
youngster O
? O
– O

written O
in O

And O
they O
answer O
Ladno O
, O

. O

( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
OK O
. O

, O
dig O
! O
– O
text O
written O
in O
Cyrillic O
alphabet O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
my O
revenge O
before O
death B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
told O
me O
to O
take O
off O
my O
jacket B-TER
. O

I O
stood O
the O
shovel O
in O
front O
of O
the O
commanding O
officer O
, O
took O
off O
my O
jacket B-TER
and O
handed O
it O
to O
a O
German B-TER
. O

I O
took O
the O
shovel O
into O
my O
hands O
, O
sprang B-TER
up I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
commanding I-TER
officer I-TER
and O
chopped O
his O
head O
open O
. O

That O
moment O
the O
fryc B-TER
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
- O
a O
pejorative O
term O
for O
a O
German O
came O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
I O
jumped O
over O
him O
, O
sprang B-TER
2 O
- O
3 O
m O
away O
, O
got O
caught O
on O
a O
bush O
and O
fell O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
heard O
shots O
; O
I O
jumped O
to O
my O
feet O
and O
wanted O
to O
run O
further O
so O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
n’t O
catch O
me O
alive O
and O
cut O
me O
up O
, O
but O
only O
shoot O
me O
during O
the O
flight O
( O
from O
behind O
) O
. O

I O
broke O
20 O
to O
30 O
meters O
away O
from O
them O
and O
saw O
I O
was O
still O
alive O
and O
would O
be O
able O
to O
run O
away O
perhaps O
. O

So O
I O
began O
to O
run O
faster O
. O

I O
flew O
like O
a O
bird O
between O
the O
bushes O
. O

I O
had O
run O
some O
2 O
km O
, O
so O
I O
stopped O
to O
find O
out O
where O
I O
was O
. O

Where O
should O
I O
run O
? O
I O
crawled O
under O
a O
bush O
, O
covered B-TER
myself O
with O
moss O
so O
that O
nobody O
would O
notice O
me O
. O

I O
lay B-TER
there O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
; O
suddenly O
, O
I O
hear O
a O
clatter O
of O
a O
wagon O
; O
I O
look O
and O
see O
a O
farmer O
driving O
one O
horse B-TER
; O
he O
’s O
driving O
very O
slowly O
and O
looking O
all O
around O
him O
. O

I O
sneaked O
out O
of O
those O
bushes B-TER
, O
went O
up O
to O
the O
road O
and O
asked O
him O
very O
quietly O
: O
Which O
way O
should O
I O
go O
to O
Gruszów B-LOC
, O
mister O
? O
The O
farmer O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
me O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
him O
: O
And O
what O
are O
those O
houses O
near O
here O
? O
The O
farmer O
answered O
: O
It O
’s O
the O
border O
station O
in O
Szarpańce O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
the O
where O
is O
that O
border O
? O
So O
the O
farmer O
turned O
around O
and O
showed O
me O
a O
plate O
with O
the O
inscription O
Grenze O
, O
( O
Ger O
. O

) O
– O
border O
that O
was O
stuck O
to O
a O
thick O
oak O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
Oh O
God O
, O
I O
’ve O
run O
more O
than O
2 O
km O
and O
I O
’m O
still O
on O
that O
damned O
border O
; O
I O
’ve O
almost O
run O
into O
another O
damned O
Nazi O
station O
. O

I O
also O
asked O
the O
farmer O
to O
give O
me O
something O
to O
cover O
myself O
with O
, O
as O
I O
was O
naked O
. O

But O
the O
farmer O
would O
n’t O
give O
me O
anything O
. O

He O
only O
said O
: O
run O
away O
quick O
because O
some O
Germans B-TER
are O
coming O
near O
here O
. O

I O
ran O
across O
that O
forest O
, O
ran O
out O
into O
the O
fields O
and O
reached O
Gruszów B-LOC
. O

I O
went O
to O
several O
cabins O
there O
. O

I O
pretended O
to O
be O
a O
Ukrainian B-TER
running O
away O
from O
a O
German B-TER
Lager I-TER
. O

I O
asked O
several O
farmers O
to O
give O
me O
something O
to O
put O
on O
, O
but O
nobody O
took O
pity B-TER
on O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
if O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
[ O
there O
] O
or O
the O
police O
. O

So O
they O
told O
me O
nobody O
came O
there O
except O
for O
Banderites O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
was O
samostyjna O
Ukraina O
! O
( O
Ukr O
. O

) O
– O
independant O
Ukraine O
So O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
: O
I O
’ve O
run O
away O
from O
one O
hell O
but O
got O
into O
another O
. O

I O
left O
the O
village O
, O
went O
into O
the O
fields B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
a O
scarecrow O
in O
the O
hemp B-TER
; O
I O
took O
that O
scarecrow O
; O
took O
off O
its O
torn O
jacket B-TER
, O
cap O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
thin O
wire O
; O
I O
went O
into O
the O
rye O
, O
dusted O
that O
uniform B-TER
, O
sewed O
it O
up O
with O
the O
wire O
( O
as O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
a O
needle O
) O
and O
the O
uniform B-TER
was O
ready O
. O

When O
I O
put O
that O
uniform B-TER
on O

at O
the O
time O

he O
fought O

: O
The O

Testimony O
: O
We O
lived O
in O
our O
own O
little O
house O
on O
Dworskiego B-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
Przemyśl B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
seized O
Przemyśl B-LOC
in O
1941 O
, O
my O
father O
still O
ran O
a O
little O
trade O
of O
various O
goods O
. O

We O
had O
[ O
money O
] O
for O
living O
and O
we O
did O
n’t O
lack O
anything O
. O

My O
sister O
Tosia B-PER
was O
4 O
years O
older O
than O
me O
( O
she O
was O
born O
in O
1930 O
) O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
the O
Jews O
to O
wear O
armbands B-TER
. O

Father O
did O
n’t O
put O
the O
armband B-TER
on O
for O
3 O
months O
, O
but O
later O
he O
had O
to O
, O
because O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
for O
not O
wearing O
it O
. O

In O
1942 O
we O
had O
to O
move O
out O
of O
our O
house O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
there O
my O
father O
had O
his O
store O
of O
various O
goods O
for O
only O
2 O
weeks O
, O
because O
there O
was O
an O
action O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
have O
stamps O
on O
our O
papers O
therefore O
we O
had O
to O
be O
resettled O
. O

My O
parents O
went O
to O
the O
gathering O
place O
and O
we O
walked O
them O
there O
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
cried O
and O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
be O
separated O
, O
but O
my O
father O
calmed O
us O
down O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
would O
come O
back O
and O
my O
uncle O
, O
who O
was O
a O
commandant O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
, O
Ordners- O
from O
Yiddish O
: O
policemen O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Police O
in O
the O
ghetto O
called O
Ordnungdienst O
Polizei O
( O
“ O
Order O
Service O
” O
) O
[ O
recorders O
’s O
remark O
] O
. O

took O
us O
to O
auntie O
’s O
apartment O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

My O
Aunt O
had O
permission O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
as O
a O
result O
one O
had O
to O
go O
through O
document O
checks O
. O

After O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
-man O
came O
, O
my O
aunt O
showed O
him O
a O
document O
and O
said O
that O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
we O
were O
her O
children B-TER
. O

My O
father O
and O
mommy O
did O
n’t O
come O
back O
and O
we O
cried O
a O
lot O
. O

Finally O
they O
came O
back O
from O
the O
gathering O
place O
, O
where O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
line O
and O
did O
n’t O
dare O
move O
. O

Our O
uncle O
Manek B-PER
Trau I-PER
, O
who O
was O
the O
commandant O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
, O
rescued O
my O
parents O
by O
saying O
that O
my O
father O
was O
a O
locksmith O
, O
although O
daddy O
never O
was O
a O
locksmith O
and O
did O
n’t O
know O
anything O
about O
locksmithing O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
end O
of O
July O
1943 O
, O
and O
again O
in O
November O
there O
was O
an O
action O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
had O
to O
move O
twice O
, O
because O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
made O
smaller O
. O

During O
the O
second O
action O
we O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
little O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
, I-TER
which O
my O
father O
covered O
with O
a O
wardrobe O
moving O
it O
forward O
with O
a O
rope O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
be O
able O
to O
recognize O
whether O
there O
was O
an O
entry O
to O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
behind O
the O
wardrobe O
. O

Gestapo B-ORG
-men O
went O
searching O
whether O
Jews O
were O
hiding B-TER
and O
they O
came O
into O
our O
apartment O
. O

They O
broke O
the O
door O
down O
with O
an O
axe O
and O
made O
a O
search O
of O
the O
apartment O
. O

Using O
the O
axe O
they O
broke O
down O
a O
buffet O
and O
a O
wardrobe O
, O
behind O
which O
the O
door O
to O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
was O
. O

Fortunately O
they O
did O
n’t O
move O
the O
wardrobe O
away O
. O

I O
was O
terrified O
when O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
-men O
were O
breaking O
down O
the O
wardrobe O
, O
but O
I O
stood O
quietly O
and O
did O
n’t O
cry O
. O

There O
was O
little O
room O
in O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
and O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
there O
for O
24 O
hours O
. O

There O
, O
we O
had O
bread B-TER
and O
water O
. O

We O
relieved O
ourselves O
in O
the O
bucket O
. O

Uncle O
did O
n’t O
come O
to O
us O
until O
the O
next O
day O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
told O
us O
that O
the O
action O
was O
over O
. O

After O
the O
action O
the O
quarter B-TER
was O
divided O
into O
two O
parts O
: O
one O
for O
employed O
and O
the O
other O
for O
unemployed O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
the O
quarter O
for O
working O
people O
, O
although O
my O
father O
was O
n’t O
employed O
. O

He O
had O
to O
hide B-TER
there O
, O
so O
the O
commandant O
of O
the O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
would O
n’t O
see O
us O
. O

He O
was O
a O
German B-TER
, O
an O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
. O

Children B-TER
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
quarter O
for O
working O
people O
and O
because O
of O
it O
we O
went O
out O
on O
the O
street O
only O
when O
the O
commandant O
was O
n’t O
in O
the O
quarter O
. O

In O
the O
quarter B-TER
for O
working O
people O
there O
was O
a O
Jewish O
orchestra O
, O
a O
little O
choir O
and O
a O
Jewish O
ballet O
. O

They O
performed O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
and O
when O
the O
commandant O
was O
n’t O
there O
they O
rehearsed O
and O
played O
for O
the O
Jews O
who O
ruled O
in O
theghetto O
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
premises O
and O
sometimes O
I O
snuck O
out O
of O
the O
house O
and O
went O
there O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
music B-TER
and O
singing O
. O

Janka B-PER
Haubenówna I-PER
was O
singing O
and O
Stegmanówna O
was O
dancing O
. O

On O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
of O
September O
1943 O
there O
was O
a O
third O
action O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

Daddy O
already O
knew O
before O
that O
there O
would O
be O
an O
action O
and O
hid B-TER
us O
in O
the O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
. O

It O
was O
above O
the O
attic O
, O
and O
the O
entrance O
to O
this O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
was O
through O
the O
opening O
in O
the O
roof O
, O
and O
then O
sheet O
iron O
was O
slipped O
in O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
notice O
. O

There O
were O
18 O
of O
us O
there O
. O

Among O
the O
others O
who O
were O
saved O
was O
Samuel B-PER
Hauben I-PER
, O
who O
in O
a O
few O
days O
would O
be O
killed B-TER
by O
the O
watchman B-TER
who O
patrolled O
under O
the O
fence O
surrounding O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

Hauben B-PER
stole O
things O
from O
the O
apartments O
abandoned O
by O
the O
Jews O
during O
the O
action O
and O
traded O
those O
things O
under O
the O
fence O
for O
food B-TER
with O
the O
Christian B-TER
tradesmen O
. O

Every O
time O
he O
gave O
50 O
zloty O
to O
the O
watchman B-TER
( O
who O
previously O
was O
a O
Soviet O
soldier O
) O
. O

Once O
he O
gave O
him O
only O
10 O
zloty O
and O
then O
the O
watchman B-TER
killed B-TER
him O
, O
thrusting O
into O
his O
mouth O
the O
10 O
zloty O
piece O
and O
robbing O
the O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
. O

After O
that O
action O
we O
found O
out O
that O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
would O
be O
liquidated O
and O
all O
Jews O
would O
be O
taken O
away O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
my O
parents O
decided O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
town O
at O
a O
Polish B-TER
woman O
’s O
with O
whom O
they O
were O
acquainted O
and O
with O
whom O
daddy O
had O
previously O
arranged O
. O

My O
mommy O
and O
sister O
left O
earlier O
and O
daddy O
and O
I O
were O
supposed O
to O
leave O
the O
next O
day O
. O

But O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
, O
because O
the O
action B-TER
started O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Daddy O
and O
I O
hid B-TER
again O
in O
the O
same O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
. O

This O
time O
there O
were O
20 O
people O
there O
. O

Other O
people O
also O
wanted O
to O
come O
in O
there O
, O
but O
daddy O
did O
n’t O
let O
them O
, O
because O
there O
was O
no O
room O
and O

Faced O
with O
this O
, O
the O
Jews O
who O
did O
n’t O
come O
in O
, O
threatened O
that O
they O
would O
denounce B-TER
us O
in O
case O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
detect O
them O
. O

And O
so O
they O
did O
. O

The O
next O
day O
German B-TER
soldiers O
came O
, O
they O
climbed O
the O
ladder O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
and O
started O
to O
beat O
us O
with O
axes O
above O
our O
hiding B-TER

place I-TER
and O
called O

Everyone O
came O
out O
except O
daddy O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman O
named O
Feuerowa B-PER
and O
I O
stayed O
. O

We O
hid O
under O
the O
feather O
bed O
, O
but O
a O
German B-TER
saw O
my O
father O
’s O
legs O
sticking O
out O
from O
the O
feather O
bed O
through O
the O
opening O
in O
the O
roof O
and O
shot O
in O
a O
way O
that O
wounded O
both O
my O
daddy O
’s O
legs O
and O
blood O
started O
to O
run O
from O
his O
wounds O
. O

I O
got O
scared O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
’ O
screaming O
and O
I O
yelled O
for O
my O
father O
to O
come O
out O
and O
he O
came O
out O
on O
to O
the O
roof O
with O
me O
. O

From O
there O
we O
went O
down O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
pushed O
and O
kicked O
my O
father O
. O

When O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
the O
building O
, O
my O
father O
saw O
Jews O
standing O
in O
the O
courtyard O
with O
their O
hands O
in O
the O
air O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
basement B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
then O
on O
the O
first O

First O

according O
to O
the O
American O

and O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O

We O
hid B-TER
in O
the O
basement B-TER
, O
covering O
ourselves O
with O
plywood O
that O
was O
there O
. O

My O
father O
threw O
the O
wrap O
that O
he O
had O
in O
his O
hands O
into O
the O
neighboring O
basement O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
searched O
the O
whole O
building O
and O
were O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
but O
they O
did O
n’t O
move O
the O
plywood O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
other O
basement O
, O
where O
they O
found O
the O
wrap O
, O
they O
searched O
thoroughly O
and O
even O
dug O
. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
until O
the O
night O
and O
later O
, O
wounded O
in O
both O
legs O
, O
my O
father O
dragged O
himself O
on O
all O
fours O
to O
the O
apartment O
and O
washed O
the O
wounds O
with O
water O
. O

At O
night O
my O

came O
to O
us O
and O
called O
over O
Dr. O
Schattner B-PER
who O
bandaged O
daddy O
’s O
legs O
. O

Uncle O
told O
us O
to O
hide O
, O
because O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
going O
from O
house O
to O
house O
and O
blowing O
up O
the O

, O
but O
father O
could O
n’t O
get O
up O
and O
stayed O
in O

The O
next O
day O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
and O
blew O
up O
the O

in O
the O
basement B-TER
and O
in O
the O
attic O
in O
the O
building O
where O
we O
lived O

but O
did O
n’t O
come O
into O
our O
apartment O
and O
in O
this O
manner O
we O
were O
saved O
again O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
under O
the O
wardrobe O
and O

The O
next O
day O

I O

mommy O
was O
supposed O
to O
wait O

We O
did O

because O
she O
had O
returned O

to O
find O
out O
what O

On O

Janek B-PER
recounts O
: O
There O
were O
seven O
children B-TER
in O
our O
[ O
family O
] O
. O

I O
got O
up O
in O
the O

The O
action B-TER

I O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
this O
way O
, O
Mom O
that O
way O
, O
younger O
brother O
this O

When O
I O
was O

a O
German B-TER
shot O
after O
me O
, O
he O
wounded O
me O
in O
the O

I O
fell O
. O

They O
thought O
I O
was O
dead O
and O
everybody O
trampled O
on O
me O
, O
I O
did O
n’t O
even O
gasp O
and O
was O
just O
lying O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
left O
, O
I O
got O
up O
and O
went O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
where O
they O
bandaged O
my O
head O
. O

I O
returned O
home O
, O
parents O
were O
no O
more O
and O
I O
was O
with O
a O
farmer O
I O
knew O
. O

Then O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
again O
, O
caught O
me O
[ O
and O
took O
me O
] O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER

My O

by O
a O

She O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
during O
the O
day O
, O
that O
’s O
why O
she O
did O
n’t O
make O
it O

that O

why O
my O

I O
escaped B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

A O
German B-TER
fired O
, O
wounded O
my O

( O
Janek B-PER
was O
wounded O
twice O
, O
in O

. O

But O
we O
did O
manage O
to O
escape B-TER
and O
we O
walked O
at O
night O
only O
. O

What O
to O
do O
… O
? O
We O
split O
, O
my O
brother O
went O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
I O
in O
the O
other O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
countryside O
and O
entered O
a O
house O
. O

There O
was O
only O
a O
Ukrainian B-TER
couple O
, O
I O
told O
them O
that O
I O
was O
from O
Drohobycz B-LOC
, O
that O
there O
is O
hunger B-TER
there O
and O
that O
I O
worked O
there O
. O

But O
I O
told O
them O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
work O
here O
. O

They O
were O
glad O
that O
I O
would O
herd O
cows O
. O

I O
spoke O
good O
Ukrainian O
because O
at O
home O
I O
used O
to O
play O
with O
the O
neighbors O
’ O
children B-TER
. O

I O
knew O
how O
to O
pray O
in O
Polish O
and O
in O
Ukrainian O
. O

I O
worked O
for O
them O
, O
I O
forgot O
Yiddish O
but O
sometimes O
I O
wanted O
to O
say O
something O
in O
Yiddish O
to O
a O
horse O
in O
the O
stable O
but O
something O
would O
block O
my O
throat O
and O
would O
n’t O
let O
me O
. O

A O
village O
head O
came O
and O
asked O
for O
the O
names O
of O
my O
father O
and O
mother O
. O

I O
said O
: O
Michał O
and O
Natusia O
[ O
Nastusia O
] O
. O

I O
made O
up O
names O
for O
my O
grandpa O
and O
grandma O
. O

Once O
, O
I O
was O
herding O
cows O
and O
I O
heard O
someone O
singing O
, O
a O
familiar O
voice O
. O

Anzelm O
Landesmann O
used O
a O

, O
he O
stopped O
, O
climbed O
down O
the O
cart O

he O
wept O
too O

Then O
he O
drove O
on O

I O
never O
saw O
my O
brother O
again O

I O
worked O
like O
this O
until O

In O
February O

we O

and O
bought O

For O

they O
were O

hiding B-TER

and O
all O
of O
them O
were O
killed B-TER
on O
that O
occasion O
. O

This O
delayed O
our O
action O
in O
the O

March O

At O
the O
beginning O
there O
were O

only O
30 O

Both O

They O
met O

And O
then O
one O
Jew O
named O
Blumental B-PER

a O

informed O
on O
them O

Thanks O
to O
Antek B-PER
Cukierman I-PER
we O
received O

from O
a O
Jewish B-ORG

That O

was O
brought O

on O
the O

some O

, O
and O
in O
September O
we O
made O
up O
underground B-TER
bunkers I-TER
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
dug O
- O
outs O
. O

There O
were O
four O
bunkers B-TER
for O
thirty O
- O
eight O
people O
. O

There O
were O
also O
girls B-TER
, O
about O
20 O
years O
old O
, O
among O
us O
. O

They O
cooked O
for O
us O
. O

We O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
because O
we O
were O
aware O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
liquidated B-TER
. O

We O
were O
also O
planning O
to O
save O
our O
families B-TER
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
it O
was O
too O
late O
. O

On O
August O
2 O
, O
1944 O
, O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
evacuated O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
front O
was O
drawing O
nearer O
. O

We O
obtained O
food B-TER
from O
well O
- O
off O
peasants O
and O
manors O
, O
and O
we O
paid O
for O
the O
products O
the O
pre O
- O
war O
prices O
. O

We O
went O
to O
get O
the O
food B-TER
at O
night O
, O
and O
we O
were O
armed O
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
we O
met O
Germans B-TER
at O
those O
peasants O
’ O
homes O
, O
and O
then O
the O
shooting O
ensued O
. O

On O
one O
such O
occasion O
four O
our O
boys O
were O
killed B-TER
and O
two O
were O
wounded O
. O

But O
also O
two O
Germans B-TER
were O
killed B-TER
, O
and O
we O
took O
off O
their O
uniforms O
and O
got O
hold O
of O
their O
arms O
, O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
forest O
. O

One O
day O
we O
met O
a O
German B-TER
lorry O
which O
had O
a O
cargo O
of O
cigarettes O
and O
canned O
food B-TER
. O

We O
killed B-TER
two O
Germans B-TER
, O
seized O
the O
cargo O
, O
and O
burnt O
the O
lorry O
, O
having O
first O
poured O
petrol O
on O
it O
. O

On O
June O
29 O
, O
1944 O
, O
we O
derailed O
a O
German B-TER
train B-TER
which O
was O
carrying O
ammunition O
and O
explosives O
to O
the O
front O
. O

On O
October O
4 O
we O
blew O
up O
the O
whole O
building O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Sudół B-LOC
Górny I-LOC

Hauptmann O
Hauptmann O

captain O

was O
staying O
. O

That O
Hauptmann O
was O
killed B-TER
, O
and O
we O
managed O
to O
run O
away O
. O

In O
November O
there O
was O
an O
ambush O
organised O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
because O
we O
had O
been O
given O
away O
by O
one O
forester O
who O
told O
them O
where O
we O
were O
hiding B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
came O
to O
the O
bunker B-TER
and O
opened O
fire O
. O

Certainly O
, O
we O
fought O
back O
. O

Eight O
of O
our O
people O
were O
killed B-TER
at O
that O
time O
, O
including O
those O
two O
girls B-TER
and O
one O
Russian B-TER
. O

As O
there O
were O
sixty O
Germans B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
withdraw O
and O
we O
fled B-TER
to O
the O
forest O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Czarna B-LOC
Glinka I-LOC
In O
the O
text O
: O
Czarna O
Glina O
. O

near O
Ostrowiec B-LOC
. O

We O
built O
three O
new O
bunkers B-TER
there O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
were O
harsh O
because O
we O
were O
persecuted O
by O
AK B-ORG
groups O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
wherever O
we O
moved O
. O

Only O
armed O
individuals O
could O
go O
out O
to O
obtain O
food B-TER
. O

We O
had O
run O
out O
of O
money O
by O
that O
time O
, O
so O
we O
took O
the O
food B-TER
from O
peasants O
without O
paying O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
December O
we O
were O
surrounded O
by O
a O
Hungarian B-TER
detachment O
which O
was O
allied O
with O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Severe O
fighting O
followed O
again O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
our O
people O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

Only O
six O
of O
us O
survived O
: O
five O
Jews O
and O
a O
Russian B-TER
. O

We O
escaped B-TER
to O
the O
forest O
in O
Ruda B-LOC
Kościelna I-LOC
near O
Ostrowiec B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
hid O
in O
bunkers B-TER
for O
three O
weeks O
until O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Russians B-TER
. O

We O
belonged O
to O
the O
Armia B-ORG
Ludowa I-ORG

We O
received O

from O
the O

: O
Aron B-PER
and O
Majtla B-PER
née I-PER
Skóra I-PER
; O
before O
the O
war B-TER
: O
a O
student B-TER
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
from O
the O
Sosnowiec B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
at O
Środula B-LOC
in O
February O
1943 O
. O

Thirty O
- O
three O
girls B-TER
, O
including O
myself O
, O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
Parschnitz B-LOC
( O
in O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
) O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
there O
we O
were O
barracked B-TER
in O
an O
old O
disused O
spinning O
factory B-TER
. O

250 O
other O
girls B-TER
had O
been O
quartered O
there O
already O
. O

There O
were O
three O
large O
halls O
changed O
into O
three O
large O
rooms O
there O
. O

They O
were O
equipped O
with O
wooden O
bunk O
beds O
, O
cupboards O
and O
benches O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
there O
were O
300 O
of O
girls B-TER
there O
altogether O
, O
and O
we O
occupied O
the O
room O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
and O
another O
one O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
. O

After O
some O
time O
, O
a O
year O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
we O
were O
joined O
by O
a O
transport B-TER
of O
600 O
Hungarian B-TER
Jewish O
women B-TER
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
and O
by O
about O
600 O
Polish B-TER
Jewish O
women B-TER
. O

They O
were O
given O
the O
room O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
, O
which O
had O
been O
empty O
before O
. O

At O
first O
our O
camp B-TER
was O
surrounded O
with O
a O
fence O
only O
. O

Then O
, O
after O
a O
year O
, O
when O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
command O
, O
it O
was O
surrounded O
with O
barbed O
wire O
. O

The O
Lagerführerin B-TER
was O
a O
German B-TER
woman O
named O
Hawlik B-PER
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
she O
treated O
us O
very O
decently O
and O
she O
took O
motherly O
care O
of O
us O
. O

But O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
later O
, O
her O
kindness O
was O
illusory O
and O
strictly O
calculated O
. O

She O
tried O
to O
convince O
us O
that O
as O
we O
were O
safe O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
under O
her O
care O
, O
we O
should O
write O
home O
and O
tell O
our O
people O
to O
send O
us O
valuables O
and O
jewellery O
which O
, O
as O
she O
argued O
, O
would O
be O
safer O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
than O
at O
home O
, O
from O
where O
our O
parents O
would O
be O
deported O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
girls B-TER
followed O
her O
advice O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
later O
, O
she O
took O
advantage O
of O
our O
trust O
and O
confiscated O
everything O
. O

As O
we O
also O
learnt O
later O
, O
she O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Thus O
, O
after O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
Hawlik B-PER
revealed O
her O
real O
face O
. O

She O
set O
specially O
trained O
dogs O
on O
us O
for O
the O
slightest O
offence O
. O

She O
robbed O
us O
of O
our O
rations B-TER
, O
which O
shrank O
visibly O
because O
of O
that O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
a O
textile O
factory B-TER
in O
Tratenau B-LOC
. O

Tratenau O
- O
Trutnov O
( O
the O
Czech O
Lands O
) O
. O

We O
had O
to O
cover O
6 O
kilometres O
’ O
distance O
on O
foot O
to O
get O
to O
our O
work B-TER
place O
. O

The O
way O
to O
work B-TER
was O
a O
hell O
, O
especially O
in O
winter O
. O

We O
left O
at O
5 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
groping O
in O
the O
mountains O
, O
up O
to O
our O
knees O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

The O
girls B-TER
often O
took O
off O
their O
heavy O
wooden O
shoes O
, O
which O
were O
a O
burden O
on O
such O
a O
way O
, O
and O
they O
preferred O
to O
walk O
barefooted O
. O

They O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
carelessness O
with O
pneumonia B-TER
, O
and O
sometimes O
with O
their O
life O
. O

The O
work B-TER
in O
the O
spinning O
factory B-TER
, O
where O
we O
operated O
the O
machines O
, O
required O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
. O

A O
slightest O
mistake O
could O
end O
up O
in O
a O
disability O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
hardest O
unit O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Feinsal O
. O

Feinsal O
may O
mean O
a O
room O
( O
Ger O
. O

: O
Saal O
) O
in O
which O
they O
spinned O
fine O
( O
Ger O
. O

: O
fein O
) O
yarn O
. O

My O
work B-TER
required O
special O
concentration O
. O

Our O
rations B-TER
were O
very O
scanty O
. O

One O
of O
the O
reasons O
was O
that O
Hawlik B-PER
, O
who O
stole O
our O
rations B-TER
. O

Thus O
, O
before O
leaving O
for O
work B-TER
, O
we O
were O
given O
½ O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
which O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
our O
dinner B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Our O
breakfast B-TER
consisted O
of O
12 O
decagrams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
bitter O
coffee B-TER
. O

For O
supper B-TER
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
each O
of O
us O
got O
three O
potatoes B-TER
and O
a O
spoonful O
of O
sauce O
. O

We O
became O
witnesses O
of O
horrid O
events O
two O
weeks O
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

Transports B-TER
of O
Jews O
evacuated B-TER
from O
various O
camps B-TER
went O
past O
our O
camp B-TER
on O
their O
way O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

They O
had O
a O
few O
days O
’ O
break O
at O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
that O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
selection B-TER
. O

Those O
were O
emaciated O
hungry B-TER
and O
miserable O
people O
. O

They O
were O
so O
changed O
that O
it O
happened O
that O
a O
sister O
failed O
to O
recognise O
her O
brother O
. O

Those O
unfit O
to O
physical O
effort O
were O
finished O
off O
at O
our O
camp B-TER
in O
front O
of O
our O
very O
eyes O
. O

The O
German B-TER
Aufseherinen O
found O
the O
spectacle O
funny O
: O
they O
looked O
and O
smiled O
. O

The O
Red B-ORG

liberated B-TER
us O
on O
May O

4 O

but O
ours O
was O

they O

Later O
when O
we O
found O
out O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O

us O

we O
went O
to O
a O

we O
lodged O

we O
drove O

and O
passed O
me O
onto O
a O
man B-TER
who O
stood O
on O
a O
stool O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

There O
was O
no O
glass O
in O
that O
place O
. O

I O
was O
then O
6 O
or O
7 O
years O
old O
. O

Mommy B-TER
could O
n’t O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
because O
she O
did O
n’t O
have O
money O
. O

A O
woman B-TER
sent O
there O
by O
my O
uncle B-TER
approached O
me O
. O

She O
said O
: O
Come O
with O
me O
. O

We O
got O
into O
the O
carriage O
, O
but O
because O
it O
was O
late O
, O
a O
policeman B-TER
stopped O
us O
and O
told O
us O
to O
show O
our O
papers O
. O

The O
men B-TER
, O
who O
were O
in O
the O
carriage O
showed O
theirs O
, O
and O
the O
woman B-TER
took O
me O
by O
the O
hand O
and O
we O
escaped O
to O
the O
barber O
shop O
. O

It O
was O
fortunate O
that O
they O
stopped O
the O
carriage O
right O
there O
, O
because O
the O
lady B-TER
had O
keys O
to O
the O
shop O
. O

We O
lodged O
there O
sitting O
in O
our O
clothes O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
went O
to O
the O
lady B-TER
’s O
apartment O
, O
I O
had O
some O
sleep O
and O
then O
we O
went O
by O
tramway O
to O
a O
certain O
woman B-TER
and O
my O
uncle B-TER
came O
there O
. O

My O
uncle B-TER
cleaned O
me O
and O
took O
me O
to O
where O
he O
lived B-TER
; O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
there O
, O
but O
it O
was O
impossible O
, O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
used O
to O
come O
by O
there O
. O

Uncle B-TER
took O
me O
to O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

After O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
give O
me O
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
’s O
acquaintance O
, O
but O
she O
said O
that O
her O
husband O
would O
n’t O
agree O
and O
that O
she O
knew O
another O
, O
a O
better O
one O
. O

She O
led O
me O
to O
that O
one O
and O
I O
was O
there O
maybe O
a O
year O
. O

It O
was O
good O
for O
me O
, O
uncle B-TER
used O
to O
come O
to O
me O
. O

I O
never O
went O
out O
, O
just O
sat O
in O
the O
room O
. O

Once O
my O
auntie B-TER
came O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
she O
stayed O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Auntie B-TER
sent O
to O
us O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
, O
who O
was O
sick B-TER
and O
had O
ulcers B-TER
, O
a O
Jewess O
and O
later O
a O
man B-TER
sent O
another O
Jewess O
. O

It O
was O
crowded O
and O
that O
lady B-TER
left O
. O

But O
she O
found O
out O
what O
they O
did O
to O
me O
. O

( O
when O
asked O
, O
he O
adds O
that O
something O
was O
done O
so O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
recognized O
as O
a O
Jew O
) O
and O
that O
the O
surgeon B-TER
, O
who O
cured O
that O
woman B-TER
’s O
ulcers B-TER
, O
did O
it O
. O

She O
sent O
to O
us O
a O
man B-TER
, O
who O
came O
and O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
a O
boy B-TER
and O
the O
mistress O
heard O
him O
wrong O
and O
asked O
: O
what O
? O
woman B-TER
? O
Then O
he O
said O
: O
Aha O
! O
There O
is O
a O
boy O
and O
a O
woman O
! O
He O
came O
into O
our O
room O
, O
told O
us O
to O
go O
with O
him O
, O
he O
took O
away O
her O
neck O
chain O
and O
500 O
zloty O
, O
that O
she O
had O
in O
possession O
and O
a O
coat B-TER
. O

He O
told O
me O
to O
show O
him O
what O
should O
n’t O
be O
shown O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
would O
come O
for O
us O
at O
12 O
. O

He O
was O
also O
a O
Jew O
. O

We O
escaped B-TER
. O

I O
and O
the O
host O
to O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
’ O
s. O
There O
I O
came O
across O
that O
lady B-TER
who O
instigated O
the O
search O
against O
us O
, O
and O
a O
man B-TER
similar O
to O
the O
one O
who O
was O
at O
us O
. O

He O
asked O
about O
the O
other O
one O
, O
how O
tall O
he O
was O
, O
how O
was O
he O
dressed O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Then O
my O
auntie B-TER
took O
me O
away O
from O
there O
and O
gave O
me O
to O
another O
lady B-TER
. O

Again O
this O
ill B-TER
lady B-TER
was O
afraid O
that O
something O
would O
break O
out O
and O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
close O
to O
her O
and O
she O
moved O
me O
to O
Piusa B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
because O
she O
was O
on O
Marszałkowska B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
would O
be O
close O
to O
her O
. O

When O
the O
uprising B-TER
broke O
out O
, O
auntie B-TER
just O
brought O
milk B-TER
for O
me O
and O
came O
to O
us O
. O

The O
husband B-TER
of O
the O
lady B-TER
, O
at O
whose O
I O
was O
, O
was O
a O
company O
sergeant O
in O
the O
uprising B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
told O
us O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
went O
with O
the O
whole O
house O
to O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
we O
lost O
one O
another O
, O
I O
almost O
lost O
my O
aunt B-TER
, O
because O
it O
was O
heavy O
with O
the O
knapsack O
and O
I O
walked O
slowly O
, O
but O
I O
called O
her O
and O
held O
her O
hand O
. O

We O
went O
via O
a O
goods O
train B-TER
to O
Pruszków B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
there O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
were O
in O
a O
ward O
, O
where O
the O
Russians B-TER
were O
, O
they O
played O
very O
nice O
. O

When O
we O
were O
leaving O
those O
Russians B-TER
had O
tears O
in O
their O
eyes O
. O

We O
went O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
they O
let O
us O
out O
in O
Łazy B-LOC
because O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
go O
out O
, O
but O
they O
led O
us O
under O
machine O
guns O
. O

People O
in O
Łazy B-LOC
said O
that O
we O
were O
going O
for O
death B-TER
. O

They O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
take O
us O
in O
Oświęcim B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
burning B-TER
120 O
000 O
people O
a O
day O
and O
did O
n’t O
have O
room O
. O

They O
detrained O
us O
in O
Mszana B-LOC
and O
from O
there O
we O
went O
to O
Kraków B-LOC
. O

Now O
I O
am O
with O
my O
auntie B-TER
, O
we O
are O
looking O
for O
her O
husband B-TER
and O
the O
whole O
family B-TER
and O
for O
that O
man B-TER
who O
wanted O
to O
kill B-TER
us O
. O

Now O
I O
wo O
n’t O
let O
him O
get O
away O
with O
it O

my O

we O
all O

I O
went O
to O

I O
kept O
my O
best O
memories O
from O

On O
June O
22 O
, O
1941 O
the O
Russo O

German O

broke O
out O

The O
day O

I O

my O

I O
had O
been O
on O
a O
school O
excursion O
, O
and O
nobody O
had O
been O
thinking O
about O
the O
war B-TER

In O
the O
morning O
terrible O
noises O
woke O
us O
up O
. O

We O
thought O
these O
were O
just O
military O
drills O
but O
then O
the O
radio O
and O
newspapers O
put O
us O
right O
. O

The O
evacuation O
of O
Drohobycz B-LOC
began O
. O

The O
army B-TER
left O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
unclear O

The O
worst O
was O
when O
the O
Bolsheviks O
left O
the O
town O

the O
Germans B-TER
still O
were O

there O

wanted O

his O

did O
not O

The O

At O

it O

We O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
summer B-TER

The O
Germans B-TER
did O

think O
that O
somebody O
might O
have O
hidden B-TER
in O
the O
summer B-TER

which O
was O
just O
by O

that O

we O
managed O

avoid O

Our O

Feiks B-PER

A O

The O

Those O

For O
8 O

In O
Ćmielów B-LOC
we O

I O
had O

They O
kept O
making O

Later O

In O
Belsen B-LOC

We O
would O

Food B-TER

they O
molested O

very O
much O
, O
but O
I O
forget O
the O

We O
did O
not O
work B-TER

Krämer B-PER
introduced O
strict O
rigour O
and O
relations O
deteriorated O
to O
a O
state O
worse O
than O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC

Next O
, O
we O
left O
with O
500 O

Aufseherin B-TER
Lanni B-PER

Americans B-TER

We O
were O
loaded O
up O
onto O

two O
weeks O

They O
beat O
and O
kicked O
us O
terribly O
and O
gave O
almost O
no O

Finally O
, O
we O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
where O
we O
were O
to O
be O
burnt O
. O

There O
were O
60000 O

The O

not O

One O

My O

Ignacy B-PER
Fornalik I-PER

, O
informed O
the O

that O

had O
been O
sentenced O

My O
son B-TER
and O
I O
were O
arrested B-TER
, O
too O
. O

They O
blackmailed O
us O
to O
swindle O
us O
out O
of O
money O
, O
and O
they O
got O
a O
pretty O
large O
sum O
. O

Spielman B-PER
was O
freed O
immediately O
, O
I O
was O
to O
be O
released O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
the O
boys B-TER
at O
night O
. O

But O
in O
the O
meantime O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
arrived O
, O
and O
they O
ordered O
to O
have O
Spielman B-PER
and O
his O
entire O
family B-TER
brought O
back O
, O
and O
apart O
from O
them O
also O
Hinda B-PER
Schnaps I-PER
with O
her O
two O
sons B-TER
and O
my O
entire O
family B-TER
of O

. O

All O
of O
us O
were O
handcuffed O
in O
pairs O
, O
and O
at O
7 O
pm O
everybody O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

I O
was O
at O
the O
very O
rear O
, O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
death B-TER
of O
my O
family B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
shot B-TER
Spielman B-PER
, O
who O
was O
handcuffed O
with O
me O
. O

He O
tumbled O
down O
, O
all O
covered O
with O
blood O
, O
and O
I O
fell O
with O
him O
. O

I O
was O
lying O
in O
a O
puddle O
of O
blood O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
thought O
that O
I O
was O
dead B-TER
, O
but O
they O
shot O
me O
in O
the O
arm O
just O
to O
make O
sure O
. O

Then O
they O
ordered O
Polish B-TER
policemen I-TER
to O
take O
the O
bodies B-TER
away O
. O

They O
removed O
our O
handcuffs O
, O
and O
when O
they O
went O
away O
for O
a O
break O
, O
I O
took O
advantage O
of O
their O
absence O
, O
raised O
myself O
and O
, O
dripping O
blood O
, O
managed O
to O
drag O
myself O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Moszczenica B-LOC
, O
20 O
kilometres O
away O
, O
to O
a O
Polish B-TER
peasant O
woman B-TER
, O
Adela B-PER
Jędrzejewska I-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
generous O
towards O
me O
and O
gave O
me O
shelter B-TER
. O

I O
learnt O
from O
eye O
- O
witnesses O
that O
on O
February O
18 O
, O
100 O
Jews O
were O
taken O
from O
Biecz B-LOC
. O

They O
were O
kept O
in O
prison B-TER
for O
4 O
days O
, O
their O
money O
was O
confiscated O
, O
and O
after O
4 O
days O
69 O
of O
them O
were O
shot B-TER
( O
the O
Schützer B-PER
, O
Gewürz B-PER
, O
Kleinman B-PER
and O
Wagschaller B-PER
families B-TER
) O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
Polish B-TER
police I-TER
was O
responsible O
for O
organising O
this O
action O
, O
and O
when O
they O
got O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
from O
Jasło B-LOC
, O
they O
had O
already O
killed B-TER
31 O
people O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
police I-TER
blackmailed O
the O
Jews O
and O
they O
swindled O
250 O
thousand O
zlotys O
out O
of O
them O
, O
saying O
that O
if O
they O
did O
n’t O
pay O
, O
another O
similar O
action O
would O
be O
carried O
out O
. O

A O
few O
months O
later O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
and O
shot B-TER
14 O
other O
Jews O
. O

Allegedly O
, O
the O
charge O
against O
them O
was O
was O
that O
their O
brothers O
were O
communists B-TER
. O

The O
names O
of O
some O
of O
the O
victims O
are O
: O

a O

of O
five O
, O
Kurz B-PER
, O
Jakóbowicz B-PER
, O
and O

with O
his O

In O
August O
1942 O
a O
liquidation B-TER
action O
took O
place O
. O

170 O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
and O
buried O
at O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
. O

700 O
people O
were O
loaded O
onto O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
transported B-TER
to O
Bełżec B-LOC
. O

Those O
who O
managed O
to O
hide B-TER
were O
hunted O
down O
by O
the O
Polish B-TER
police I-TER
and O
turned O
over O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

I O
and O
my O
brother B-TER
and O
two O
other O
Jews O
were O
hiding B-TER
at O
Jędrzejewska B-PER
’s I-PER
home O
, O
and O
around O
70 O
other O
Jews O
were O
in O
hiding B-TER
in O
the O

. O

The O
commandant O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
police I-TER
in O
that O
village O
, O
Bednarz B-PER
, O
was O
ordered O
to O
conduct O
a O
search O
for O
the O
Jews O
hiding B-TER
in O
the O
area O
. O

He O
warned O
us O
against O
the O
danger O
we O
were O
in O
, O
and O
we O
left O
Moszczenica B-LOC

On O
the O
following O
day O
, O
he O
assembled O
70 O
peasants O
with O
pitchforks O
, O
and O
ordered O
them O
to O
look O
for O
Jews O
in O
the O
attics O
. O

They O
certainly O
failed O
to O
find O
a O
single O
Jew O

Bednarz B-PER
risked O
his O
life O
several O
times O
to O
save O
Jews O

He O
was O

and O
then O
removed O

Wojciech B-PER
Bartosik I-PER
, O
a O
parish O
priest B-TER
who O
was O
very O
kind O
to O
us O
, O
entrusted O
us O
to O
a O
squire O
from O

[ O

Buchowski B-PER

who O

for O
driving O

in O

No O
one O
apart O

knew O

were O

. O

My O

later O
became O
head O
of O
a O
co O
- O
op O
warehouse O
, O
which O
gave O
us O
a O
very O
convenient O
financial O
standing O

but O
farmers O
from O
Wawrzeńczyce B-LOC
who O
knew O
us O
would O
come O
[ O
to O
the O
warehouse O
] O
. O

Some O
Pole B-TER
turned B-TER
us I-TER
in I-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
looking O
for O
us O
all O
around O
the O
neighborhood O
, O
they O
called O
by O
the O
community O
leader O
, O
the O
Buchowscy B-PER
, O
they O
found O
out O
nothing O
; O
eventually O
, O
they O
came O
looking O
for O
us O
to O
Opatkowice B-LOC

The O
community O
leader O
warned O
me O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
sent O
his O
daughter B-TER
to O
the O
warehouse O
where O
my O
husband B-TER
was O
working O
to O
warn O
him O
. O

While O
the O
girl B-TER
was O
in O
the O
warehouse O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
were O
already O
hovering O
about O
the O
yard O
. O

My O
husband B-TER
mounted O
his O
bike O
and O
escaped B-TER
, O
unnoticed O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Me O
and O
my O
son B-TER
went O
to O
Buchowskis B-PER
place O
, O
they O
let O
me O
out O
because O
the O
high O
road O
and O
the O
mid O
- O
field O
roads O
were O
all O
covered O
, O
and O
the O
train B-TER
at O
the O
station O
was O
delayed O
3 O
hours O
while O
all O
passengers O
were O
being O
searched O
. O

I O
took O
my O
son B-TER
to O
the O
barber O
’s O
to O
shave O
his O
hair O
so O
that O
he O
would O
n’t O
be O
recognizable O
and O
I O
overheard O
the O
clients O
there O
saying O
a O
penal O
expedition O
had O
arrived O
and O
had O
searched O
through O
all O
the O
bushes O
by O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
[ O
river O

. O

Meanwhile O
, O
my O
husband B-TER
had O
called O
by O
a O
priest B-TER
he O
knew O
in O
Michałowice B-LOC
, O
who O
put O
him O
up O
overnight O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Proszowice B-LOC
to O
see O
priest B-TER
Radosz B-PER
and O
ask O
him O
for O
advice O
. O

He O
reproached O
me O
for O
not O
having O
told O
him O
before O
I O
was O
a O
Jew O
, O
he O
would O
have O
arranged O
a O
job O
for O
my O
husband B-TER
in O
Radom B-LOC
, O
and O
he O
would O
send O
for O
horses O
for O
me O
now O
that O
would O
take O
me O
back O
to O
Michałowice B-LOC
. O

The O
day O
after O
a O
two O
- O
horse O
chaise O
arrived O
to O
collect O
me O
( O
I O
later O
learned O
that O
the O
priest B-TER
paid O
300 O
zlotys O
to O
rent O
those O
horses O
) O
and O
I O
traveled O
to O
Michałowice B-LOC
like O
a O
lady O
. O

There O
I O
met O
my O
husband B-TER
at O
the O
priest B-TER
’s O
place O
. O

I O
agreed O
with O
my O
husband B-TER
we O
’d O
meet O
in O
Cracow B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
utter O
hell O
in O
Cracow B-LOC
. O

Some O
Poles B-TER
we O
knew O
were O
afraid O
to O
take O
us O
on O
, O
we O
spent O
every O
night O
in O
a O
different O
place O
. O

Priest B-TER
Machaj B-PER
was O
very O
kind O
- O
hearted O
to O
us O
, O
he O
arranged O
for O
me O
to O
stay O
with O
the O
Norbertines O
for O
a O
few O
days O
in O
Salwator O
; O
he O
helped O
us O
out O
financially O
and O
recommended O
my O
husband B-TER
for O
the O
position O
of O
a O
mechanic O
in O
the O
Olszanica B-LOC
estate O
, O
7 O
km O
outside O
Cracow B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
left O
the O
nunnery O
I O
had O
nowhere O
to O
live O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
even O
though O
people O
scared O
us O
saying O
there O
were O
searches O
and O
lapankas B-TER
on O
the O
trains O
. O

We O
went O
without O
luggage O
, O
my O
husband B-TER
was O
only O
wearing O
a O
working O
outfit O
. O

We O
knew O
no O
one O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

What O
were O
we O
to O
do O
? O
I O
recalled O
the O
name O
of O
our O
Wawrzenice B-LOC
Correctly O
: O
Wawrzeńczyce O
host O
’s O
daughter O
’s O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
. O

I O
remembered O
she O
lived O
on O
Okopowa B-LOC
Street I-LOC
but O
I O
did O
n’t O
know O
the O
number O
. O

I O
went O
from O
house O
to O
house O
and O
finally O
found O
a O
door O
plate O
. O

I O
walked O
in O
and O
said O
I O
had O
some O
business O
to O
do O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
that O
my O
host O
from O
Wawrzenice B-LOC
sent O
his O
commends O
. O

She O
took O
me O
in O
a O
very O
friendly O
way O
. O

My O
husband B-TER
met O
his O
friend O
, O
engineer O
Marian B-PER
Pawełek I-PER
, O
director O
of O
a O
railway O
production O
plant O
in O
Pruszków B-LOC
. O

He O
helped O
us O
financially O
. O

I O
turned O
to O
RGO B-ORG
for O
clothes B-TER
for O
my O
husband B-TER
. O

I O
told O
them O
a O
made O
- O
up O
story O
of O
how O
I O
’d O
come O
from O
Proszowice B-LOC
, O
where O
several O
families B-TER
had O
been O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
for O
allegedly O
helping O
the O
partisans B-TER
, O
and O
since O
we O
had O
been O
friends O
with O
them O
we O
feared O
we O
would O
be O
finished O
off O
too O
and O
had O
come O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
with O
just O
the O
clothes B-TER
on O
our O
backs O
. O

They O
referred O
us O
to O
Ms B-PER
Goetel I-PER
. O

I O
dressed O
my O
son B-TER
up O
as O
a O
girl O
, O
put O
a O
blonde O
wig O
with O
a O
fringe O

She O

it O
did O

Two O

[ O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
we O
have O
to O
face O
the O
tragic O
problem O
of O
The O
Burgenland B-LOC
Refugees B-TER
, O
the O
full O
burden O
of O
which O
falls O
upon O
the O
Committee B-ORG

The O
Jews B-TER
of O
the O
Burgenland B-LOC

mostly O
families B-TER
settled O
there O
since O
centuries O
and O
distinguished O
by O
their O
conservative O
conduct O
, O
numbering O
about O
3,000 O

were O
- O
as O
is O
sufficiently O
known O

by O

compelled O
to O
charge O
themselves O

the O

of O
different O
crimes O

On O
the O
ground O
of O
these O
extorted O

, O
their O
property B-TER
was I-TER
confiscated I-TER
and O
they O
themselves O
driven O
out O
of O
the O

One O
part O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
was O
deprived O

all O

Among O

more O

£ O
100.000 O

have O
to O

not O

In O

there O
are O
more O

fifty O

these O

as O
they O
are O
there O
illegally O
without O

of O
the O
Authorities O

Should O
the O

be O
informed O
of O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
they O
will O
be O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
Austrian B-LOC

the O
tragedy O
of O
persecution B-TER
will O
start O
again O

Another O

the O

One O

Their O

We O
very O

the O
negative O
result O

the O
whole O

who O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
no O
other O
way O
to O
solve O
this O
question O
except O
by O
the O
plan O
proposed O

The O
families B-TER
with O
many O
children B-TER
can O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
Argentine B-LOC
as O
First O

as O
the O
expense O
would O
be O
ar O
too O
great O
, O
for O
each O

11,500 O
Crowns O
, O
a O
family B-TER
of O
six O
persons O
costing O
about O
Five O
hundred O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
people B-TER
on O

is O
worse O
than O
anyone O
can O
imagine O

can O

also O
from O
what O
Mrs. O

saw O
when O
she O
visited O
them O
on O

and O
therefore O
, O
under O
the O
cirumstances O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
can O
not O
accept O
sole O
responsibility O
for O
these O
poor O
people B-TER

must O
pass O
some O
on O
to O
the O
shoulders O

of O
the O
Hicem B-ORG

tragic O
position O

the O

The O
Committee O

carefully O
considered O
the O
matter O

but O
could O
not O
accept O
the O

made O
to O
them O
that O
they O
should O
contribute O
£ O
4,000 O
for O
the O
rescue O
of O
four O

This O
is O
far O
in O
excess O
of O
any O
grant O
that O
has O
been O
previously O
made O
, O
and O
we O
felt O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
justified O

in O

of O
the O
many O

During O

after O
a O
30 O

they O
were O
taken O
back O

At O

a O

No O

the O
Hungarian B-LOC

hoping O
that O
the O
Jewish B-TER

It O
is O
now O
three O
months O
that O
these O
people O
, O
smitten O
with O
despair O
, O
refused O
by O
every O
country O
, O
and O
even O
grudged O
the O
stay O
aboard O
the O
ship O
– O
it O
is O
now O
three O
months O
that O
they O
are O
thus O
kept O
in O
the O
vague O
hope O
of O
salvation O

Efforts O
were O
made O
to O
induce O
various O
countries O

these O
unfortunates O

Though O
some O
of O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O

managed O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
United B-LOC

the O

It O
was O
in O

that O
we O
went O
to O

the O
refugees B-TER

the O

on O
July O

We O
have O
seen O
their O
unspeakable O
mental O
distress O
, O
even O
increased O
by O
physical O
torture O
, O
as O
they O
either O
must O
stay O
in O
the O
narrow O
rooms O
downstairs O
which O
are O
infested O
with O
rats O

vermin O

or O
on O
the O

they O
are O
left O
to O
the O

There O
must O
be O
an O
end O
to O
this O
awful O
tragedy O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
that O
Jewry B-TER

suffer O
all O
the O
humiliation O
that O
is O
