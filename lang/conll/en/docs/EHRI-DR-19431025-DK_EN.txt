The O
precautions B-TER
taken O

directed O
mainly O
towards O
Full B-TER

Full O
Jews O
are O
understood O
as O
persons O

in O
a O

a O
non O
- O
Jew O

Exceptions O
to O

both O
so O
that O
some O
Half B-TER
- I-TER
Jews I-TER

half O

in O
Grini B-LOC

these O

not O

because O
of O
their O

, O
but O
because O

been O
raised O
against O

. O

Jews B-TER
