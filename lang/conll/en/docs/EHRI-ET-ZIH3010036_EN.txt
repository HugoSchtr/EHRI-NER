400 O
more O

The O

The O

It O

During O
the O

, O
some O
of O
the O

On O

the O

Kommissar O

In O
the O
square O
of O
Wieliczka B-LOC
, O
[ O
we O

had O
to O
stand O
in O
groups O
of O
a O
hundred O
people O
, O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

[ O
We O
] O
stood O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
under O
the O
burning O
sun O
and O
then O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
told O
to O
sit O
on O
the O

. O

[ O
We O
were O
] O
guarded O
by O
a O
company O

After O

300 O
more O
were O
chosen O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Płaszów B-LOC
- O
Krakow B-LOC
cable O
factory B-TER
. O

Then O
the O
women B-TER
and O
the O
children B-TER
were O
driven O
, O
murderously O
beaten O
and O
driven O
into O
railway O
carriages O
, O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Belzec B-LOC
. O

The O
sight O
[ O
was O
] O
a O
horrible O
one O
. O

Wails O
, O
crying O
and O
shouting O
of O
around O
600 O
people O
was O
so O
frightful O
, O
that O
it O
was O
heard O
from O
a O
distance O
of O
a O
few O
kilometers O
. O

The O
backpacks O
[ O
… O
] O
When O
everyone O
was O
already O
standing O
, O
the O
Sturmmann B-TER
took O
out O
his O
revolver O
and O
started O
to O
shoot O
at O
the O
crowd O
– O
supposedly O
at O
the O
sick B-TER
– O
but O
in O
reality O
[ O
he O
] O
shot B-TER
more O
healthy O
than O
sick B-TER
men B-TER
. O

The O
wounded O
ones O
were O
wrangling O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
pain O
and O
agony O
– O
the O
Sturmmann B-TER
stood O
and O
looked O
at O
them O
with O
a O
sarcastic O
and O
sadistic O
joy O
and O
had O
pleasure O
. O

Most O
of O
[ O
people O
] O
asked O
him O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
so O
much O
awful O
pain O
. O

[ O
He O
] O
noticed O
that O
I O
looked O
very O
frightened O
, O
[ O
so O
he O
] O
ordered O
me O
to O
occupy O
myself O
with O
carrying O
away O
the O
wounded O
. O

Blood O
was O
dripping O
from O
their O
faces O
, O
[ O
so O
he O
] O
ordered O
me O
to O
cover O
the O
blood O
streams O
with O
sand O
. O

They O
were O
buried B-TER
alive I-TER
. O

The O
ground O
was O
rising O
from O
the O
people O
buried B-TER
alive I-TER
. O

Often O
[ O
there O
was O
] O
an O
upper O
layer O
of O
blood O
that O
had O
seeped O
through O
from O
the O
buried B-TER
ones O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
hard O
labour B-TER
, O
we O
prayed O
every O
morning O
we O
would O
be O
brought O
to O
work B-TER
in O
order O
not O
to O
see O
the O
sad O
scenes O
. O

[ O
When O
we O
would O
] O
go O
out O
through O
the O
gate O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
Jewish O
order O
service O
, O
Dr O
Libeskin B-PER
from O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
would O
stand O
and O
count O
[ O
us O
] O
and O
wished O
us O
in O
Polish O
: O
Wracajcie O
, O
chłopcy O
. O

He O
would O
not O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
beaten O
, O
pushed O
, O
shoved O
, O
told O
to O
run O
, O
shot O
at O
etc O
. O

If O
someone O
fell O
or O
became O
a O
little O
tired O
– O
he O
was O
shot B-TER
immediately O
. O

There O
were O
victims B-TER
every O
day O
. O

When O
[ O
we O
] O
came O
to O
the O
place O
of O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
were O
were O
] O
counted O
again O
. O

Because O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
[ O
were O
] O
poor O
mathematicians O
, O
the O
numbers O
never O
matched O
for O
them O
. O

Sometimes O
too O
few O
, O
sometimes O
too O
many O
. O

The O
counting O
would O
take O
hours O
. O

During O
it O
[ O
they O
] O
beat O
us O
savagely O
. O

There O
was O
a O
Polish B-TER
overseer B-TER
at O
work O
, O
registered O
as O
a O
Volksdeutsch O
, O
he O
took O
revenge O
on O
us O
, O
cursed O
us O
, O
hit O
, O
swore O
, O
robbed O
us O
of O
our O
belongings O
etc O
. O

He O
would O
force O
the O
Jews O
, O
for O
example O
, O
to O
push O
a O
railway O
car O
of O
30 O
tons O
. O

Żydzie O
, O
what O
are O
these O
shoes O
good O
for O
you O
, O
you O
will O
be O
shot O
in O
any O
case O
! O
! O
! O
We O
worked B-TER
at O
least O
10 O
- O
12 O
hours O
. O

Together O
with O
the O
counting O
and O
the O
walking O
to O
work B-TER
and O
back O
for O
8 O
kilometers O
, O
a O
working B-TER
day O
was O
about O
18 O
hours O
long O
. O

12 O
o’clock O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
lunch B-TER
hour O
. O

We O
, O
the O
Jewish O
pigs O
, O
were O
brought O
some O
water O
with O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
bread B-TER
that O
we O
had O
to O
drink O
standing O
. O

[ O
We O
would O
] O
often O
run O
to O
the O
free O
Polish B-TER
workers O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
who O
received O
good O
food B-TER
and O
lived O
as O
free O
people O
in O
relatively O
good O
conditions B-TER
, O
and O
asked O
them O
for O
food B-TER
scraps I-TER
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
or O
could O
not O
eat B-TER
, O
for O
example O
, O
stale O
pieces O
of O
bread B-TER
etc O
. O

But O
the O
Poles B-TER
would O
rather O
throw O
it O
to O
the O
rubbish O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
it O
to O
the O
poor O
Jews O
. O

The O
cooks O
did O
the O
same O
with O
the O
leftovers O
and O
food B-TER
scraped I-TER
from O
the O
cauldrons O
. O

As O
we O
were O
returning O
from O
the O
bath O
in O
Rozwadów B-LOC
, O
the O
Hauptmann O
told O
to O
one O
of O
us O
: O
Oh O
, O
dreckige O
Jude O
, O
you O
still O
have O
shitty O
eyes O
, O
and O
shot B-TER
him O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
. O

Once O
when O
we O
were O
being O
marched O
to O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
they O
] O
had O
an O
idea O
that O
we O
should O
not O
run O
, O
but O
go O
slowly O
, O
and O
[ O
they O
] O
told O
us O
to O
sing O
. O

Nobody O
sang O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
started O
to O
beat O
us O
and O
shoot O
at O
us O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
started O
to O
sing O
. O

What O
a O
pity O
that O
singing O
was O
! O
More O
like O
wailing O
than O
singing O
. O

Polish B-TER
women B-TER
that O
were O
passing O
by O
shouted O
: O
Zobaczcie O
jak O
dobrze O
się O
powodzi O
tym O
Żydkom O
– O
s[kurwy]syny O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-TER
spoke O
Russian B-TER
as O
a O
provocation O
, O
told O
that O
they O
were O
from O
Leningrad B-LOC
etc O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
started O
to O
allow O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
during O
the O
night O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
cold B-TER
we O
had O
to O
go O
twenty O
times O
a O
night O
. O

But O
no O
one O
came O
back O
. O

They O
were O
shot B-TER
going O
there O
or O
coming O
back O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
Scheisse O
to O
me O
, O
I O
get O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
for O
six O
groszy O
! O
( O
He O
wrote O
a O
postcard O
that O
cost O
6 O
groszy O
to O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
and O
received O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
. O

) O
That O
’s O
how O
Schwammberger B-PER
boasted O
loudly O
. O

Schwammberger B-PER
personally O
shot B-TER
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
, O
the O
rabbi B-TER
of O
Wieliczka B-LOC
, O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
closing O
prayer B-TER
, O
in O
1942 O
. O

Before O
shooting B-TER
[ O
him O
] O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
held O
the O
following O
speech O
to O
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
: O
Herr O
Oberrabiner O
! O
I O
decided O
to O
shoot O
you O
for O
sabotage O
! O
The O
sabotage B-TER
was O
the O
fact O
that O
rabbi B-TER
Frenkel B-PER
had O
had O
to O
empty O
a O
cart O
of O
coals O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
. O

Because O
he O
did O
it O
using O
his O
hands O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
used O
it O
as O
a O
pretext O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
sabotage O
. O

When O
he O
was O
coming O
back O
from O
work B-TER
, O
after O
having O
fasted O
, O
done O
heavy B-TER
work I-TER
, O
suffered O
beating O
etc O
. O

the O
whole O
day O
, O
Schwammberger B-PER
shot B-TER
him O
in O
public O
. O

But O
a O
pit O
for O
him O
had O
already O
been O
dug O
and O
waiting O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
. O

It O
means O
that O
Schwammberger B-PER
had O
been O
preparing O
for O
the O
joyous O
spectacle O
: O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
and O
a O
rabbi B-TER
! O
The O
Gestapo B-ORG
agent O
Nowak B-PER
boasted O
in O
front O
of O
us O
: O
I O
have O
already O
dealt O
with O
1893 O
Jews O
and O
shot O
them O
as O
dogs O
! O
An O
elderly O
Jew O
reported O
: O
I O
have O
a O
swollen O
foot O
. O

It O
hurts O
! O
Oh O
, O
you O
poor O
one O
, O
your O
foot O
hurts O
? O
Zeig O
mal O
! O
The O
Jew O
showed O
it O
slowly O
. O

And O
the O
Nazi O
slowly O
stepped O
on O
the O
ailing O
foot O
and O
crushed O
it O
so O
long O
that O
the O
Jew O
almost O
lost O
consciousness O
– O
and O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
him O
. O

Wola I-LOC
( O
after O
Rozwadów B-LOC
) O
in O
the O
territory O
where O
we O
worked B-TER
every O
inch O
of O
the O
ground O
was O
a O
tomb O
. O

Before O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
evacuated B-TER
all O
the O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
so O
that O
they O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
happened O
there O
. O

The O
territory O
was O
covered O
with O
tents O
, O
[ O
they O
] O
walked O
around O
with O
gas B-TER
masks O
, O
looked O
for O
money O
and O
things O
on O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
buried B-TER
Jews O
and O
then O
poured O
liquid O
in O
the O
territory O
to O
burn O
the O
traces O
of O
cadavers B-TER
. O

Although O
the O
lunch B-TER
did O
not O
last O
longer O
than O
10 O
minutes O
, O
it O
meant O
that O
it O
was O
taking O
too O
long O
, O
and O
[ O
we O
] O
got O
beaten O
for O
that O
again O
. O

Going O
back O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
were O
counted O
again O
. O

The O
counting O
would O
go O
until O
late O
at O
night O
because O
the O
numbers O
would O
never O
match O
; O
[ O
we O
were O
] O
beaten O
again O
because O
of O
it O
. O

Everyone O
was O
searched O
if O
we O
had O
n’t O
taken O
something O
with O
us O
. O

At O
work B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
would O
eat B-TER
uncooked O
potatoes B-TER
. O

We O
would O
get O
bloody O
diarrhea B-TER
, O
twisted B-TER
bowels I-TER
etc O
. O

[ O
We O
were O
] O
not O
even O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
. O

[ O
When O
] O
someone O
would O
get O
sick B-TER
, O
[ O
he O
] O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

[ O
We O
would O
] O
go O
back O
in O
groups O
of O
five O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
warned O
[ O
us O
] O
that O
if O
someone O
would O
escape B-TER
, O
all O
[ O
the O
others O
would O
] O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
that O
, O
friendly O
groups O
of O
five O
have O
formed O
. O

Coming O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
[ O
we O
] O
had O
to O
march O
in O
in O
a O
hard O
- O
beating O
military B-TER
parade O
tempo O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
[ O
they O
] O
would O
start O
to O
count O
again O
for O
hours O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
all O
were O
tired O
, O
exhausted O
, O
wet O
, O
… O
, O
hungry B-TER
, O
beaten O
, O
sleepy O
. O

[ O
Then O
] O
again O
in O
lines O
for O
the O
supper B-TER
, O
water O
with O
dirty O
polluted O
cabbage B-TER
leaves I-TER
, O
that O
were O
given O
to O
eat O
to O
the O
Jewish O
pigs O
. O

One O
and O
a O
half O
hour O
in O
the O
line O
, O
getting O
beaten O
, O
pushed O
again O
and O
people O
would O
collapse O
all O
the O
time O
, O
victims B-TER
of O
the O
supper B-TER
queues O
. O

Finally O
, O
at O
11 O
PM O
[ O
we O
] O
would O
lie O
down O
on O
hard O
, O
dirty O
, O
humid O
, O
rotten O
boards O
. O

We O
went O
to O
a O
bath O
there O
one O
and O
only O
time O
. O

What O
a O
bath O
, O
we O
were O
awfully O
afraid O
, O
because O
there O
were O
deaths O
there O
. O

Coming O
back O
to O
the O
beds O
, O
we O
saw O
that O
all O
our O
belongings O
that O
[ O
we O
had O
] O
left O
were O
stolen O
, O
taken O
away O
. O

During O
the O
night O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
could O
not O
sleep O
because O
of O
the O
moans O
and O
cries O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
. O

Jews O
, O
help O
! O
, O
they O
shouted O
. O

Rascals O
wound O
count O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
shout O
: O
They O
( O
the O
sick O
) O
should O
be O
shot O
! O
We O
[ O
all O
] O
will O
be O
shot O
tomorrow O
, O
so O
what O
’s O
the O
difference O
, O
a O
day O
earlier O
or O
a O
day O
later O
! O
[ O
They O
] O
would O
stand O
outside O
and O
shoot B-TER
people O
. O

Sometimes O
during O
the O
sleep O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
men B-TER
would O
enter O
the O
barracks O
and O
shoot B-TER
at O
anyone O
that O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
sight O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
suffered O
thus O
until O
the O
15th O
of O
November O
1942 O
. O

On O
that O
day O
, O
250 O
from O
the O
remaining O
600 O
men B-TER
were O
selected B-TER
and O
sent O
away O
to O
the O
steel O
factory B-TER
in O
Stalowa B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
we O
were O
driven O
back O
with O
SS B-TER
guards B-TER
to O
Rozwadów B-LOC
to O
dig O
a O
grave B-TER
for O
all O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
. O

About O
30 O
persons O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
[ O
were O
] O
so O
bad O
, O
that O
soon O
60 O
[ O
of O
us O
] O
were O
unable O
to O
work B-TER
. O

All O
the O
time O
in O
sick B-TER
condition O
. O

90 O
persons O
from O
Przemyśl B-LOC
were O
brought O
in O
, O
all O
professional O
metalworkers O
. O

They O
all O
worked B-TER
in O
a O
canon O
factory B-TER
. O

Already O
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
a O
few O
were O
shot B-TER
because O
of O
communism O
and O
illness O
. O

In O
March O
, O
56 O
from O
the O
60 O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

Although O
more O
than O
30 O
from O
the O
60 O
had O
already O
died B-TER
themselves O
, O
Gestapo B-ORG
took O
accidental O
healthy O
ones O
and O
rounded O
the O
number O
to O
60 O
with O
them O
. O

( O
60 O
means O
60 O
! O
) O
The O
commander O
of O
the O
Polish B-TER
Baudienst O
, O
Fischer B-PER
, O
made O
his O
debut O
in O
this O
round B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
( O
free O
workers O
, O
Polish B-TER
junacy O
, O
[ O
they O
] O
lived O
near O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
would O
often O
go O
away O
for O
vacations O
etc O
. O

) O
. O

From O
then O
on O
, O
the O
work B-TER
would O
often O
take O
even O
24 O
hours O
. O

[ O
He O
would O
] O
command O
: O
Sondereinsatz O
( O
a O
special O
, O
extraordinary O
task O
) O
. O

Many O
Jews O
lost O
their O
lives O
during O
the O
Sondereinsätze O
. O

Not O
one O
begged O
: O
Shoot O
me O
! O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
strength O
to O
the O
Sondereinsatz O
anymore O
! O
This O
week O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
did O
this O
work O
four O
times O
already O
. O

It O
means O
, O
[ O
we O
worked B-TER
] O
for O
24 O
hours O
without O
a O
pause O
, O
normally O
12 O
- O
18 O
hours O
. O

That O
means O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
worked B-TER
for O
36 O
and O
for O
48 O
hours O
without O
sleeping O
and O
without O
eating B-TER
. O

During O
the O
rest O
time O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
cleaned O
toilets O
, O
carried O
water O
, O
chopped O
wood O
, O
cleaned O
floors O
, O
dug O
graved O
– O
and O
doing O
it O
[ O
we O
had O
] O
to O
hurry O
like O
mad O
, O
took O
blows O
, O
were O
shot O
at O
, O
and O
we O
would O
collapse O
while O
working B-TER
. O

In O
November O
1943 O
, O
the O
SD B-ORG
in O
green O
uniforms O
came O
. O

Their O
arrival O
meant O
the O
liquidation O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

It O
was O
their O
mission O
. O

They O
travelled O
from O
camp B-TER
to O
camp B-TER
and O
liquidated O
them O
. O

Liquidation O
meant O
: O
Shoot O
out O
the O
Jews O
! O
. O

The O
director O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
Scholtze B-PER
, O
a O
major O
in O
SS B-TER
( O
but O
he O
) O
opposed O
them O
with O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
Jews O
are O
needed O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
( O
thanks O
to O
him O
, O
many O
Jews O
were O
saved O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
) O
. O

Jews O
are O
qualified O
workers B-TER
and O
without O
them O
the O
factory B-TER
would O
be O
forced O
to O
close O
. O

270 O
Jewish O
workers B-TER
from O
more O
than O
8 O
thousand O
Polish B-TER
ones O
! O
An O
intervention O
was O
made O
in O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
and O
after O
two O
weeks O
they O
[ O
the O
SD B-ORG
] O
left O
to O
Rzeszów B-LOC
. O

On O
a O
tour O
. O

In O
Rzeszów B-LOC
and O
in O
Przemyśl B-LOC
they O
liquidated O
the O
ghettos B-TER
, O
leaving O
the O
Ausräumung O
- O
Kolonnen O
( O
to O
sort O
, O
pack O
and O
send O
to O
Germany B-TER
the O
Jewish O
possessions O
) O
. O

Such O
columns O
comprised O
around O
300 O
persons O
. O

When O
the O
job B-TER
was O
done O
, O
around O
50 O
would O
still O
remain O
, O
and O
they O
would O
also O
be O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
end O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Ausräumung O
- O
Kolonnen O
from O
Rzeszów B-LOC
and O
Przemyśl B-LOC
had O
luck O
, O
they O
were O
left O
alive O
and O
brought O
to O
Stalowa B-LOC
Wola I-LOC
to O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
because O
the O
factory B-TER
needed O
workforce B-TER
and O
since O
a O
year O
had O
been O
continuously O
demanding O
some O
Jews O
for O
work B-TER
. O

In O
1944 O
, O
the O
Soviets B-TER
bombed O
the O
factories B-TER
. O

A O
bomb O
hit O
the O
factory B-TER
and O
killed B-TER
3 O
Jews O
and O
3 O
Poles B-TER
. O

Our O
joy O
[ O
was O
] O
great O
, O
[ O
we O
] O
meant O
as O
the O
Soviets B-TER
were O
coming O
very O
soon O
and O
that O
we O
would O
be O
saved O
. O

Because O
some O
of O
the O
bombs O
had O
n’t O
exploded O
, O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
dig O
out O
the O
bombs O
and O
detonate O
them O
. O

German B-TER
officers O
gave O
the O
Jews O
precise O
instructions O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
bombs O
and O
themselves O
went O
away O
to O
observe O
[ O
from O
a O
distance O
] O
if O
the O
Jews O
were O
following O
the O
instructions O
to O
the O
letter O
. O

For O
two O
years O
, O
we O
had O
been O
planning O
an O
escape B-TER
all O
the O
time O
, O
we O
only O
waited O
for O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

One O
time O
at O
night O
the O
commander O
posted O
about O
30 O
Jews O
from O
his O
people O
along O
the O
fence O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
escapes B-TER
. O

Nobody O
knew O
what O
happened O
. O

Suddenly O
a O
commotion O
at O
night O
: O
these O
guards B-TER
had O
dug O
a O
tunnel O
under O
the O
fence O
, O
even O
under O
the O
electric O
wires O
, O
and O
escaped B-TER
. O

Because O
some O
Ukrainians B-TER
also O
stood O
guard B-TER
, O
the O
Jews O
organized O
everything O
so O
that O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
stood O
guard B-TER
all O
together O
somewhere O
else O
and O
the O
Jewish O
guard B-TER
all O
together O
[ O
elsewhere O
] O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
they O
escaped B-TER
. O

Hearing O
the O
story O
, O
no O
one O
knew O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-TER
did O
not O
know O
how O
[ O
the O
escape B-TER
happened O
] O
, O
but O
we O
knew O
how O
– O
[ O
I O
] O
went O
out O
in O
the O
darkness O
with O
a O
few O
more O
Jews O
and O
we O
tried O
to O
look O
for O
the O
tunnel O
. O

We O
found O
[ O
it O
] O
. O

[ O
We O
] O
, O
a O
few O
men B-TER
, O
pushed O
ourselves O
through O
and O
ran O
in O
the O
darkness O
. O

The O
Jewish O
commander O
wanted O
to O
denounce B-TER
me O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
strangle B-TER
him O
, O
threw O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
ran O
away O
. O

Hearing O
his O
shouts O
, O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
started O
to O
shoot O
, O
soon O
the O
whole O
guard B-TER
unit O
of O
80 O
Nazis O
arrived O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
shooting O
, O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
which O
was O
fenced O
with O
barbed O
wires O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
territory O
. O

The O
Nazi O
guards B-TER
that O
had O
arrived O
running O
, O
surrounded O
me O
and O
two O
others O
and O
shouted O
: O
Hands O
up O
! O
Seeing O
that O
I O
was O
in O
a O
trap O
, O
I O
ran O
to O
a O
pile O
of O
old O
metal O
and O
hid O
myself O
. O

The O
Nazi O
guards B-TER
had O
n’t O
understood O
what O
was O
happening O
yet O
. O

[ O
They O
] O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
a O
landing O
operation O
. O

They O
had O
n’t O
even O
thought O
that O
some O
Jews O
had O
escaped B-TER
. O

Seeing O
that O
it O
was O
only O
me O
who O
had O
disappeared O
, O
they O
started O
to O
hunt O
the O
two O
others O
. O

They O
actually O
managed O
to O
catch O
them O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
them O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
seen O
them O
since O
. O

They O
spent O
half O
a O
day O
looking O
for O
me O
in O
the O
piles O
of O
metal O
but O
did O
not O
find O
[ O
me O
] O
. O

One O
Nazi O
was O
searching O
not O
far O
from O
me O
, O
I O
hit O
him O
on O
the O
head O
from O
behind O
with O
a O
metal O
rod O
and O
killed B-TER
him O
. O

The O
rest O
looked O
for O
him O
, O
but O
could O
not O
find O
[ O
him O
] O
. O

I O
covered O
him O
with O
pieces O
of O
metal O
. O

I O
spent O
eight O
days O
there O
, O
hidden O
, O
without O
food B-TER
, O
without O
water O
, O
without O
air O
. O

I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
there O
because O
the O
place O
was O
guarded B-TER
by O
Germans B-TER
day O
and O
night O
. O

I O
was O
sure O
I O
would O
never O
get O
out O
of O
there O
, O
I O
would O
die B-TER
. O

Under O
dim O
rays O
of O
light O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
note O
my O
feelings O
and O
descriptions O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Firstly O
, O
in O
order O
to O
fight O
against O
the O
boredom O
, O
the O
duration O
, O
the O
nervousness O
. O

Secondly O
, O
to O
leave O
a O
trace O
for O
the O
future O
in O
case O
someone O
would O
find O
it O
. O

( O
I O
have O
the O
memoirs O
in O
my O
possession O
. O

) O
[ O
There O
were O
] O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
metal O
pieces O
there O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
tracker O
dogs O
could O
not O
find O
me O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
metal O
also O
masks O
the O
traces O
[ O
of O
smell O
] O
. O

( O
A O
body O
of O
a O
car O
hid O
me O
. O

) O
I O
had O
a O
knife O
with O
me O
and O
a O
metal O
rod O
always O
ready O
to O
kill B-TER
any O
Nazi O
that O
would O
try O
to O
arrest B-TER
me O
. O
