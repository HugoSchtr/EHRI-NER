of O
her O
brother B-TER
, O
Dr O
Alfred B-PER
Meyer I-PER
of O
Barmen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Düsseldorf I-LOC
, O
on O
16 O
May O
1933 O
I O
, O
the O
undersigned O
Erna B-PER
Meyer I-PER
hereby O
swear O
by O
this O
affidavit O
that O
the O
following O
statement O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

I O
am O
fully O
aware O
that O
this O
statement O
is O
to O
be O
used O
by O
a O
Swiss B-LOC
law B-TER
court I-TER
and O
I O
am O
aware O
that O
those O
who O
swear O
a O
false O
affidavit O
, O
either O
deliberately O
or O
inadvertently O
, O
are O
subject O
to O
severe O
penalties O
under O
the O
criminal B-TER
law I-TER
of O
all O
countries O
including O
Switzerland B-LOC
and O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
and O
of O
course O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
morality O
which O
requires O
me O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
and O
nothing O
but O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
have O
considered O
every O
word O
that O
I O
have O
written O
and O
fully O
guarantee O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
affidavit O
. O

I O
had O
a O
brother B-TER
, O
Dr O
Alfred B-PER
Meyer I-PER
, O
who O
was O
born O
on O
24 O
March O
1898 O
. O

He O
left O
grammar O
school B-TER
even O
before O
the O
age O
of O
seventeen O
to O
join O
the O
army B-TER
as O
a O
volunteer O
; O
in O
February O
1915 O
he O
marched O
into O
battle B-TER
and O
was O
a O
soldier B-TER
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

He O
was O
wounded B-TER
no O
less O
than O
three O
times O
but O
nevertheless O
went O
back O
to O
the O
battlefield B-TER
each O
time O
, O
was O
awarded O
the O
Bayrische O
Verdienstkreuz O
and O
the O
Iron B-TER
Cross I-TER
Second I-TER
Class I-TER
, O
and O
was O
promoted O
to O
Vizewachtmeister O
. O

On O
returning O
from O
the O
war B-TER
he O
completed O
his O
education B-TER
, O
first O
at O
school B-TER
where O
he O
passed O
the O
Abitur B-TER
; O
he O
then O
studied O
dentistry B-TER
and O
set O
up O
in O
practice O
as O
a O
dentist B-TER
in O
Wuppertal B-LOC
- I-LOC
Barmen I-LOC
. O

He O
had O
never O
been O
active O
politically B-TER
, O
either O
before O
or O
after O
this O
; O
in O
particular O
, O
he O
had O
never O
been O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Socialist B-TER
or O
Communist B-TER
Parties I-TER
, O
nor O
had O
he O
ever O
done O
anything O
for O
any O
of O
these O
parties B-TER
. O

Even O
before O
the O
revolution O
of O
1933 O
he O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
antipathy O
towards O
him O
in O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
circles O
in O
Barmen B-LOC
; O
he O
attributed O
this O
to O
the O
fact O
not O
only O
that O
he O
was O
a O
Jew O
, O
but O
also O
that O
one O
of O
the O
leading O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
of O
Barmen B-LOC
, O
a O
dentist B-TER
named O
Viering B-PER
, O
had O
had O
his O
practice O
opposite O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
as O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
very O
popular O
with O
his O
patients O
he O
Viering B-PER
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
a O
practice O
. O

This O
Viering B-PER
had O
been O
sued O
for O
libel O
even O
before O
the O
revolution O
of O
1933 O
because O
he O
had O
stated O
that O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
suffering O
from O
a O
sexually B-TER
transmitted I-TER
disease I-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
underwent O
a O
very O
thorough O
examination O
proving O
that O
this O
accusation O
was O
completely O
false O
. O

Consequently O
, O
Viering B-PER
was O
punished O
. O

Viering B-PER
tried O
another O
libel O
, O
saying O
that O
my O
brother B-TER
, O
in O
his O
capacity O
as O
a O
certifying O
doctor B-TER
, O
had O
produced O
false O
certificates O
for O
patients O
to O
claim O
on O
national O
health B-TER
insurance B-TER
. O

Again O
, O
this O
accusation O
was O
proved O
to O
be O
unfounded O
after O
the O
dentists B-TER
’ I-TER
professional O
body O
had O
thoroughly O
examined O
the O
case O
and O
found O
my O
brother B-TER
to O
be O
blameless O
. O

After O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
revolution O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
house B-TER
was O
immediately O
searched B-TER
but O
nothing O
was O
found O
which O
might O
be O
used O
against O
him O
in O
some O
way O
. O

These O
searches O
were O
mainly O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
following O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
: O
Fischer B-PER
, O
Viering B-PER
, O
Birkenstock B-PER
and O
Noelle B-PER
. O

These O
searches B-TER
took O
place O
at O
a O
time O
when O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
travelling O
abroad O
trying O
to O
discover O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
possibility O
for O
him O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
then O
returned O
and O
even O
went O
back O
to O
Barmen B-LOC
despite O
several O
warnings O
, O
because O
he O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
he O
was O
an O
honest O
and O
upright O
man B-TER
, O
and O
that O
running O
away O
would O
be O
the O
action O
of O
a O
coward O
. O

Whilst O
he O
was O
in O
Barmen B-LOC
he O
felt O
so O
persecuted B-TER
that O
one O
night O
he O
did O
not O
sleep O
at O
home B-TER
but O
instead O
at O
a O
friend O
’s O
. O

During O
the O
night O
his O
house B-TER
was O
searched B-TER
again O
. O

This O
search B-TER
was O
conducted O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
damage O
to O
the O
property B-TER
was O
clearly O
intended O
. O

The O
next O
day O
my O
brother B-TER
went O
to O
the O
police B-TER
and O
asked O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
so O
- O
called O
voluntary O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
because O
he O
feared B-TER
for O
his O
life O
. O

The O
police B-TER
did O
as O
he O
asked O
and O
so O
he O
spent O
the O
time O
from O
the O
end O
of O
March O
until O
10 O
May O
in O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
. O

I O
must O
state O
, O
however O
, O
that O
his O
voluntary O
stay O
in O
protective B-TER
custody I-TER
became O
involuntary O
during O
this O
time O
because O
an O
investigation B-TER
was O
started O
against O
him O
, O
for O
political B-TER
reasons O
. O

This O
investigation B-TER
was O
extremely O
hard O
for O
him O
, O
mainly O
because O
he O
tried O
desperately O
for O
five O
weeks O
to O
have O
his O
first O
interrogation B-TER
, O
which O
in O
the O
end O
was O
only O
brought O
about O
by O
friends O
, O
including O
non O
- O
Jewish O
friends O
, O
who O
finally O
convinced O
the O
authorities O
to O
carry O
out O
an O
interrogation B-TER
. O

The O
investigation B-TER
did O
not O
bring O
anything O
to O
light O
since O
, O
as O
already O
mentioned O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
that O
could O
come O
to O
light O
, O
and O
so O
he O
was O
released B-TER
on O
10 O
May O
1933 O
. O

In O
the O
night O
after O
his O
release B-TER
his O
house B-TER
was O
searched B-TER
again O
; O
he O
was O
not O
at O
home B-TER
because O
he O
had O
preferred O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
at O
the O
house B-TER
of O
a O
Christian B-TER
family B-TER
he O
was O
friendly O
with O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
his O
flat B-TER
was O
devastated O
, O
all O
kinds O
of O
valuables O
like O
record O
players O
and O
records O
were O
destroyed B-TER
, O
carpets O
were O
slashed O
, O
lamps O
were O
broken O
, O
the O
fully O
fitted O
kitchen O
was O
torn O
out O
. O

Many O
valuable O
goods O
were O
stolen O
, O
and O
they O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
take O
away O
his O
suits B-TER
and O
shoes B-TER
. O

After O
this O
occurrence O
my O
brother B-TER
preferred O
to O
leave O
Barmen B-LOC
and O
after O
spending O
some O
days O
somewhere O
else O
he O
started O
work B-TER
as O
a O
dentist B-TER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
whilst O
preparing O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

His O
wife B-TER
, O
also O
a O
dentist B-TER
, O
had O
a O
practice O
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
and O
the O
two O
decided O
to O
stand O
in O
for O
each O
other O
until O
they O
could O
emigrate B-TER
, O
as O
having O
only O
a O
little O
money B-TER
they O
could O
not O
do O
without O
an O
income O
. O

On O
16 O
May O
the O
telephone O
rang O
in O
his O
practice O
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
Noelle B-PER
– O
already O
mentioned O
above O
– O
who O
asked O
whether O
my O
brother B-TER
was O
there O
and O
when O
the O
answer O
was O
yes O
he O
said O
, O
that O
s O
all O
I O
want O
to O
know O
’ O
and O
rang O
off O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
he O
rang O
again O
and O
soon O
after O
the O
call O
my O
brother B-TER
left O
the O
practice O
and O
went O
to O
a O
family B-TER
he O
was O
friendly O
with O
. O

In O
the O
street O
he O
was O
followed O
and O
soon O
after O
he O
had O
arrived O
a O
car O
stopped O
in O
which O
there O
were O
five O
people B-TER
, O
among O
them O
the O
four O
mentioned O
above O
, O
who O
had O
taken O
part O
in O
the O
previous O
searches B-TER
. O

Viering B-PER
stayed O
at O
the O
wheel O
, O
the O
four O
others O
went O
into O
the O
flat B-TER
, O
threw O
my O
brother B-TER
onto O
the O
floor O
, O
tied O
him O
up O
and O
dragged O
him O
into O
the O
car O
. O

The O
other O
people B-TER
present O
were O
also O
tied O
up O
, O
and O
as O
one O
of O
them O
had O
tried O
to O
get O
to O
the O
telephone O
to O
call O
for O
help O
before O
being O
tied O
up O
, O
the O
telephone O
was O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
any O
communication O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
impossible O
. O

The O
registration B-TER
number O
had O
been O
noted O
by O
several O
people B-TER
but O
the O
investigation B-TER
showed O
that O
it O
was O
false O
. O

The O
help O
the O
police B-TER
gave O
us O
was O
just O
a O
formality O
with O
no O
practical O
and O
effective O
support O
at O
all O
, O
and O
so O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
discover O
his O
whereabouts O
. O

At O
first O
we O
had O
engaged O
the O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
lawyer B-TER
KINTZEN B-PER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
; O
he O
, O
however O
, O
later O
terminated O
the O
brief O
because O
the O
Party B-TER
had O
advised O
him O
not O
to O
engage O
in O
this O
case O
– O
a O
fact O
we O
do O
know O
for O
certain O
. O

Some O
days O
after O
my O
brother B-TER
had O
disappeared O
a O
forester O
informed O
[ O
us O
] O
that O
at O
the O
Bewerdam O
, O
between O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
and O
Barmen B-LOC
, O
the O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
of O
a O
man B-TER
had O
been O
washed O
up O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
my O
brother B-TER
’s I-TER
corpse B-TER
, O
which O
had O
been O
thrown O
into O
the O
water O
; O
his O
head O
had O
been O
stuck O
into O
a O
sack O
and O
his O
feet O
tied O
to O
a O
copy O
machine O
to O
prevent O
the O
body B-TER
from O
surfacing O
. O

There O
must O
have O
been O
very O
particular O
circumstances O
which O
allowed O
the O
body B-TER
to O
come O
up O
again O
nevertheless O
. O

We O
ourselves O
did O
not O
get O
the O
body B-TER
– O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
was O
handed O
over O
several O
days O
later O
to O
the O
chief O
rabbi B-TER
in O
Düsseldorf B-LOC
who O
in O
exchange O
had O
strict O
orders O
not O
to O
show O
his O
corpse B-TER
to O
his O
relatives O
. O

Later O
we O
learnt O
– O
not O
from O
the O
rabbi B-TER
but O
from O
others O
who O
had O
seen O
the O
corpse B-TER
– O
that O
he O
had O
been O
stabbed B-TER
in O
the O
abdomen B-TER
and O
other O
parts O
of O
his O
body O
; O
he O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
head O
twice O
and O
his O
body B-TER
had O
been O
maltreated O
and O
mutilated O
in O
a O
disgusting O
way O
. O

The O
court B-TER
refused O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
case O
, O
so O
the O
records O
were O
sent O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
but O
are O
said O
to O
have O
been O
lost O
in O
transit O
. O

By O
order O
of O
the O
authorities O
the O
funeral B-TER
was O
secret O
and O
very O
quiet O
. O

Any O
newspapers B-TER
which O
reported O
the O
case O
were O
confiscated B-TER
. O

We O
were O
dictated O
the O
text O
of O
the O
obituary O
notice O
, O
so O
we O
preferred O
to O
simply O
inform O
people B-TER
that O
he O
had O
died B-TER
. O

I O
declare O
again O
that O
everything O
I O
have O
described O
here O
is O
the O
truth O
and O
that O
I O
have O
not O
added O
or O
changed O
anything O
. O
