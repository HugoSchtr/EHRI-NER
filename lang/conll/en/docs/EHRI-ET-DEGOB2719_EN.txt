The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Before O
they O
entrained O
us O
and O
deported B-TER
us O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
we O
stayed O
for O
around O
five O
weeks O
in O
the O
brick O
factory O
of O
Munk√°cs B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
station O
they O
separated O
us O
from O
our O
parents B-TER
, O
whom O
we O
never O
saw O
again O
. O

We O
went O
into O
Camp B-TER
A I-TER
, O
from O
where O
we O
were O
led O
to O
Brezinka B-TER
5 O
days O
later O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
here O
till O
December O
. O

Brezinka B-TER
was O
constructed O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
surrounded O
by O
5 O
crematoria B-TER
. O

We O
received O
and O
sorted O
out O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
and O
the O
luggage O
that O
deported B-TER
people O
had O
brought O
. O

We O
also O
found O
our O
own O
stuff O
, O
and O
we O
wanted O
to O
put O
on O
our O
sweaters B-TER
because O
we O
were O
very O
cold B-TER
. O

However O
, O
when O
they O
noticed O
it O
they O
gave O
us O
25 O
blows O
and O
seized O
all O
that O
we O
had O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
could O
save O
was O
a O
photo B-TER
of O
our O
father B-TER
that O
we O
found O
also O
in O
Brezinka B-TER
among O
the O
several O
thousands O
of O
other O
photos B-TER
. O

We O
hid O
it O
in O
our O
shoes B-TER
and O
that O
was O
how O
we O
kept O
it O
for O
a O
year O
, O
which O
was O
quite O
a O
thing O
because O
they O
searched O
us O
all O
the O
time O
and O
more O
than O
once O
they O
took O
our O
old O
clothes B-TER
and O
gave O
us O
new O
ones O
. O

We O
still O
have O
the O
photo B-TER
even O
if O
it O
is O
torn O
and O
tattered O
. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
memory O
that O
remained O
of O
our O
parents B-TER
. O

Day O
by O
day O
we O
saw O
the O
long O
queues O
that O
led O
to O
the O
crematoria B-TER
but O
we O
never O
saw O
anyone O
returning O
from O
there O
. O

Around O
half O
of O
the O
women B-TER
who O
had O
worked B-TER
for O
three O
months O
in O
Krakow B-LOC
and O
came O
back O
here O
were O
singled B-TER
out I-TER
although O
those O
were O
young O
and O
fit O
for O
work O
. O

Once O
every O
four O
weeks O
we O
had O
a O
day O
off O
, O
when O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
a O
concert O
. O

Jewish O
boys O
and O
girls O
had O
to O
play O
instruments O
, O
sing O
and O
dance O
while O
a O
few O
metres O
away O
endless O
queues O
of O
innocent O
people O
headed O
towards O
their O
horrible B-TER
end I-TER
. O

Yet O
, O
a O
boy O
could O
not O
speak O
with O
a O
girl O
because O
they O
would O
immediately O
send O
you O
to O
a O
punishment O
kommando B-TER
to O
shovel O
coal O
or O
do O
some O
other O
kind O
of O
difficult O
job O
. O

In O
December O
, O
when O
no O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
and O
when O
they O
made O
disappear O
all O
traces O
of O
this O
horrible O
extermination B-TER
of O
people O
, O
and O
burnt O
also O
the O
men O
whom O
they O
had O
forced O
to O
assist O
with O
burning O
, O
we O
were O
also O
transferred O
from O
this O
place O
to O
Reichenbach B-LOC
. O

We O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
radio O
factory O
Telefunken O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
supervised O
us O
but O
we O
had O
a O
relatively O
good O
life B-TER
. O

We O
got O
300 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
twice O
a O
day O
cooked O
warm O
food B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
till O
the O
middle O
of O
February O
, O
when O
they O
made O
us O
depart O
on O
foot O
, O
and O
we O
did O
around O
150 O
kilometres O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
time O
we O
got O
a O
kilo O
of O
bread B-TER
each O
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
for O
four O
days O
, O
and O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
in O
school O
buildings O
. O

There O
were O
1,000 O
of O
us O
, O
and O
we O
were O
always O
lodged O
in O
such O
a O
small O
place O
that O
we O
could O
hardly O
sit O
down O
, O
so O
every O
morning O
we O
stood O
up O
more O
tired O
and O
worn O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Trautenau B-LOC
, O
and O
spent O
there O
three O
days O
. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
any O
bread B-TER
only O
some O
warm O
water O
with O
a O
few O
potato B-TER
peels O
. O

They O
put O
us O
here O
in O
open O
wagons B-TER
and O
we O
travelled O
for O
7 O
days O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
rail O
system O
was O
bombed B-TER
at O
several O
points O
and O
we O
travelled O
back O
and O
forth O
; O
they O
did O
know O
where O
to O
go O
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
journey O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Bergen- B-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
and O
thought O
our O
journey O
had O
finally O
ended O
and O
we O
could O
have O
a O
rest O
at O
least O
for O
a O
night O
even O
if O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

But O
they O
did O
not O
receive O
us O
either O
here O
. O

The O
train B-TER
stood O
still O
24 O
hours O
before O
we O
departed O
again O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Porta B-LOC
and O
remained O
there O
. O

This O
was O
a O
new O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
got O
100 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
watery O
soup B-TER
a O
day O
but O
had O
to O
work O
12 O
hours O
without O
a O
break O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
an O
underground O
factory B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
cross O
a O
high O
hill O
to O
get O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Our O
wooden B-TER
clogs I-TER
were O
torn O
to O
pieces O
and O
we O
remained O
barefoot O
. O

Our O
weak O
bodies O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
steep O
slope O
. O

Girls O
fainted O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
girls O
who O
had O
earlier O
got O
on O
so O
well O
despite O
the O
scarcity O
. O

We O
got O
down O
into O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
which O
was O
not O
fully O
finished O
yet O
. O

Everything O
was O
perfectly O
new O
and O
shiny O
; O
but O
it O
was O
dark B-TER
and I-TER
airless I-TER
. O

The O
lack O
of O
sunshine O
and O
fresh O
air O
was O
horrible O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
we O
felt O
as O
though O
we O
would O
not O
get O
any O
fresh O
air O
and O
drown O
. O

5 O
weeks O
later O
, O
we O
left O
for O
Fallersleben B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
lasted O
for O
2 O
days O
. O

We O
got O
not O
even O
a O
bite O
of O
food B-TER
or O
a O
drop B-TER
of I-TER
water I-TER
during O
these O
two O
days O
, O
and O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet B-TER
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
we O
arrived O
, O
we O
still O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
and O
we O
believed O
we O
were O
to O
starve B-TER
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
following O
day O
, O
finally O
we O
got O
some O
soup B-TER
and O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
for O
5 O
days O
before O
they O
newly O
entrained O
us O
and O
the O
next O
day O
we O
arrived O
in O
Salzwedel B-LOC
. O

The O
first O
day O
we O
got O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
the O
second O
day O
50 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
a O
plate O
of O
soup B-TER
. O

There O
were O
already O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
kept O
here O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
there O
were O
no O
places O
for O
us O
, O
not O
even O
a O
little O
straw O
, O
so O
we O
slept B-TER
on O
bare O
floor O
. O

In O
the O
last O
days O
we O
did O
not O
get O
bread B-TER
either O
here O
and O
we O
could O
not O
see O
any O
water B-TER
. O

We O
got O
only O
the O
usual O
dried O
potatoes B-TER
. O

The O
squalor B-TER
that O
was O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
is O
unimaginable O
. O

Germans B-TER
wanted O
to O
set O
fire O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
together O
with O
us O
but O
the O
ca O
. O

150 O
French B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
, O
who O
stayed O
here O
, O
saved B-TER
our I-TER
lives I-TER
with O
composure O
and O
courage O
. O

Our O
parents B-TER
, O
two O
younger O
brothers B-TER
, O
our O
elder O
brother B-TER
and O
elder O
sister B-TER
with O
her O
two O
little O
children B-TER
all O
died B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

All O
that O
we O
desire O
is O
to B-TER
get I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine I-TER
. O
