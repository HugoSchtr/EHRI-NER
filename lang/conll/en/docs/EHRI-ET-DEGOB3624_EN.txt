The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
I O
passed O
the O
days O
of O
the O
siege O
in O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
. O

The O
2nd O
of O
January O
, O
1945 O
, O
an O

group O
entered O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
as O
they O
said O
to O
control O
Schutzpasses O
. O

Naturally O
, O
they O
did O
not O
find O
them O
acceptable O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
with O
the O
identity O
check O
. O

They O
gathered O
us O
in O
a O
room O
and O
selected O
and O
separated O
36 O
of O
us O
. O

There O
was O
no O
one O
older O
than O
70 O
in O
this O
selected O
group O
, O
while O
there O
were O
some O
severely O
sick B-TER
people O
among O
them O
, O
like O
someone O
with O
advanced O
cancer B-TER
. O

I O
asked O
for O
permission O
to O
go O
up O
to O
my O
room O
for O
my O
stuff O
, O
but O
they O
let O
me O
go O
only O
with O
an O
escort O
. O

As O
I O
later O
learnt O
, O
it O
was O
3 O
am O
when O
we O
departed O
among O
falling B-TER
bombs I-TER
and O
shells O
with O
the O
alleged O
reason O
to O
get O
our O
identity O
checked O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
in O
Pozsonyi B-LOC
Road I-LOC
. O

First O
, O
they O
led O
us O
into O
a O
completely O
dark O
room O
, O
and O
later O
led O
us O
into O
another O
room O
, O
and O
on O
the O
pretext O
of O
checking O
our O
identity O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
committee O
seized B-TER
all O
our O
belongings O
. O

They O
took B-TER
my O
coat B-TER
, O
my O
gloves B-TER
, O
turned O
out O
my O
pockets O
, O
took O
off O
also O
the O
two O
blouses B-TER
I O
had O
on O
to O
search O
it O
and O
check O
whether O
I O
had O
not O
hidden O
anything O
or O
sewed O
something O
valuable O
in O
them O
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
they O
even O
seized B-TER
my O
handkerchief O
. O

Having O
searched B-TER
us O
they O
sent O
everyone O
into O
the O
lobby O
, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
all O
there O
, O
they O
rechecked B-TER
whether O
we O
did O
not O
leave O
anything O
behind O
, O
any O
food B-TER
in O
the O
searching O
room O
. O

Naturally O
, O
they O
collected O
what O
they O
still O
found O
there O
. O

Now O
, O
they O
led O
us O
back O
into O
the O
room O
where O
we O
were O
the O
first O
time O
. O

There O
were O
already O
some O
people B-TER
here O
when O
our O
group O
of O
36 O
people B-TER
arrived O
; O
at O
the O
end O
there O
might O
have O
been O
40 O
- O
42 O
of O
us O
altogether O
. O

Everyone O
tried O
to O
find O
some O
good O
posture O
. O

The O
guards O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
made O
sure O
we O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
. O

We O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
if O
someone O
asked O
for O
water B-TER
, O
they O
conceded O
to O
give O
it O
. O

I O
have O
to O
note O
that O
we O
had O
lived O
so O
isolated O
from O
everything O
in O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
that O
we O
had O
not O
heard O
about O
the O
already O
frequent O
cases O
when O
they O
shot O
people O
into O
the O
Danube B-LOC
. O

I O
did O
not O
suspect O
anything O
like O
that O
, O
and O
believed O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be O
put O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
after O
they O
had O
robbed B-TER
us O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
someone O
asked O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
us O
, O
where O
they O
would O
bring O
us O
. O

They O
answered O
we O
were O
going O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
Buda B-LOC
to O
do O
some O
work B-TER
. O

All O
day O
long O
we O
sat O
there O
gloomy O
and O
exhausted O
, O
while O
during O
the O
night O
we O
had O
to O
start O
off O
lined O
up O
in O
pairs O
. O

It O
was O
a O
light O
night O
with O
an O
open O
sky O
and O
we O
could O
clearly O
see O
the O
fights O
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
cold O
, O
as O
we O
were O
badly O
dressed B-TER
and O
had O
no O
coats B-TER
. O

We O
were O
walking O
along O
the O
Danube B-LOC
towards O
the O
Parliament B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
horrible O
what O
we O
saw O
: O
all O
the O
way O
along O
the O
bank O
of O
the O
Danube B-LOC
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
and O
horses O
were O
lying O
around O
. O

We O
arrived O
close O
to O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
where O
they O
wanted O
to O
lead O
us O
down O
the O
stairs O
next O
to O
the O
Parliament B-LOC
. O

My O
partner O
commented O
: O
Look O
, O
they O
want O
to O
do O
something O
evil O
. O

Since O
the O
stairs O
were O
already O
bombed B-TER
and O
we O
could O
not O
go O
down O
to O
the O
bank O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
leader O
told O
us O
we O
would O
go O
now O
to O
Buda B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
we O
did O
: O
We O
crossed O
the O
Danube B-LOC
on O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

On O
the O
other O
bank O
we O
started O
to O
head O
towards O
Margit B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
the O
lower O
quay O
. O

Women B-TER
went O
ahead O
, O
and O
men B-TER
– O
around O
eight O
of O
them O
– O
followed O
behind O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
the O
leader O
said O
that O
men B-TER
should O
stay O
behind O
and O
women B-TER
should O
proceed O
. O

Next O
, O
we O
heard O
more O
shots B-TER
from O
close O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
at O
my O
side O
commented O
again O
: O
Look O
, O
these O
have O
been O
shot O
! O
I O
still O
did O
not O
want O
to O
believe O
they O
could O
be O
so O
evil O
, O
and O
said O
it O
could O
not O
happen O
that O
so O
many O
people O
got O
shot B-TER
and O
you O
could O
not O
hear O
a O
voice O
. O

I O
still O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
meant O
if O
someone O
was O
shot B-TER
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O
from O
very O
close O
. O

The O
two O
leading O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
returned O
to O
us O
but O
without O
the O
men B-TER
and O
we O
still O
carried O
on O
a O
little O
while O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
they O
told O
us O
we O
should O
turn O
backwards O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
became O
convinced O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
could O
aim O
at O
was O
destroying B-TER
us I-TER
. O

If O
they O
had O
had O
another O
goal O
in O
mind O
we O
would O
have O
continued O
our O
walk O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
I O
was O
scared O
but O
rather O
I O
felt O
surprised O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
that O
everything O
would O
finish O
. O

The O
others O
were O
silent O
, O
too O
. O

They O
ordered O
us O
to O
stay O
one O
by O
one O
facing O
the O
Danube B-LOC
. O

It O
occurred O
only O
to O
a O
fifteen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
next O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
together O
with O
her O
mother B-TER
and O
aunt B-TER
, O
to O
start O
crying O
for O
help O
in O
her O
high O
childish O
voice O
. O

They O
started O
to O
shoot B-TER
them O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
; O
I O
instinctively O
threw O
myself O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
this O
idea O
came O
to O
my O
mind O
, O
now O
, O
I O
can O
not O
account O
for O
it O
; O
maybe O
I O
wanted O
to O
die B-TER
like O
this O
. O

The O
poor O
woman B-TER
next O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
hospital B-TER
after O
a O
suicide B-TER
attempt I-TER
and O
wanted O
to O
die B-TER
by O
force O
, O
started O
now O
crying O
after O
the O
first O
shot B-TER
that O
she O
was O
still O
alive O
. O

I O
heard O
the O
voice O
of O
one O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
men O
as O
he O
asked O
who O
was O
shouting O
, O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
at O
her O
again O
. O

I O
decided O
not O
to O
move O
: O
either O
they O
would O
shoot B-TER
me O
and O
everything O
would O
be O
over O
in O
seconds O
or O
I O
would O
hold O
out O
. O

They O
checked O
whether O
I O
was O
still O
moving O
and O
I O
heard O
them O
to O
comment O
: O
This O
is O
dead O
already O
. O

They O
did O
not O
shoot B-TER
me O
not O
even O
in O
a O
second O
round O
, O
while O
they O
sent B-TER
another I-TER
bullet I-TER
in O
my O
neighbour O
. O

There O
was O
moonlight O
, O
and O
the O
water O
carried O
all O
sounds O
well O
, O
so O
I O
clearly O
heard O
and O
saw O
everything O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
now O
drop O
the O
corpses B-TER
into O
the O
Danube B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
simulate O
I O
was O
dead B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
with O
an O
eye O
that O
they O
began O
to O
drag O
the O
bodies B-TER
towards O
the O
water O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
when O
an O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
man O
grabbed O
my O
legs O
and O
pulled O
me O
away O
. O

I O
have O
to O
note O
that O
the O
bank O
of O
Danube B-LOC
is O
a O
steep O
and O
high O
wall O
here O
; O
there O
are O
no O
stairs O
at O
this O
part O
. O

I O
felt O
being O
pulled O
towards O
the O
wall O
and O
my O
upper O
body O
fell O
down O
and O
he O
let O
my O
legs O
fall O
, O
too O
. O

Once O
again O
I O
had O
luck O
, O
because O
the O
distance O
got O
shorter O
with O
the O
length O
of O
my O
body O
, O
so O
I O
fell O
less O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
I O
started O
falling O
and O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
man O
let O
my O
legs O
go O
but O
I O
did O
not O
fall O
into O
water O
but O
on O
a O
one O
and O
a O
half O
metres O
wide O
solid O
strip O
between O
the O
wall O
and O
water O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
cared O
about O
was O
to O
remain O
motionless O
. O

I O
fell O
on O
my O
face O
and O
did O
not O
even O
feel O
when O
I O
was O
hit O
, O
I O
saw O
only O
later O
that O
I O
fell O
on O
soft O
sand O
. O

I O
remained O
still O
in O
that O
position O
. O

Water O
was O
shallow O
here O
, O
and O
did O
not O
take O
away O
immediately O
the O
corpses B-TER
of O
my O
unfortunate O
companions O
. O

I O
heard O
as O
they O
said O
above O
me O
: O
Water O
will O
take O
them O
away O
. O

I O
heard O
this O
comment O
perfectly O
clearly O
, O
and O
studied O
everything O
precisely O
. O

Voices O
got O
further O
and O
further O
away O
; O
they O
left O
. O

I O
cautiously O
raised O
my O
head O
and O
looked O
up O
, O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
voice O
from O
behind O
: O
Do O
n’t O
move O
, O
because O
they O
are O
still O
here O
! O
My O
companion O
could O
see O
up O
on O
the O
wall O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
much O
I O
may O
have O
been O
waiting O
there O
: O
a O
half O
an O
hour O
or O
two O
hours O
. O

I O
calculated O
that O
they O
must O
have O
been O
already O
off O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
rise O
cautiously O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
me O
, O
whether O
I O
was O
alive O
and O
could O
stand O
up O
. O

I O
was O
uncertain O
about O
my O
situation O
and O
started O
to O
touch O
the O
parts O
of O
my O
body O
. O

I O
could O
stand O
up O
, O
nothing O
happened O
to O
me O
, O
only O
my O
nose O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
bleeding O
. O

It O
got O
injured O
when O
I O
fell O
on O
my O
face O
but O
it O
was O
only O
a O
minor O
graze O
. O

I O
looked O
around O
and O
tried O
to O
orient O
myself O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
dreaming O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
started O
to O
talk O
again O
: O
I O
am O
the O
sister O
of O
the O
caretaker O
and O
if O
you O
remain O
alive O
and O
can O
call O
for O
help O
, O
call O
the O
police O
or O
the O
ambulance O
. O

I O
knew O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
, O
as O
the O
ambulance B-TER
did O
not O
function O
in O
these O
times O
. O

I O
began O
screaming O
as O
loud O
as O
possible O
: O
Help O
, O
ambulance O
, O
police O
! O
I O
heard O
nothing O
but O
cries O
from O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
shot B-TER
men B-TER
and O
the O
noise O
of O
drifting O
ice O
. O

No O
one O
was O
around O
. O

I O
desperately O
realised O
that O
crying O
for O
help O
was O
pointless O
. O

In O
front O
of O
me O
there O
was O
the O
icy O
Danube B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
without O
a O
jacket B-TER
in O
the O
cold O
of O
January O
, O
behind O
, O
there O
was O
a O
steep O
wall O
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
stairs O
, O
and O
corpses B-TER
lay O
all O
around O
. O

Russian B-ORG
shells O
were O
flying O
from O
Pest B-LOC
to I-LOC
Buda I-LOC
. O

I O
tried O
to O
help O
that O
poor O
agonising O
woman B-TER
, O
I O
pulled O
her O
a O
little O
bit O
towards O
the O
bank O
, O
she O
was O
awfully O
heavy O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
her O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
who O
the O
people O
were O
whom O
the O
bandits O
had O
shot O
. O

I O
found O
another O
breathing O
woman B-TER
and O
I O
pulled O
her O
out O
, O
too O
. O

I O
started O
thinking O
, O
and O
understood O
that O
I O
should O
not O
stay O
there O
but O
ought O
to O
get O
away O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

Far O
away O
I O
saw O
a O
military B-TER
landing O
stage O
with O
a O
bridge O
to O
the O
bank O
, O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
reach O
it O
at O
any O
price O
. O

I O
waded O
into O
water O
in O
the O
overshoes B-TER
I O
still O
had O
on O
and O
tried O
to O
reach O
the O
bridge O
. O

The O
water O
was O
deep O
and O
I O
failed O
. O

Now O
, O
however O
, O
the O
instinct O
for O
survival O
did O
start O
working O
in O
me O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
remain O
alive O
at O
any O
price O
. O

I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
sandy O
strip O
, O
but O
not O
to O
the O
corpses B-TER
but O
a O
little O
bit O
further O
away O
. O

I O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
waited O
. O

Soon O
, O
around O
7 O
- O
8 O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
walked O
down O
the O
bridge O
and O
jumped O
into O
a O
wide O
military B-TER
boat O
and O
started O
to O
row O
exactly O
in O
my O
direction O
by O
chance O
. O

Their O
leader O
noticed O
me O
and O
said O
: O
Da O
ist O
jemand O
. O

Soon O
they O
reached O
the O
shore O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

They O
must O
have O
thought O
I O
had O
fallen O
off O
the O
wall O
, O
and O
their O
leader O
even O
asked O
: O
Hat O
Wehgetan O
? O
I O
promptly O
understood O
the O
situation O
and O
responded O
: O
Yes O
. O

They O
jumped O
out O
, O
and O
climbed O
on O
the O
wall O
, O
one O
standing O
on O
the O
other O
. O

I O
asked O
whether O
they O
could O
also O
help O
me O
up O
. O

The O
leader O
responded O
laughingly O
: O
Denken O
sie O
nicht O
, O
dass O
Sie O
sind O
einbischen O
schwach O
? O
I O
asked O
whether O
they O
could O
find O
an O
ambulance O
but O
he O
answered O
: O
Nein O
, O
da O
sind O
schon O
die O
Russen O
. O

However O
, O
he O
offered O
to O
put O
me O
in O
the O
boat O
and O
bring O
me O
to O
the O
bank O
, O
as O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
7 O
am O
soon O
when O
people B-TER
could O
stay O
in O
the O
street O
. O

I O
saw O
that O
he O
noticed O
I O
was O
surprised O
at O
what O
he O
had O
said O
since O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
7 O
am O
was O
the O
time O
when O
already O
civilians O
could O
go O
in O
the O
street O
. O

They O
encouraged O
me O
that O
I O
would O
surely O
find O
a O
policeman B-TER
even O
if O
I O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
call O
the O
ambulance B-TER
. O

They O
lifted O
me O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
covered O
me O
with O
a O
blanket O
and O
landed O
at O
the O
military B-TER
bridge O
; O
their O
leader O
accompanied O
me O
to O
the O
bank O
and O
put O
a O
cover O
on O
me O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
bad O
but O
I O
tried O
to O
pretend O
I O
felt O
really O
bad O
. O

After O
a O
few O
steps O
, O
it O
came O
to O
my O
mind O
that O
I O
should O
thank O
them O
for O
their O
favour O
and O
also O
wanted O
to O
give O
back O
the O
blanket O
but O
their O
leader O
urged O
me O
to O
take O
it O
with O
me O
. O

I O
started O
off O
but O
now O
I O
had O
a O
great O
problem O
: O
I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
to O
go O
and O
what O
to O
do O
. O

First O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
go O
and O
see O
a O
Christian B-TER
friend O
of O
mine O
living O
in O
Buda B-LOC
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
make O
her O
troubles O
and O
anyway O
my O
mother B-TER
remained O
in O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
, O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
whatever O
the O
cost O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
how O
one O
could O
cross O
the O
bridge O
without O
getting O
his O
or O
her O
identity O
checked O
. O

I O
walked O
on O
the O
lower O
quay O
where O
I O
did O
not O
meet O
anyone O
. O

However O
, O
I O
needed O
to O
climb O
up O
when O
I O
reached O
the O
Chain B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
. O

There O
were O
only O
soldiers B-TER
walking O
here O
, O
and O
no O
one O
cared O
about O
me O
, O
I O
was O
not O
at O
all O
a O
curious O
phenomenon O
, O
they O
must O
have O
thought O
I O
was O
rushing O
towards O
an O
air B-TER
raid I-TER
shelter O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
front O
of O
a O
guard B-TER
of O
three O
members O
on O
the O
bridge O
, O
and O
before O
they O
could O
have O
asked O
anything O
I O
asked O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
first O
aid O
station O
on O
the O
Pest B-LOC
bank O
of O
the O
river O
as O
I O
had O
been O
injured O
. O

By O
chance O
I O
was O
lucky O
again O
because O
a O
soldier B-TER
with O
a O
more O
sympathetic O
face O
responded O
that O
there O
were O
no O
first B-TER
- I-TER
aid I-TER
centres I-TER
on O
the O
Pest B-LOC
bank O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
think O
I O
had O
any O
problem O
with O
my O
face O
, O
it O
was O
at O
the O
most O
a O
little O
dirty O
. O

He O
suggested O
I O
should O
walk O
towards O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
first B-TER
- I-TER
aid I-TER
centre I-TER
also O
on O
the O
Buda B-LOC
bank O
. O

Naturally O
, O
I O
could O
do O
nothing O
else O
but O
go O
that O
way O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
a O
soldier B-TER
became O
suspicious O
of O
me O
and O
stood O
in O
my O
way O
. O

When O
I O
asked O
how O
I O
could O
cross O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
, O
whether O
it O
was O
possible O
now O
to O
cross O
it O
, O
he O
asked O
why O
I O
wanted O
to O
cross O
the O
bridge O
and O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
there O
anyway O
. O

I O
said O
I O
had O
visited O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
but O
he O
kept O
on O
interrogating O
me O
and O
asked O
where O
this O
friend O
lived O
. O

I O
said O
in O
Lánchíd B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

Where O
is O
Lánchíd O
Street O
and O
where O
do O
you O
live O
? O
I O
said O
in O
Damjanich B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
I O
indicated O
my O
old O
flat O
and O
he O
continued O
to O
ask O
me O
how O
I O
would O
get O
from O
Erzsébet B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
to O
Damjanich B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

When O
I O
explained O
him O
the O
route O
his O
suspicion O
disappeared O
and O
told O
me O
that O
bridges O
were O
still O
not O
being O
bombed B-TER
, O
and O
one O
could O
cross O
them O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
did O
not O
ask O
anything O
from O
anyone O
but O
ran O
through O
the O
bridge O
trying O
to O
evade O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
guards O
. O

Kossuth B-LOC
Lajos I-LOC
Street I-LOC
looked O
very O
bad O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
got O
into O
Weiss B-TER
Alice I-TER
Hospital I-TER
! O
