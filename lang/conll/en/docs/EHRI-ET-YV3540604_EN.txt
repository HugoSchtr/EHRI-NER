, O
he O
is O
also O
one O
of O
those O
remaining O
alive O
who O
were O
on O
my O
transport B-TER
. O

I O
have O
many O
more O
poems B-TER
that O
I O
composed O
but O
I O
have O
no O
paper O
to O
write O
, O
but O
I O
will O
send O
to O
you O
also O
my O
experiences O
which O
I O
endured O
in O
eleven O
camps B-TER
and O
three O
ghettos B-TER
. O

My O
memories O
from O
February O
6 O
, O
1942 O
, O
to O
February O
7 O
, O
1947 O
. O

In O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
, O
only O
a O
few O
months O
after O
the O
Great O
Aktion B-TER
in O
which O
more O
than O
ten O
thousand O
of O
our O
dearest O
ones O
were O
taken B-TER
away I-TER
, O
on O
January O
25 O
, O
1941 O
, O
they O
again O
began O
talking O
about O
an O
action B-TER
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

Later O
the O
talk O
about O
sending O
600 O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
to O
Riga B-LOC
intensified O
. O

However O
, O
we O
knew O
what O
this O
meant O
for O
us O
and O
we O
began O
to O
hide B-TER
ourselves O
away O
in O
the O
hiding B-TER
places I-TER
. O

A O
few O
days O
later O
the O
atmosphere O
calmed O
down O
again O
, O
and O
we O
gradually O
came O
out O
[ O
of O
the O
hiding B-TER
places I-TER
] O
. O

In O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
at O
that O
time O
they O
needed O
working B-TER
hands I-TER
for O
the O
Kovno B-LOC
aerodrome O
. O

So O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
went O
out O
onto O
the O
street O
I O
was O
caught O
and O
straight O
away O
sent O
to O
the O
work B-TER
at O
the O
aerodrome O
. O

That O
day O
there O
was O
a O
burning O
frost B-TER
which O
cut O
like O
knives O
, O
we O
all O
went O
out O
to O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
there O
was O
then O
a O
panic O
. O

They O
immediately O
slammed O
the O
doors O
with O
the O
bolts O
, O
no O
living O
soul O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
outside O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
policemen B-TER
. O

However O
, O
that O
day O
we O
did O
not O
work B-TER
in O
the O
aerodrome O
. O

We O
just O
stood O
and O
talked O
with O
one O
another O
about O
the O
good O
conduct O
of O
the O
guards B-TER
, O
how O
they O
did O
not O
herd O
us O
to O
work B-TER
as O
they O
did O
on O
all O
other O
occasions O
. O

Yet O
that O
day O
also O
passed O
slowly O
and O
sadly O
. O

When O
3.30 O
arrived O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
an O
order O
to O
lay O
down O
the O
axes O
and O
spades O
and O
the O
working B-TER
day O
was O
over O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
way O
we O
directly O
found O
out O
that O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
something O
bad O
had O
happened O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
know O
what O
. O

Close O
to O
the O
door O
they O
arranged O
us O
in O
rows B-TER
of O
twenty O
men B-TER
. O

Opposite O
the O
Work O
Office O
and O
in O
the O
square O
stood O
the O
commandant B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
ghetto I-TER
, O
Jordan B-PER
, O
with O
his O
retinue O
and O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Labor O
Office O
Lurie O
and O
Arenshtam B-PER
and O
the O
Jewish O
police B-TER
, O
and O
they O
herded O
us O
straight O
into O
through O
a O
fenced O
wire O
gate O
, O
a O
few O
people B-TER
straight O
away O
tried O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

However O
, O
immediately O
a O
few O
shots O
rang O
out O
and O
they O
took O
us O
straight O
to O
the O
kloyz O
small O
synagogue O
or O
study O
house O
. O

They O
beat O
us O
with O
the O
rifles O
and O
they O
filled O
the O
kloyz O
with O
people B-TER
so O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
breath O
; O
really O
we O
were O
suffocating O
. O

Immediately O
, O
Jewish O
policemen B-TER
came O
and O
took O
out O
their O
people B-TER
. O

Later O
, O
the O
Jewish O
police B-TER
came O
again O
and O
it O
became O
bitter O
and O
dark O
for O
us O
, O
the O
black B-TER
trade I-TER
began O
– O
how O
much O
will O
you O
give O
, O
you O
get O
out O
straight O
away O
, O
five O
golden O
coins O
and O
a O
golden O
watch O
and O
the O
deal O
is O
done O
, O
hand O
it O
over O
. O

And O
now O
take O
an O
armband O
and O
a O
police O
hat O
and O
follow O
him O
out O
. O

And O
so O
it O
went O
on O
, O
and O
we O
still O
remained O
in O
the O
kloyz O
. O

A O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
was O
conducted O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
they O
seized O
more O
people B-TER
because O
they O
had O
not O
reached O
the O
required O
number O
due O
to O
the O
police B-TER
letting O
half O
the O
people B-TER
go O
for B-TER
gold I-TER
and I-TER
money I-TER
, O
with O
the O
agreement O
of O
the O
Labor O
Office O
, O
at O
its O
head O
Lurie B-PER
and O
Arenshtam B-PER
, O
nicknamed O
the O
Hunderter O
[ O
the O
hundred O
] O
or O
Mapu O
. O

Yet O
the O
number O
had O
been O
reached O
by O
7 O
P.M. O
, O
and O
they O
arranged O
us O
again O
in O
front O
of O
the O
commandant B-TER
in O
rows O
of O
twenty O
men B-TER
and O
march O
. O

A O
few O
shots O
, O
childish O
cries O
, O
and O
the O
wails O
of O
women B-TER
were O
heard O
. O

We O
walked O
and O
we O
thought O
they O
were O
taking O
us O
to O
the O
Ninth B-LOC
Fort I-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
commandant B-TER
assured O
us O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
afraid O
: O
we O
were O
going O
to O
work B-TER
and O
not O
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
people B-TER
in O
Kovno B-LOC
would O
yet O
be O
jealous O
of O
us O
. O

We O
would O
forthwith O
be O
able O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
to O
our O
families B-TER
. O

But O
promises O
and O
love O
[ O
maybe O
: O
being O
nice O
] O
do O
not O
cost O
money O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

We O
were O
well O
acquainted O
with O
German B-TER
promises O
but O
could O
not O
help O
ourselves O
. O

So O
they O
took O
us O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Laisvės B-LOC
Alėja I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
in O
Schanz B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
loaded O
us O
into O
the O
wagons O
, O
forty O
men B-TER
to O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

Before O
they O
closed O
the O
wagons O
they O
gave O
us O
bread B-TER
with O
a O
purse O
of O
matches O
so O
that O
we O
could O
smoke O
and O
be O
quiet O
. O

And O
when O
they O
had O
loaded O
us O
into O
the O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
there O
were O
six O
hundred O
of O
us O
, O
including O
children B-TER
and O
women B-TER
; O
there O
were O
also O
a O
few O
volunteers O
like O
the O
crazy O
people B-TER
Galu O
and O
Mapu O
. O

This O
was O
February O
6 O
, O
1942 O
, O
and O
we O
left O
at O
midnight O
. O

The O
wagons O
were O
locked O
from O
the O
outside O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
train B-TER
started O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
station O
, O
immediately O
a O
few O
lads O
opened O
the O
windows O
and O
doors O
and O
a O
series O
of O
people B-TER
began O
jumping B-TER
through O
the O
doors O
and O
windows O
. O

From O
my O
wagon O
twelve O
people B-TER
jumped B-TER
out O
straight O
away O
; O
from O
another O
wagon O
there O
jumped B-TER
out O
seventeen O
persons B-TER
and O
in O
Jonava B-LOC
( O
Yanov B-LOC
) O
and O
near O
Šiauliai B-LOC
( O
Shavel B-LOC
) O
also O
a O
few O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
. O

I O
myself O
also O
wanted O
to O
jump B-TER
out I-TER
. O

I O
was O
standing O
ready O
to B-TER
jump I-TER
when O
all O
at O
once O
I O
felt O
that O
someone O
was O
holding O
me O
by O
my O
coat B-TER
and O
a O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
voice O
calls O
out O
my O
name O
, O
Shane O
, O
I O
wo O
n’t O
let O
you O
jump O
, O
you O
stay O
here O
. O

I O
turn O
around O
, O
angry O
. O

It O
was O
a O
friend O
of O
my O
wife B-TER
, O
Sorel B-PER
Kabinsky I-PER
. O

And O
later O
I O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
jump B-TER
out I-TER
and O
continued O
on O
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
cold O
in O
the O
wagons O
and O
there O
was O
no O
water O
to O
drink O
, O
only O
dry O
bread B-TER
and O
it O
stank O
in O
the O
wagon O
because O
people B-TER
had O
to O
relieve O
their O
needs O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
by O
day O
and O
stood O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
the O
Šiauliai B-LOC
station O
. O

Jewish O
girls B-TER
from O
Šiauliai B-LOC
worked B-TER
at O
the O
station O
and O
they O
told O
us O
about O
the O
aktions B-TER
in O
Šiauliai B-LOC
. O

Thanks O
to O
them O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
icicles B-TER
to O
drink O
and O
bread B-TER
, O
and O
they O
were O
herded O
away O
from O
us O
so O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
with O
them O
. O

Later O
they O
opened O
our O
wagon B-TER
and O
we O
got O
some O
fresh O
air O
, O
relief O
from O
the O
stink O
, O
and O
we O
received O
money O
– O
17 O
marks O
in O
our O
wagon B-TER
. O

In O
other O
wagons B-TER
they O
received O
only O
12 O
marks O
. O

This O
was O
because O
our O
wagon O
had O
fewer O
people B-TER
in O
it O
after O
a O
lot O
had O
jumped B-TER
out I-TER
. O

And O
so O
we O
travelled O
on O
further O
for O
two O
days O
and O
three O
nights O
until O
we O
reached O
Riga B-LOC
. O

There O
began O
my O
wandering O
through O
eleven O
camps B-TER
and O
( O
3 O
) O
three O
ghettos B-TER
and O
my O
experiences O
until O
today O
I O
will O
[ O
not O
or O
will O
later O
] O
Something O
seems O
to O
be O
missing O
here O
so O
that O
the O
sentence O
will O
make O
sense O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
will O
write O
more O
later O
. O

write O
to O
you O
because O
I O
do O
not O
have O
paper O
on O
which O
to O
write O
. O

And O
I O
attach O
here O
the O
poem B-TER
about O
February O
6 O
which O
I O
and O
another O
lad O
form O
Kovno B-LOC
composed O
in O
my O
café O
in O
the O
Riga B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
. O

My O
café O
in O
the O
Riga B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
was O
the O
only O
one O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
with O
music B-TER
and O
artists B-TER
also O
sang O
there O
. O

I O
ask O
you O
, O
Mr. O
Editor O
, O
that O
you O
print O
it O
and O
improve O
the O
wording O
, O
that O
means O
edit O
it O
, O
and O
please O
excuse O
my O
bad O
handwriting O
because O
I O
am O
right O
handed O
[ O
but O
] O
I O
am O
sadly O
an O
invalid B-TER
, O
I O
am O
missing O
three O
half O
fingers O
from O
my O
right O
hand O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
I O
endured O
things O
that O
would O
fill O
volumes O
. O

We O
were O
among O
the O
first O
of O
those O
sent O
to O
Riga B-LOC
and O
only O
twelve O
of O
us O
remain B-TER
alive I-TER
. O
