The O

of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
policy I-TER
outlined O
by O
President O
Kállay B-PER

his O

to O
the O

( O

) O
and O
the O
measures O
that O
followed O
represent O
the O
start O
of O
a O
new O
stage O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
’s O
official O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitism I-TER
. O

This O
R. O
Legation O
has O
repeatedly O
reported O
on O
the O
various O
developments O
and O
on O
individual O
aspects O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
in O
this O
Country O
, O
highlighting O
along O
the O
way O
the O
various O
obstacles O
that O
have O
hindered O
the O
implementation O
of O
radical O
measures B-TER
, O
the O
conflicting O
opinions O
within O
the O
Country O
, O
the O
Clergy B-TER
and O
Parliament O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER
, O
and O
on O
the O
frequent O
compromises O
ensuing O
from O
the O
doubts O
of O
a O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
at O
times O
unconvinced O
that O
a O
drastic O
action O
is O
wise O
. O

However O
, O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
now O
again O
surfaces O
on O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
political B-TER
scene I-TER
has O
changed O
deeply O
since O
the O
day O
when O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
linking O
its O
destiny O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
Powers I-TER
, O
necessarily O
had O
to O
do O
away O
, O
even O
in O
its O
interior O
politics B-TER
, O
with O
many O
hesitations O
and O
many O
formal O
shackles O
. O

Herein O
lies O
precisely O
the O
interest O
that O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
continues O
to O
attract O
after O
the O
emphatic O
and O
formally O
definitive O
official O
stance O
taken O
by O
the O
present O
Government B-TER
. O

We O
will O
not O
desist O
from O
the O
struggle O
– O
said O
Kállay O
– O
until O
with O
a O
systematic O
and O
ever O
increasing O
pace O
we O
have O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
Jews O
every O
sector O
of O
national O
life O
and O
we O
have O
at O
last O
entirely O
removed O
them O
from O
our O
Country O
. O

In O
order O
to O
appreciate O
the O
significance O
of O
these O
words O
and O
to O
understand O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
situation O
to O
which O
they O
refer O
it O
might O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
briefly O
reconsider O
the O
fundamental O
aspects O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Among O
the O
other O
misfortunes O
which O
befell O
this O
Country O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Turkish B-LOC
invasion O
there O
was O
also O
the O
influx O
of O
many O
Jews B-TER
who O
found O
a O
favourable O
situation O
under O
the O
Crescent O
. O

The O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Turks B-TER
caused O
most O
of O
them O
to O
leave O
. O

Later O
, O
the O
severe O
decrees O
of O
the O
Habsburgs O
, O
particularly O
Charles B-PER
III I-PER
and O
Maria B-PER
Theresa I-PER
, O
helped O
to O
keep O
the O
Jews B-TER
away O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Between O
1820 O
and O
1830 O
, O
however O
, O
there O
began O
that O
exodus O
of O
Jews B-TER
from O
Galicia B-LOC
to O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
territory O
which O
would O
continue O
uninterrupted O
into O
our O
own O
times O
, O
encouraged O
by O
the O
rise O
of O
capitalism O
and O
by O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
liberal O
governments B-TER
that O
enabled O
the O
Jews B-TER
to O
acquire O
predominance O
particularly O
in O
culture B-TER
and O
in O
the O
economy B-TER
. O

The O
census O
of O
1930 O
registered O
444,565 O
Jews B-TER
then O
present O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
to O
whom O
one O
must O
add O
78,190 O
in O

103,000 O
in O

( O

. O

Today O
there O
are O
approx O
. O

800,000 O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
about O
6.2 O
% O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
population O
( O
13,500,000 O
) O
, O
a O
percentage O
that O
within O
Europe O
is O
exceeded O
only O
by O
Poland B-LOC
, O
by O
Lithuania B-LOC
and O
perhaps O
by O
Romania B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
capital B-LOC
only O
( O
1,110,000 O
) O
the O
Jews B-TER
are O
over O
200,000 O
and O
have O
attained O
preeminent O
positions O
in O

, O
in O
manufacturing B-TER
, O
in O

, O
in O

and O
in O

Even O
the O
Hungarian O
aristocracy O
, O
which O
together O
with O
the O
great O
landowning O
middle O
classes O
has O
for O
centuries O
held O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
Country O
and O
has O
controlled O
it O
politically O
, O
has O
been O
unable O
or O
unwilling O
to O
oppose O
this O
invasion O
and O
in O
the O
end O
even O
acquiesced O
to O
it O
through O
a O
great O
many O
marriages B-TER
that O
proved O
eminently O
useful O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
for O
strengthening O
their O
position O
in O
political B-TER
life I-TER
. O

The O
numerous O
Liberal- O
Masonic B-TER
associations O
which O
emerged O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
in O
the O
second O
half O
of O
the O
past O
century O
and O
the O
Democratic B-TER
Party I-TER
, O
which O
immediately O
became O
the O
only O
workers O
’ O
party O
with O
a O
western O

style O
organization O
, O
formed O
the O
framework O
which O
protected O
Jewish B-TER
activity O
and O
the O
breeding O
ground O
both O
of O
the O
democratic O
revolution O
of O
October O
1918 O
and O
of O
the O
Communist B-TER
revolution O
of O
March O

Statistics O
show O
better O
than O
any O
discourse O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
invasion O
into O
Hungarian B-LOC
life O
. O

If O
we O
limit O
our O
analysis O
to O
Budapest B-LOC

which O
sums O
up O
the O
general O

we O

After O
the O

of O
the O
Bethlen B-PER
Cabinet O
( O

) O
, O
whose O
policy O
had O
greatly O
facilitated O
Jewish B-TER
intrusiveness O
, O
the O
Gömbös B-PER
Government B-TER
marked O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
resistance B-TER
movement O

solicited O

governments B-TER
that O
came O
later O
. O

The O
first O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
law I-TER
dates O
from O
April O
1938 O
. O

The O
text O
avoided O
the O
word O
“ O
Jews B-TER
” O
and O
granted O
such O
ample O
discrimination B-TER
as O
to O
leave O
almost O
unaltered O
the O
average O
presence O
of O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
different O
sectors O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
life O
. O

The O
pressure O
exerted O
by O
the O
rightist O
parties B-TER
and O
the O
repercussions O
from O
the O
international O
situation O
prompted O
the O
second O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O
December O
1938 O
, O
whose O
fundamental O
principles O
are O
derived O
from O
the O
Italian B-LOC
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
law I-TER
of O
10th O
November O
1939 O
[ O
sic O
! O
, O
actually O
1938 O
] O
and O
which O
, O
in O
determining O
the O
definition O
of O
Jew B-TER
according O
to O
fundamentally O
racial O
criteria O
, O
contains O
– O
numerous O
exceptions O
notwithstanding O
– O
severe O
measures O
. O

The O
law B-TER
reduces O
voting O
rights O
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
excludes O
Jews B-TER
from O
the O
Lower O
Chamber O
; O
limits O
the O
presence O
of O
Jews B-TER
in O
secondary O
schools O
, O
in O
universities O
and O
in O
professional O
associations O
to O
6 O
% O
, O
excludes O
Jews B-TER
from O
the O
editorship O
of O
dailies O
and O
periodicals O
, O
from O
the O
directorship O
of O
theatres B-TER
and O
cinemas O
, O
etc O
. O

A O
later O
law B-TER
of O
October O
1941 O
forbade O
marriage B-TER
between O
Jews B-TER
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
and O
punished O
severely O
any O
sexual B-TER
intercourse I-TER
between O
Jewish O
men O
and O
Aryan B-TER
“ O
honest O
women O
” O
. O

Lastly O
, O
after O
further O
measures O
concerning O
implementation O
procedures O
, O
the O
Kállay B-PER
Government O
, O
which O
came O
to O
power O
in O
March O
1942 O
, O
has O
decreed O
the O
confiscation B-TER
of O
all O
Jewish O
landed O
and O
wooded O
property O
( O

and O
the O
definitive O
exclusion O
of O
Jews B-TER
from O
the O
exploitation O
of O
national O
soil O
. O

The O
latest O
decree O
of O
considerable O
importance O
is O
the O
one O
approved O
by O
the O
Chamber O
on O
1st O
May O
, O
which O
rules O
that O
as O
from O
that O
date O
the O
Jewish B-TER
persuasion O
ceases O
to O
be O
officially O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
state I-LOC
. O

Some O
facts O
emerge O
from O
what O
has O
been O
said O
here O
that O
place O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
in O
its O
true O
perspective O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
main O
factor O
that O
encouraged O
the O
Jewish B-TER
invasion O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
is O
still O
far O
from O
having O
vanished O
needs O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
absence O
, O
in O
the O
social O
structure O
of O
this O
Country O
, O
of O
an O
urban O
middle O
class O
that O
might O
carry O
out O
the O
functions O
and O
the O
tasks O
that O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

This O
explains O
why O
it O
is O
fairly O
easy O
to O
implement O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
law I-TER
in O
the O
countryside O
, O
where O
the O
aristocracy O
and O
the O
landed O
middle O
classes O
are O
still O
active O
and O
significant O
forces O
, O
whereas O
it O
remains O
difficult O
to O
do O
the O
same O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
particularly O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
immediate O
removal O
, O
supposing O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
, O
of O
all O
Jews B-TER
holding O
managing O
posts O
in O
industry B-TER
, O
commerce O
and O
banks B-TER
would O
cause O
a O
crisis O
that O
would O
overwhelm O
the O
Hungarian O
economy O
. O

Only O
by O
gradually O
and O
simultaneously O
inserting O
Hungarian B-LOC
elements O
that O
are O
capable O
of O
occupying B-TER
the O
posts O
at O
present O
held O
by O
Jews B-TER
will O
Hungary B-LOC
be O
able O
to O
face O
the O
actual O
expulsions O
of O
the O
latter O
from O
the O
most O
vital O
hubs O
of O
its O
economic O
structure O
. O

This O
necessity O
highlights O
another O
delicate O
aspect O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
is O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
them O
, O
Hungary B-LOC
can O
not O
do O
without O
the O
, O
albeit O
limited O
, O
cooperation O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
can O
not O
be O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
this O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
part O
of O
its O
population O
and O
as O
to O
the O
influence O
it O
has O
on O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
since O
an O
immediate O
and O
complete O
solution O
of O
the O
problem O
looks O
impossible O
, O
the O
Hungarian O
Government O
intends O
to O
continue O
to O
keep O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
alive O
and O
open O
; O
its O
final O
conclusion O
, O
as O
President O
Kalláy B-PER
said O
in O
his O
latest O
speech O
, O
will O
be O
removal O
outside O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
of O
all O
the O
800,000 O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
the O
Country O
. O

As O
I O
already O
said O
, O
the O
numerous O
mixed B-TER
marriages I-TER
entered O
into O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
served O
them O
well O
in O
strengthening O
their O
position O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
ignored O
that O
in O
joining O
their O
power O
to O
that O
of O
many O
aristocratic O
and O
middle O
class O
families O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Hungary B-LOC
have O
created O
a O
network O
of O
shared O
interests O
and O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
very O
social O
classes O
that O
ought O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

And O
they O
have O
contributed O
not O
a O
little O
to O
the O
spreading O
of O
the O
liberal O
ideology O
, O
which O
in O
this O
Country O
is O
perhaps O
more O
enduring O
than O
in O
others O
. O

The O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
therefore O
poses O
for O
Hungary B-LOC
a O
distressful O
and O
difficult O
problem O
as O
it O
closely O
concerns O
its O
social O
structure O
and O
its O
economic O
organization O
, O
and O
this O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Country O
needs O
all O
its O
energies O
to O
face O
its O
new O
and O
important O
tasks O
. O

This O
explains O
the O
hesitancy O
apparent O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
action I-TER
and O
a O
certain O
scepticism O
displayed O
even O
today O
by O
many O
towards O
the O
effectiveness O
and O
even O
towards O
the O
sincerity O
of O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
policies I-TER
, O
But O
the O
Government O
’s O
will O
to O
advance O
on O
the O
road O
it O
has O
in O
part O
already O
covered O
does O
not O
appear O
in O
doubt O
and O
it O
may O
not O
be O
unnecessary O
to O
point O
out O
that O
considerations O
and O
influences O
of O
an O
international B-TER
nature I-TER
are O
not O
without O
bearing O
on O
this O
will O
. O

Please O
accept O
, O
Sir O
, O
the O
expression O
of O
my O
profound O
respect O
. O
