In O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
like O
in O
all O
other O
cities O
, O
the O
civilian O
Jewish O
population O
was O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
. O

Whilst O
catching O
them O
for O
work B-TER
and O
during O
the O
work B-TER
itself O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
made O
fun O
of O
the O
wretched O
people O
, O
teared B-TER
out I-TER
beards I-TER
of O
Jews O
together O
with O
pieces O
of O
their O
chins O
, O
ridiculed B-TER
them I-TER
, O
kicked O
them O
with O
their O
feet O
. O

In O
this O
, O
the O
humorous B-TER
spirit I-TER
of O
the O
cannibals O
was O
already O
expressed O
. O

It O
was O
their O
entertainment B-TER
, O
their O
pleasure O
. O

I O
came O
across O
such O
facts O
of O
humor O
in O
Poland B-LOC
a O
lot O
. O

In O
general O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
love O
to O
take O
photographs B-TER
, O
i.e. O
to O
stage O
- O
manage O
different O
images O
and O
to O
pronounce O
them O
as O
photo O
- O
documents O
. O

These O
fake O
photographies B-TER
constitute O
a O
dirty O
weapon O
of O
Goebbels B-PER
’ I-PER
propaganda B-TER
. O

In O
front O
of O
my O
eyes O
, O
the O
following O
episode O
took O
place O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
Jews O
were O
rounded O
up O
, O
forced O
to O
wrap O
themselves O
in O
taleysim B-TER
prayer O
shawls O
. O

and O
to O
sway O
. O

A O
photographer B-TER
came O
to O
the O
site O
, O
who O
preserved O
this O
image B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
, O
it O
was O
shown O
around O
abroad O
. O

Why O
was O
this O
done O
? O
First O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prove O
what O
a O
savage O
, O
Asiatic O
people O
the O
Jews O
are O
– O
they O
pray O
in O
taleysim B-TER
and O
sway O
during O
prayers O
like O
madmen O
… O
And O
second O
, O
they O
wanted O
to O
prove O
to O
the O
pious O
, O
tender O
- O
hearted O
Americans B-TER
that O
Jews O
are O
living O
a O
good O
life O
under O
the O
Germans B-TER
– O
they O
are O
allowed O
to O
pray O
as O
much O
as O
they O
want O
… O
Hitler B-PER
’s O
propagandists B-TER
did O
not O
tell O
anyone O
, O
though O
, O
about O
the O
horrific O
fact O
that O
these O
very O
Jews O
who O
they O
had O
first O
taken O
photos B-TER
of O
, O
were O
arranged O
in O
rows O
immediately O
after O
the O
photo B-TER
- I-TER
session I-TER
and O
… O
shot B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

I O
was O
also O
told O
that O
in O
many O
Polish B-TER
shtetlekh O
the O
Germans B-TER
entertained B-TER
themselves O
with O
placing O
rabbis B-TER
on O
wodden B-TER
mares I-TER
in I-TER
the I-TER
middle I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
market I-TER
square I-TER
. O

The O
rabbis B-TER
were O
riding O
, O
dressed O
in O
shtraymlekh B-TER
round O
fur O
hat O
worn O
by O
orthodox O
Jews O
on O
the O
Sabbath O
and O
holidays O
. O

on O
their O
heads O
, O
and O
old O
chassidim O
were O
standing O
beside O
them O
with O
brooms O
in O
their O
hands O
… O
The O
rabbi B-TER
had O
to O
hold O
a O
banner O
in O
his O
hand O
with O
the O
inscription O
: O
We O
, O
the O
damned O
Jews O
, O
wanted O
the O
war O
. O

In O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
this O
equals O
… O
humor O
and O
satire O
. O

And O
here O
we O
have O
another O
example O
for O
their O
bandit O
- O
like O
humor O
. O

One O
day O
, O
an O
old O
acquainted O
Jewish B-TER
lawyer I-TER
was O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
weak O
, O
nearsighted O
man B-TER
. O

So O
he O
was O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
… I-TER
to O
carry B-TER
coals I-TER
from I-TER
one I-TER
spot I-TER
to I-TER
another I-TER
and I-TER
back I-TER
. O

Once O
this O
work O
was O
done O
, O
the O
quartermaster O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
more O
complex O
occupation O
for O
him O
. O

He O
drags O
him O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
four O
- O
story O
building O
and O
forces O
him O
… O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
chimney I-TER
with O
his O
hands O
. O

When O
the O
lawyer B-TER
was O
smeared O
with O
soot O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
, O
a O
photographer B-TER
showed O
up O
unexpectedly O
, O
who O
had O
to O
immortalize B-TER
the I-TER
image I-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
, O
dirty O
as O
he O
was O
, O
was O
placed O
in O
front O
of O
the O
wall O
and O
ordered O
to O
laugh O
… O
– O
You O
should O
laugh O
Jewishly O
! O
– O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
commanded O
. O

The O
tortured B-TER
lawyer B-TER
did O
not O
understand O
what O
to O
laugh O
Jewishly O
means O
. O

So O
the O
quartermaster O
goes O
up O
to O
his O
victim B-TER
, O
sticks O
in O
two O
Aryan O
fingers O
into O
his O
mouth O
, O
rips O
open O
his O
lips O
and O
… O
takes O
a O
picture O
. O

The O
representatives O
of O
the O
chosen O
race O
did O
the O
following O
in O
the O
shtetl O
Włodawa B-LOC
: O
They O
spread O
an O
announcement O
that O
tomorrow O
at O
7 O
am O
sharp O
all O
old O
, O
sick B-TER
and O
disabled B-TER
people I-TER
from O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
are O
summoned O
to O
come O
and O
register B-TER
– O
they O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
sanatorium O
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
, O
at O
7 O
am O
sharp O
, O
approximately O
200 O
men B-TER
come O
and O
register B-TER
. O

They O
are O
all O
disabled B-TER
, O
sick B-TER
and O
old O
people O
. O

They O
were O
arranged O
in O
a O
line O
, O
and O
with O
the O
help O
of O
machine O
guns O
… O
they O
are O
sent O
away O
to O
the O
mentioned O
sanatorium O
, O
from O
which O
no B-TER
one I-TER
ever I-TER
comes I-TER
back I-TER
. O

Their O
humor O
has O
a O
diabolic O
nature O
. O

On O
some O
Friday O
, O
25 O
Jews O
were O
snapped O
up O
for O
work B-TER
in O
broad O
daylight O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
standing O
outside O
guarded O
by O
a O
sentinel O
and O
wait O
. O

They O
wait O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
, O
a O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
exits O
the O
building O
in O
a O
blindingly O
white O
apron O
and O
commands O
that O
one O
Jew O
of O
the O
25 O
shall O
come O
with O
him O
. O

It O
takes O
two O
minutes O
and O
the O
soldier B-TER
comes O
back O
out O
again O
on O
his O
own O
… O
but O
with O
his O
apron O
soaked O
in O
blood O
, O
with O
bloody O
hands O
… O
He O
commands O
a O
second O
Jew O
to O
follow O
him O
immediately O
. O

This O
makes O
a O
terrifying O
impression O
on O
the O
Jews O
. O

They O
go O
cold O
and O
are O
seized O
by O
a O
saddening O
deathly B-TER
fear O
. O

One O
of O
them O
goes O
insane O
on O
the O
spot O
, O
others O
lose O
consciousness O
, O
one O
dies B-TER
there O
from O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

The O
others O
one O
after O
the O
other O
followed O
that O
same O
soldier B-TER
inside O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
the O
only O
thing O
this O
sadistic O
procedure O
consisted O
of O
was O
that O
the O
soldier B-TER
slaughtered O
geese O
and O
he O
called O
upon O
the O
Jews O
to O
pluck O
the O
down O
from O
feathers O
... O
The O
young O
female O
physician B-TER
Sh O
. O

was O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
toilets I-TER
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
with O
her O
hands O
. O

She O
did O
it O
. O

The O
soldier B-TER
was O
not O
pleased O
with O
her O
work B-TER
, O
however O
. O

So O
he O
gives O
her O
a O
bucket O
with O
hydrochloric O
acid O
and O
a O
rag O
and O
orders O
her O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
toilets I-TER
with O
it O
. O

From O
the O
hydrochloric O
acid O
, O
the O
young O
girl B-TER
’s I-TER
hands O
are O
burning O
. O

She O
cries O
bitterly O
… O
Then O
, O
the O
soldier B-TER
takes O
the O
rag O
, O
immerses O
it O
into O
the O
hydrochloric O
acid O
and O
wipes O
off O
the O
physician B-TER
’s I-TER
tears O
with O
it O
… O
together O
with O
her O
eyes O
. O

More O
than O
once O
did O
it O
come O
to O
pass O
that O
I O
as O
well O
as O
hundreds O
of O
unfortunate O
Jews O
had O
to O
walk O
around O
aimlessly O
, O
without O
purpose O
, O
for O
dozens O
of O
kilometres O
because O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Hilterite B-TER
blood O
suckers O
wanted O
. O

For O
them O
, O
it O
was O
a O
game B-TER
, I-TER
a I-TER
spiritual I-TER
pleasure I-TER
, I-TER
an I-TER
entertainment I-TER
, O
and O
we O
felt O
as O
if O
our O
hearts O
were O
falling O
out O
. O

As O
if O
our O
knees O
become O
weak O
. O

And O
the O
more O
tired O
we O
were O
, O
the O
more O
reckless O
their O
state O
was O
, O
all O
the O
more O
they O
ridiculed B-TER
and O
tortured B-TER
us O
. O

When O
we O
were O
running O
( O
in O
their O
language O
this O
is O
called O
gymnastics O
) O
, O
they O
were O
chasing O
us O
with O
sticks O
and O
revolvers O
in O
their O
hands O
. O

They O
were O
very O
violent O
. O

– O
Hop O
- O
hop O
, O
damned O
Jews O
! O
Run O
! O
Run O
! O
* O
* O
* O
On O
a O
cold O
autumn O
day O
, O
we O
drove O
to O
the O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

We O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
bloody O
Hitlerite B-TER
axe O
. O

When O
our O
truck O
travelled O
for O
some O
time O
from O
Radzymin B-LOC
( O
near O
Warsaw B-LOC
) O
, O
three O
armed O
Hitler B-PER
- O
soldiers B-TER
stopped O
us O
. O

– O
Stop O
, O
stand O
still O
! O
– O
They O
were O
screaming O
out O
loud O
. O

Our O
car O
stopped O
. O

– O
Men B-TER
, O
out O
! O
So O
the O
ten O
men B-TER
disembarked O
and O
took O
out O
the O
luggage O
. O

The O
famous O
inspection O
of O
the O
luggage O
started O
. O

They B-TER
immediately I-TER
took I-TER
several I-TER
things I-TER
from I-TER
it I-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
did O
individual O
inspections O
. O

One O
of O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
examines O
me O
. O

Where O
is O
, O
I O
am O
supposed O
to O
tell O
him O
, O
the O
rifle O
which O
I O
hide B-TER
from O
the O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
? O
The O
German B-TER
is O
not O
able O
to O
find O
any O
rifle O
on O
me O
. O

But O
looking O
at O
my O
warm O
coat B-TER
which O
I O
wear O
, O
he O
says O
with O
a O
smile O
: O
– O
You O
are O
cold O
, O
right O
? O
Do O
n’t O
worry O
, O
you O
will O
be O
warm O
soon O
… O
Naturally O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
heard O
this O
, O
I O
got O
very O
warm O
. O

This O
characteristic O
episode O
ended O
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
the O
eldest O
of O
the O
three O
commanded O
that O
we O
place O
our O
things O
on O
the O
car O
while O
we O
stay O
below O
. O

He O
further O
commanded O
the O
driver O
to O
drive O
100 O
metres O
. O

When O
all O
of O
this O
was O
done O
, O
he O
slowly O
took O
out O
a O
gun O
from O
his O
case O
, O
pointed O
at O
us O
and O
suddenly O
barked O
at O
us O
. O

– O
Damned O
Jews O
, O
run O
! O
The O
last O
one O
will O
be O
shot B-TER
! O
And O
ten O
Jews O
, O
grown O
- O
ups O
, O
elderlies O
, O
started O
running O
like O
crazy O
… O
Of O
our O
belongings O
, O
we O
did O
not O
see O
any O
of O
it O
anymore O
, O
of O
course O
… O
We O
were O
nonetheless O
happy O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
from O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
hell O
alive O
... O
