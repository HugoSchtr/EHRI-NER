Measures O
against O
the O
Israelites B-TER
of O
Macedonia O
. O

At O
12 O
midnight O
of O
the O
10th O
inst O
. O

, O
while O
troops O
were O
blocking O
the O
streets O
of O
Skopje B-LOC
, O
groups O
of O
policemen B-TER
began O
to O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
homes O
of O
Israelite B-TER
families O
asking O
them O
to O
pack O
a O
limited O
amount O
of O
baggage O
as O
they O
were O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
set O
up O
in O
the O
warehouses O
of O
the O
tobacco O
depository O
and O
in O
the O
surrounding O
, O
fenced O
- O
in O
land O
. O

At O
6 O
pm O
on O
the O
11th O
the O
street O
blockade O
was O
lifted O
and O
5,000 O
Jews B-TER
had O
already O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
while O
the O
hunt B-TER
for O
the O
few O
who O
had O
managed O
to O
hide O
or O
who O
were O
roaming O
the O
countryside O
intending O
to O
cross O
into O
Albania B-LOC
was O
continuing O
. O

Other O
similar O
police O
operations O
were O
under O
way O
at O
the O
same O
time O
in O
Bitola B-LOC
and O
in O
other O
Macedonian B-LOC
towns O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
Israelite B-TER
there O
being O
taken O
to O
Skopje B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
number O
of O
concentrated B-TER
people I-TER
has O
now O
risen O
to O
over O
9,000 O
. O

The O
lengthy O
examination O
of O
their O
documents B-TER
and O
of O
their O
baggage O
and O
the O
painstaking O
body O
searches O
will O
be O
followed O
, O
reportedly O
within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
by O
deportation B-TER
to O
a O
far O
- O
away O
Country O
, O
that O
it O
is O
believed O
will O
be O
Poland B-LOC
for O
the O
majority O
and O
for O
some O
perhaps O
Belgium B-LOC
or O
Germany B-LOC
. O

It O
has O
been O
a O
blanket O
action O
both O
as O
regards O
people O
and O
as O
regards O
property B-TER
: O
even O
Jews B-TER
of O
extremely O
advanced O
age O
or O
with O
a O
serious O
health O
condition O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
leave O
their O
homes O
and O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
rough O
carts O
, O
while O
their O
homes O
with O
all O
their O
contents O
were O
declared O
State O
property O
and O
even O
what O
little O
they O
had O
been O
allowed O
to O
take O
with O
them O
was O
later O
further O
restricted O
. O

They O
have O
each O
been O
left O
with O
only O
the O
oldest O
garment B-TER
and O
the O
oldest O
shoes O
they O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
, O
and O
the O
search O
for O
gold O
and O
money O
about O
the O
persons O
of O
the O
concentrated B-TER
people I-TER
has O
enabled O
officials O
, O
policemen B-TER
and O
soldiers B-TER
to O
walk O
off O
with O
all O
they O
could O
still O
lay O
their O
hands O
on O
: O
even O
scraps O
of O
soap O
, O
used O
toothbrushes O
and O
almost O
empty O
tubes O
of O
toothpaste O
have O
been O
taken O
away O
from O
these O
unfortunate O
people O
who O
may O
truly O
be O
said O
to O
have O
be O
left O
with O
only O
their O
eyes O
to O
weep O
with O
. O

Added O
to O
the O
worries O
about O
their O
entirely O
uncertain O
future O
and O
to O
the O
pain O
for O
the O
total O
loss O
of O
all O
property B-TER
, O
the O
9,000 O
people O
about O
to O
be O
deported B-TER
face O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
hardships O
that O
are O
inflicted O
on O
them O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
foresight O
or O
to O
mere O
brutality O
. O

The O
most O
basic O
sanitary O
facilities O
, O
which O
at O
first O
were O
lacking O
almost O
entirely O
, O
are O
only O
now O
beginning O
to O
work O
but O
still O
only O
inadequately O
, O
food B-TER
is O
very O
scarce O
and O
unsuitable O
( O
during O
the O
first O
days O
they O
gave O
out O
, O
even O
to O
babies O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O
, O
some O
thin O
bean O
slops O
without O
any O
bread O
) O
, O
the O
guards B-TER
seize O
on O
any O
pretext O
to O
use O
with O
sadistic O
force O
the O
whips O
they O
carry O
, O
while O
the O
crowding O
of O
all O
sorts O
of O
people O
within O
a O
cramped O
space O
renders O
rest O
all O
but O
impossible O
. O

The O
tragic O
but O
logical O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
are O
suicides O
– O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
at O
least O
three O
so O
far O
– O
and O
, O
particularly O
among O
women O
, O
instances O
of O
hysterical O
agitation O
bordering O
on O
insanity O
. O

According O
to O
what O
Bulgarians B-ORG
are O
saying O
, O
the O
total O
elimination O
of O
Israelite B-TER
from O
Macedonia B-LOC
has O
been O
requested O
by O
Germany B-LOC
for O
military O
reasons O
: O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
have O
made O
excellent O
, O
huge O
gains O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
that O
in O
carrying O
it O
out O
the O
have O
displayed O
the O
most O
total O
disregard O
for O
even O
the O
most O
basic O
humanitarian O
principles O
. O

I O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
claim O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
people O
who O
, O
being O
present O
in O
Skopje B-LOC
on O
11th O
March O
and O
having O
seen O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
Israelite O
families O
were O
being O
taken O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
having O
then O
heard O
how O
they O
were O
being O
treated O
, O
have O
not O
felt O
a O
sense O
of O
pity O
for O
those O
thus O
stricken O
and O
of O
deep O
condemnation O
of O
the O
Bulgarian O
authorities O
responsible O
for O
this O
and O
for O
their O
agents O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Italian O
Israelite O
Modiano O
family]and O
the O
families O
of O
Israelites O
who O
are O
Albanian O
nationals O
in O
Skopje B-LOC
and O
have O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
presumably O
9 O
families O
with O
approx O
. O

25 O
members O
, O
I O
have O
already O
reported O
with O
telegram O
no O
. O

409/88 O
of O
the O
14th O
March O
inst O
. O

and O
I O
intend O
to O
report O
further O
. O
