The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
On O
the O
20th O
of O
March O
1944 O
, O
a O
day O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
I O
wanted O
to O
send O
a O
pack O
to O
my O
husband O
who O
was O
in O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
with O
one O
of O
his O
comrades O
, O
who O
spent O
his O
days O
off O
at O
home O
and O
was O
travelling O
back O
the O
same O
day O
. O

I O
asked O
a O
policeman B-TER
whether O
I O
could O
enter O
the O
building O
of O
the O
railway O
station O
. O

He O
politely O
responded O
Just O
come O
in O
, O
and O
he O
right O
away O
put O
me O
in O
the O
line O
of O
other O
captured O
Jews O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
they O
took O
me O
to O
Kistarcsa B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
29th O
of O
April O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

The O
first O
weeks O
in O
Kistarcsa B-LOC
were O
awful O
. O

10 O
- O
12 O
people B-TER
lay O
on O
a O
straw B-TER
mattress I-TER
without O
any O
cover O
or O
provision O
. O

The O
only O
food B-TER
we O
got O
was O
sent O
to O
us O
by O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
National I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Aid I-ORG
Action I-ORG
. O

There O
was O
a O
policeman B-TER
called O
Bakos B-PER
, O
who O
was O
infinitely O
cruel O
to O
us O
. O

He O
destroyed O
us O
mentally O
. O

He O
kept O
telling O
us O
that O
You O
would O
not O
go O
home O
from O
here O
any O
more O
. O

It O
appeared O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
right O
because O
we O
had O
to O
leave B-TER
for O
Auschwitz B-LOC
the O
28th O
of O
April O
. O

There O
were O
78 O
people B-TER
in O
the O
freight O
car O
: O
50 O
women B-TER
and O
28 O
men B-TER
. O

We O
arrived O
after O
a O
day O
of O
travel O
. O

On O
arrival O
, O
they O
asked O
us O
at O
the O
station O
whether O
someone O
was O
sick B-TER
or O
unable O
to O
walk O
. O

Naturally O
, O
many O
volunteered O
. O

They O
were O
sent O
directly O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

In O
those O
days O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
far O
away O
, O
and O
later O
we O
- O
the O
first O
Hungarian B-TER
transport B-TER
– O
built O
the O
rail O
on O
which O
the O
train B-TER
could O
come O
closer O
. O

For O
three O
weeks O
we O
stayed O
in O
a O
so O
- O
called O
quarantine O
before O
I O
got O
into O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
together O
with O
150 O
others O
. O

The O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
used O
to O
open O
the O
luggage O
and O
sort O
out O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
the O
deported B-TER
. O

We O
received O
better O
treatment O
, O
and O
wore O
the O
same O
striped O
clothes B-TER
and O
red O
headscarves B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
here O
around O
four O
months O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
with O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
dead B-TER
people I-TER
. O

We O
found O
documents O
and O
photos O
in O
their O
pockets O
. O

Mentally O
, O
this O
work O
destroyed O
us O
completely O
. O

It O
was O
horrible O
to O
see O
the O
chimneys B-TER
throwing O
out O
fire O
everyday O
, O
and O
to O
see O
the O
pits O
on O
fire O
from O
afar O
. O

Dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
were O
so O
numerous O
that O
the O
crematoria B-TER
did O
not O
have O
the O
capacities O
to O
burn O
them O
all O
so O
they O
burnt O
people B-TER
also O
in O
pits O
out O
in O
the O
open O
. O

There O
were O
transports B-TER
that O
arrived O
during O
the O
night O
and O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
without O
selections B-TER
. O

There O
were O
nights O
when O
they O
burnt O
25,000 O
people B-TER
. O

People B-TER
from O
the O
last O
Hungarian B-TER
transport B-TER
came O
from O
Újpest B-LOC
and O
the O
neighbourhoods O
of O
Pest B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
there O
was O
less O
work B-TER
to O
do O
because O
no O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
so O
the O
Kanadakommando B-ORG
was O
dismissed O
. O

My O
last O
horrible O
memory O
working O
in O
the O
Kanada B-ORG
is O
the O
episode O
when O
men B-TER
, O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
, O
were O
brought O
to O
our O
place O
and O
gassed B-TER
in O
the O
room O
where O
the O
Kanada B-ORG
used O
to O
gas B-TER
clothes B-TER
. O

For O
four O
weeks O
I O
was O
in O
quarantine O
from O
where O
I O
got O
into O
an O
Aussenkommando B-TER
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
an O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
beat O
me O
almost O
to O
death B-TER
with O
no O
apparent O
reason O
only O
because O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O

He O
was O
treading O
on O
me O
, O
kicking O
me O
, O
and O
he O
broke O
three O
of O
my O
ribs O
. O

The O
German B-TER
head I-TER
doctor I-TER
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
prepared O
a O
report O
( O
so O
- O
called O
Meldung O
) O
about O
it O
, O
since O
it O
was O
too O
much O
even O
for O
him O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
hospital B-TER
for O
8 O
days O
, O
and O
I O
could O
stay O
another O
week O
in O
the O
block O
for O
the O
convalescent O
. O

Later O
, O
I O
was O
transferred O
into O
the O
commando B-TER
of O
the O
weaving O
mill O
. O

This O
was O
the O
most O
horrible O
. O

If O
we O
did O
not O
weave O
the O
expected O
quantity O
they O
would O
beat O
us O
. O

The O
road O
to O
the O
workplace O
led O
through O
totally O
muddy O
parts O
and O
we O
crossed O
them O
without O
shoes B-TER
and O
warm O
clothes B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
October O
, O
also O
the O
commando B-TER
of O
the O
weaving O
mill O
was O
moved O
into O
Camp B-LOC
C I-LOC
. O

This O
was O
even O
more O
horrible O
because O
the O
rain O
fell O
into O
the O
block O
. O

We O
stood O
there O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
and O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
afterwards O
. O

It O
also O
happened O
that O
they O
were O
disinfecting O
us O
all O
the O
night O
and O
we O
could O
not O
sleep O
at O
all O
but O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
all O
the O
same O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
kitchen O
moved O
and O
it O
meant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
get O
a O
bite O
of O
food B-TER
from O
Sunday O
noon O
till O
Wednesday O
evening O
. O

They O
said O
it O
was O
a O
punishment O
but O
we O
never O
found O
out O
for O
what O
. O

When O
they O
wanted O
to O
make O
Aryan B-TER
people O
work O
in O
the O
weaving O
mill O
the O
Jews O
were O
dismissed O
and O
I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
a O
transport B-TER
the O
29th O
of O
November O
. O

They O
took O
me O
to O
St. B-LOC
Gheorgenthal I-LOC
, O
where O
I O
worked B-TER
for O
an O
aircraft O
parts O
plant O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
there O
were O
only O
200 O
people O
working B-TER
there O
guarded O
by O
10 O
Aufseherins B-TER
. O

These O
Aufseherins B-TER
were O
quite O
nice O
when O
compared O
to O
those O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

When O
Russians B-ORG
approached O
us O
they O
brought O
here O
prisoners B-TER
from O
various O
camps B-TER
, O
and O
also O
the O
SS B-TER
came O
with O
them O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
life O
became O
hell O
also O
here O
. O

They O
would O
keep O
beating O
us O
. O

We O
dug O
trenches O
, O
and O
they O
forced O
us O
to O
get O
prepared O
to O
counter O
the O
enemy O
. O

On O
the O
20th O
of O
December O
, O
I O
fell O
sick B-TER
with O
pneumonia B-TER
and O
typhus B-TER
that O
had O
an O
effect O
later O
also O
on O
my O
legs O
. O

The O
9th O
of O
May O
, O
the O
Russians B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

I O
spent O
another O
two O
weeks O
in O
hospital B-TER
before O
I O
came O
home O
. O
