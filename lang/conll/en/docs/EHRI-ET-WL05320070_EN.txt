In O
the O
bombardment O

eight O

In O

as O
I O
already O
said O
, O
I O

I O
went O
to O
the O
newspaper B-TER
distributor O
Yankev B-PER
Opfal I-PER
. O

The O
writer O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
could O
also O
be O
found O
among O
the O
refugees B-TER
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
who O
were O
stranded O
in O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
he O
was O
extremely O
agitated O
throughout O
. O

He O
constantly O
imagined O
that O
it O
was O
now O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
catch O
him O
. O

His O
panic O
fear O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
originated O
from O
an O
event O
he O
lived O
through O
in O
the O
World O
War B-TER
of O
1914 O
. O

Then O
, O
he O
was O
in O
Kalisz B-LOC
, O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
captured O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
woefully O
- O
famous O
massacre B-TER
of O
Kalisz B-LOC
, O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
shot B-TER
hundreds O
of O
people O
, O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
was O
also O
among O
those O
who O
the O
Germans B-TER
selected O
for O
execution B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
arranged O
a O
group O
of O
people O
and O
picked O
every O
tenth O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
– O
Horontshik B-PER
was O
the O
eleventh O
. O

Due O
to O
his O
great O
agitation O
, O
he O
paralyzed O
at O
once O
. O

He O
lost O
his O
ability O
to O
speak O
. O

Through O
the O
years O
, O
he O
recovered O
, O
but O
all O
along O
there O
remained O
blemish O
– O
a O
constant O
stutter O
. O

The O
memory O
of O
those O
days O
constantly O
tortured B-TER
him O
. O

In O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
, O
on O
Friday O
at O
night O
, O
September O
8 O
, O
1939 O

Horontshik B-PER

Moment O

Yanovski I-PER
and O
agitatedly O
he O
proclaimed O
: O
Yanovski O
, O
they O
will O
slaughter O
us O
undecipherable O
. O

Yanovski B-PER
tried O
to O
calm O
him O
but O
Horontshik B-PER
immediately O
went O
away O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O

Shabbat O
, O
September O
9 O
, O
at O
noon O
, O
Yanovski B-PER
was O
called O
upon O
to O
identify O
a O
corpse B-TER
that O
was O
laying O
in O
a O
small O
room O
in O
the O
[ O
... O
] O
house O
from O
[ O

Yanovski B-PER
immediately O
identified O
the O
corpse B-TER
to O
be O
Shimen B-PER
Horontshik I-PER
– O
his O
neck O
was O
cut O
with O
a O
razor O
. O

In O
the O
corpse B-TER
’s B-TER
pockets O
, O
they O
found O
sixteen O
hundred O
Złotys O
in O

, O
a O
golden O
watch O

and O
a O
written O
testament O
( O
the O
testament O
stayed O

H. B-PER

. O

In O
his O
will O
, O
Horontshik B-PER
writes O
that O
he O
got O
fed O
up O
with O
life O
and O
gives O
instructions O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
remaining O
money O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
he O
wanted O
the O
money O
to O
be O
distributed O
as O
follows O
: O
Three O
hundred O
Złoty O
for O
the O
burial B-TER
and O
a O
tombstone O
, O
three O
hundred O
Złoty O
to O
Yiddish O
secular O
schools B-TER
; O
three O
hundred O
Złoty O
to O
the O
YIVO B-ORG
; O
and O
the O
rest O
should O
be O
sent O
to O
his O
family B-TER
in O
Paris B-LOC

The O
burial B-TER
took O
place O
on O
Sunday O

at O
the O

, O
the O

the O
writer B-TER

I O
myself O
did O
not O
attend O
the O
burial B-TER

Before O
I O
arrived O
in O
Kałuszyn B-LOC

the O
city B-LOC
itself O
had O
not O
suffered O
yet O
. O

The O
city B-LOC
was O
besieged O
by O
refugees B-TER
. O

The O
local O
Jews O
were O
living O
in O
fear O

A O
rumor O
was O
circulating O
that O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
will O
be O
occupied O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
even O
before O
Warsaw B-LOC

As O
I O
learned O
later O
on O
, O
Kałuszyn B-LOC
was O
bombarded O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
on O
Monday O
, O
September O
11 O

The O
city B-LOC

completely O

a O

During O

the O

attacked O

by O
the O

) O
We O
arrived O
in O

after O
German B-TER

had O
bombarded O
the O
city B-LOC

In O
the O
city B-LOC

we O
almost O
only O

only O
a O

The O
greater O
part O
of O

left O
the O

some O
were O
hiding B-TER

. O

The O

were O
open O

there O
were O
no O

Also O
the O
private O
apartments O
were O
abandoned O

Who O
wanted O
could O
take O
whatever O
his O

We O
saw O

When O

With O
the O

almost O
the O
whole O

in O

the O
Jewish O

All O

went O
up O

There O
were O

not O

The O
mood O
was O
tensed O

We O
inquired O
whether O
the O
urban B-LOC
administration I-LOC
was O
still O
there O
or O
whether O
it O
had O
already O
left O
. O

( O
Several O

left O

returned O

Sosnowica B-LOC

a O
small O
shtetele B-LOC

roughly O
sixty O
Jewish O
families B-TER

intact O

The O
shtetl B-LOC

overcrowded O

In O
Sosnowica B-LOC
, O
I O
rested O
for O
one O
day O
and O
on O
September O
15 O
, O
1939 O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
go O
back O

Warsaw B-LOC

B. O
From O
Sosnowica B-LOC
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
From O
Włodawa B-LOC
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
refugees B-TER
streamed O
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

This O
return O
current O
was O
not O
smaller O
than O
the O
one O
that O
streamed O
to O
Włodawa B-LOC
. O

The O
reason O
of O
the O
stream O
backwards O
was O
that O
in O
Włodawa B-LOC
was O
a O
hunger B-TER
crisis O
and O
high O
prices O
. O

Bread B-TER
costed O
, O
so O
it O
was O
told O

fifteen O

Again O
, O
a O
rumor O
circulated O
that O
generally O
the O
Germans B-TER
do O
not O
have O
armed O
, O
organized O
forces O
in O
Poland B-TER
; O
there O
are O
only O
groups O
of O
divisionary O
agents O
and O
small O
military B-TER
units I-TER
; O
the O
route O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
open O
; O
only O
air O
raids O
are O
a O
great O
concern O
, O
and O
one O
is O
nowhere O
safe O
from O
them O
. O

This O
was O
confirmed O
to O
me O
from O
the O
Polish B-TER
military B-TER
authorities I-TER
and O
they O
advised O
me O
to O
return O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC

In O

a O
small O
shtetl B-LOC
with O
a O
few O
dozen O
Jewish O
families B-TER

the O
market O
square O
was O
filled O
with O
refugees B-TER
who O
were O
on O
their O
way O
back O
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

They O
lingered O
there O
and O
were O
afraid O
of O
moving O
on O
, O
because O
they O
found O
out O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
are O
located O
in O
the O
neighboring O
shtetlekh O
Garwolin B-LOC
, O
Żelechów B-LOC

that O
it O

A O
Christian B-TER
, O
who O
had O
escaped O
this O
detention B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
told O
me O
that O
the O
relationship O
of O
Germans B-TER
to O
the O
Jewish O
population O
was O
a O
lot O
worse O
than O
to O
the O
Christian B-TER
one O
. O

They O
did O
not O
let O
Jews O
have O
any O
food B-TER
, O
for O

. O

The O

save O
the O
Torah B-TER
scrolls I-TER
the O
Germans B-TER
would O

, O
so O
he O
burnt B-TER

In O

their O
shtetl B-LOC

the O
German B-TER

I O

In O
the O

His O

between O
Sobolew B-LOC

Łaskarzew B-LOC
( O
the O
distance O
7 O
kilometers O
in O

, O
we O
bumped O
into O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
( O
among O
them O
even O
small O
children B-TER

who O
were O
walking O
famished O
from O
Łaskarzew B-LOC

Sobolew B-LOC
in O
order O
to O
buy O
bread B-TER

These O
Jews O
told O
us O
: O
For O
three O
days O
, O
they O
did O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
because O
the O
mills O

had O
been O
burnt O
down O

In O

The O
Polish B-TER

units I-TER
entrenched O
themselves O
in O
the O
Jewish O
houses O

held O
back O
the O
German B-TER
attack O
. O

When O
they O
entered O
the O
city O
afterwards O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
blamed O
the O
Jews O
to O
have O
shot B-TER
from O
the O
houses O
. O

And O
for O
this O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
shot B-TER
the O
sixty O
Jews O
and O
destroyed O
the O
shtetl B-LOC
( O
they O
simply O
doused O
the O

ignited O
them O

in O
the O

7 O
) O
We O
stopped O
in O
a O

not O

Jeziory I-LOC
because O
, O
as O
we O
got O

struck O
by O
a O

The O

time O

we O
heard O
loud O
and O
clear O
the O
bombardments O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
we O
saw O
the O
fires O
. O

The O
wind O
carried O
away O
the O
many O
burnt O
papers O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
to O
Otwock B-LOC
; O
on O
some O
, O
one O

still O
read O
the O
[ O
names O
of O
the O
] O
companies O
from O
which O
they O
originated O
. O

And O
we O
used O

orientate O
ourselves O
