The O

were O
accommodated B-TER
in O
the O
brewery O
. O

They O
were O
beaten O
all O

time O
; O
the O

used O

variety O
of O
torments O
to O
force O
them O
to O
confess O
where O
they O
had O
hidden B-TER
their I-TER
valuables I-TER

My O

much O
that O
they O
took O
him O

These O
torments O
were O
executed O
by O
people O

Budapest B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
dressed O
like O
civilians O
. O

Once O
there O
was O
a O
looting O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
when O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
took O
away O
every O
valuable O
, O
watches O
and O
food O
from O
us O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
only O
one O
knapsack O
with O
us O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
and O
they O
said O
if O
they O
find O
money O
on O
somebody O
, O
they O
would O
shoot B-TER
down I-TER
10 O
Jews O
for O
it O
. O

They B-TER
put I-TER
80 I-TER
people I-TER
in I-TER
a I-TER
cattle I-TER
car I-TER
, O
a O
small O
jug O
of O
water O
and O
a O
bucket O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
toilet O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
5th O
July O
, O
after O
5 O
days O
of O
travelling O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
water O
on O
the O
way O
in O
Debrecen B-LOC
and O
Kassa B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
get O
off O
. O

In O
Kassa B-LOC
, O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
searched O
the O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
they O
took O
away O
everything O
we O
still O
had O
: O
money O
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
blankets O
, O
shoes O
, O
etc O
. O

SS B-TER
soldiers O
took O
over O
in O
Kassa B-LOC
and O
one O
of O
them O
addressed O
a O
speech O
to O
us O
saying O
that O
we O
should O
not O
be O
afraid O
, O
because O
we O
would O
work B-TER
and O
he O
who O
works B-TER
would O
receive O
food B-TER
. O

Our O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
was O
horrible O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
the O
evening O
in O
heavy O
rain O
and O
we O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
very O
quickly O
. O

They O
told O
us O
to O
leave O
our O
baggage O
there O
, O
they O
would O
take O
it O
after O
us O
. O

They O
selected B-TER
us O
immediately O
. O

They O
bathed O
us O
in O
hot O
water O
and O
put O
a O
single O
ragged O
dress B-TER
on O
us O
, O
then O
they O
chased O
us O
in O
an O
enormous O
toilet O
building O
where O
we O
were O
terribly O
cold O
after O
the O
hot O
bath O
, O
standing O
on O
cold O
stone O
ground O
in O
a O
single O
dress O
at O
night O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
us O
were O
crammed O
there O
and O
we O
were O
terribly O
tired O
, O
we O
could O
not O
even O
sit O
down O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
died I-TER
there O
that O
night O
. O

On O
the O
next O
day O
they O
made O
us O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
they O
put O
our O
names O
down O
and O
put O
together O
a O
transport B-TER
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
they O
sent O
us O
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

From O
there O
they O
took O
500 O
of O
us O
to O
a O
village O
called O
Urbe B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
cut B-TER
down I-TER
a I-TER
forest I-TER
and O
built B-TER
a I-TER
railway I-TER
. O

For O
us O
women B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
was O
terribly O
hard O
. O

I O
had O
to O
carry O
beams O
, O
so O
heavy O
that O
my O
neck O
became O
twice O
thicker O
and O
it O
will O
have O
to O
be O
operated O
on O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
a O
camp O
in O
Urbe B-LOC
, O
14 O
of O
us O
slept O
in O
a O
tent O
on O
the O
bare O
ground O
. O

We O
picked O
moss O
in O
the O
forest O
; O
that O
was O
our O
pillow O
. O

Our O
provisions B-TER
consisted O
of O
some O
soup B-TER
once O
a O
day O
and O
half O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
later O
only O
one O
quarter O
of O
a O
loaf B-TER
. I-TER

Very O
few O
people B-TER
survived O
the O
hard O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
they O
took O
me O
with O
a O
transport B-TER
to O
Magdeburg B-LOC
. O

There O
I O
worked B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
in O
an O
ammunition B-TER
factory I-TER
. O

I O
worked B-TER
one O
day O
at O
daytime O
, O
on O
the O
other O
day O
at O
night O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
not O
hard O
, O
only O
the O
workday O
was O
very O
long O
and O
the O
night O
shift O
was O
especially O
difficult O
to O
endure O
. O

They O
did O
not O
harm O
us O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
civilian O
overseers B-TER
sometimes O
gave O
extra O
food B-TER
to O
a O
woman B-TER
. O

However O
, O
I O
had O
already O
been O
so O
weakened O
by O
then O
that O
sometimes O
I O
could O
hardly O
walk O
. O

That O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
prior O
events O
and O
the O
overwork O
. O

When O
the O
American B-TER
were O
coming O
closer O
to O
Magdeburg B-LOC
, O
soldiers B-TER
from O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
took O
us O
to O
a O
village O
called O
Nedlitz B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
everything O
there O
and O
we O
had O
to O
march O
very O
fast O
. O

They O
put O
down O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
on O
a O
square O
. O

Later O
we O
learned O
that O
square O
was O
an O
airport O
and O
there O
was O
an O
air O
raid O
that O
night O
, O
on O
account O
of O
which O
about O
4,000 O
people B-TER
died B-TER
. I-TER

The O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
soldiers O
had O
escaped O
from O
us O
before O
the O
air O
raid O
and O
those O
who O
survived O
met O
the O
American B-TER
troops O
already O
on O
the O
next O
day O
. O

One O
of O
my O
most O
terrible O
experiences O
was O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

A O
woman B-TER
of O
about O
50 O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
her O
daughter B-TER
at O
the O
selection B-TER
. O

Then O
an O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
began O
to O
hit O
her O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
was O
already O
quite O
beside O
herself O
and O
she O
hit O
the O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
back O
. O

Then O
the O
SS B-TER
woman I-TER
took O
a O
dog O
whip O
and O
looped O
it O
around O
the O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
neck O
and O
she O
dragged O
her O
like O
that O
along O
the O
whole O
long O
way O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
’s I-TER
screaming O
was O
horrible O
and O
unforgettable O
. O

When O
she O
was O
barely O
alive O
, O
two O
other O
SS B-TER
soldiers O
shot O
at O
her O
. O

The O
corpse B-TER
was O
left O
before O
us O
all O
the O
time O
, O
so O
that O
we O
learn O
from O
the O
case O
, O
because O
that O
is O
what O
happens O
to O
those O
who O
contradict O
them O
. O

The O
suffering O
of O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
mine O
, O
a O
young O
girl B-TER
, O
was O
also O
terrible O
; O
they O
took O
her O
insulin O
away O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
so O
she O
died B-TER
there O
, O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O
