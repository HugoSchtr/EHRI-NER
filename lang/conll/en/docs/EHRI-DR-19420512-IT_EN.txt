The O
law B-TER
- I-TER
decree I-TER
of O
30th O
April O
1941 O
must O
be O
considered O
together O
with O
the O
other O
decree B-TER
instituting O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
which O
delivers O
opinions O

offers O
suggestions O

all O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
racial O
status O
is O
in O
doubt O

and O
with O
the O
other O
, O
On O
the O
Protection O
of O
Aryan O
Blood O
and O
the O
Honour O
of O
the O
Croatian O
People O
, O
which O
absolutely O
forbids O
marriage O
between O
Jews B-TER
or O
persons O
not O
belonging O
to O
the O
Aryan B-TER
race O
and O
persons O
of O
the O
Aryan B-TER
race I-TER

punishes O
with O
great O
severity O
extramarital O
relations O
between O
the O
Jew B-TER
or O
a O
person O
not O
of O
Aryan B-TER
blood O
and O
female O
persons O
of O
Aryan B-TER
origin I-TER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
legislative O
measures O
there O
is O
also O
a O
body O
of O
police O
regulations O
concerning O
Jews B-TER
, O
the O
main O
being O
: O
Jews B-TER
are O
banned O
from O
living O
in O
certain O
parts O
of O
town O
their O
personal O
property O
is O
confiscated O
without O
compensation O
they O
are O
forbidden O
to O
keep O
radios O
and O
telephones O
male O
Jews O
aged O
from O
16 O
to O
60 O
must O
have O
themselves O
entered O
in O
special O
registers O
they O
must O
all O
, O
irrespective O
of O
age O
and O
gender O
, O
wear O
a O
special O
badge O
on O
the O
chest O
and O
on O
the O
back O
they O
must O
observe O
a O
special O
curfew O
they O
are O
forbidden O
to O
loiter O
in O
the O
streets O
in O
the O
city O
centre O
, O
and O
may O
only O
pass O
through O
they O
are O
banned O
from O
entering O
public O
establishments O
, O
etc O
. O

Having O
thus O
determined O
the O
legal O
status O
of O
persons O
belonging O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
race I-TER
, O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
settle O
all O
attendant O
economic O
matters O
. O

A O
first O
step O
was O
therefore O
to O
declare O
null O
and O
void O
all O
contracts O
entered O
into O
between O
Jews O
and O
between O
Jews O
and O
others O
in O
the O
60 O
days O
preceding O
the O
declaration O
of O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia B-LOC
, O
if O
the O
value O
of O
the O
contract O
was O
over O
100,000 O
Dinars O
and O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
subsequently O
approved O
by O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Justice O
. O

Almost O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
law B-TER
- I-TER
decree I-TER
was O
issued O
whereby O
all O
businesses O
that O
were O
entirely O
or O
partially O
owned O
by O
Jews B-TER
as O
well O
as O
those O
in O
which O
one O
or O
more O
Jews O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
Board O
of O
Directors O
or O
had O
managerial O
posts O
were O
considered O
Jewish O
. O

That O
same O
decree O
ordered O
Jews O
, O
persons O
of O
Aryan B-TER
origin I-TER
joined O
in O
matrimony O
with O
Jews O
, O
foreign O
Jews O
who O
were O
on O
Croatian O
territory O
as O
of O
5th O
June O
1941 O
and O
Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
to O
report O
their O
assets O
as O
well O
as O
all O
changes O
of O
ownership O
that O
had O
occurred O
after O
10th O
February O
1941 O
. O

With O
this O
decree O
any O
alienation O
of O
Jewish B-TER
property I-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
transfer O
of O
Jewish O
businesses O
, O
of O
stocks O
, O
of O
shares O
in O
consortia O
and O
other O
property O
rights O
was O
made O
impossible O
, O
since O
any O
contract O
of O
whatever O
kind O
required O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
. O

Jewish O
businesses O
thus O
confiscated O
by O
the O
State O
might O
be O
managed O
by O
the O
State O
itself O
, O
or O
be O
either O
leased O
, O
sold O
or O
liquidated O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
Treasury O
. O

The O
final O
decision O
in O
all O
these O
cases O
lies O
with O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
. O

Lastly O
, O
with O
the O
Decree O
of O
10th O
October O
1941 O
, O
the O
authority O
on O
all O
matters O
concerning O
the O
estates O
of O
individual O
Jews B-TER
or O
of O
Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
has O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
which O
may O
, O
with O
a O
discretionary O
decision O
that O
admits O
no O
recourse O
, O
nationalize O
the O
assets O
of O
any O
Jew B-TER
as O
well O
as O
of O
any O
Jewish O
business O
and O
determine O
what O
compensation O
, O
if O
any O
, O
shall O
be O
paid O
and O
how O
. O

The O
estates O
thus O
acquired O
can O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
or O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
. O

Recently O
this O
Department O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
have O
been O
eliminated O
and O
all O
authority O
in O
matters O
concerning O
Jewish O
economic O
questions O
and O
the O
assessment O
of O
race O
has O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
Office O
for O
Nationalized O
Assets O
, O
and O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
Affairs O
respectively O
. O

The O
implementation O
of O
all O
these O
measures O
has O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
been O
very O
easy O
. O

Croatian O
public O
opinion O
, O
being O
insufficiently O
prepared O
for O
a O
racial O
campaign O
and O
still O
wary O
of O
the O
new O
Regime O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
shaken O
by O
a O
string O
of O
illegal O
acts O
carried O
out O
by O
unscrupulous O
Ustashe B-TER
officials I-TER
, O
had O
a O
rather O
negative O
reaction O
against O
these O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
and O
watched O
the O
course O
of O
events O
with O
great O
scepticism O
. O

From O
a O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
, O
which O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
the O
buttress O
of O
the O
entire O
system O
, O
and O
whose O
task O
it O
was O
basically O
to O
centralize O
and O
draw O
up O
an O
inventory O
of O
all O
Jewish B-TER
property I-TER
, O
proved O
decidedly O
inferior O
to O
the O
task O
they O
had O
been O
entrusted O
with O
, O
both O
because O
their O
offices O
were O
disorganized O
and O
because O
its O
officials O
had O
absolutely O
no O
experience O
in O
such O
matters O
. O

This O
state O
of O
affairs O
was O
taken O
advantage O
of O
by O
elements O
of O
the O
German O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
who O
, O
through O
their O
financial O
organizations O
, O
were O
able O
to O
acquire O
legally O
the O
main O
formerly O
Jewish O
businesses O
. O

Lastly O
, O
as O
to O
the O
present O
situation O
of O
Croats B-TER
who O
own O
formerly O
Jewish B-TER
property I-TER
, O
it O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
they O
have O
acquired O
it O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
but O
mainly O
through O
a O
system O
of O
fictitious O
sales O
carried O
out O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
persons O
appointed O
by O
the O
State O
to O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
said O
property O
. O

Of O
the O
40,000 O
Jews O
who O
, O
it O
has O
been O
estimated O
, O
were O
living O
in O
Croatian O
territory O
, O
only O
approx O
. O

6,000 O
are O
left O
, O
almost O
all O
interned O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
or O
assigned O
to O
farm O
work O
or O
to O
land O
reclamation O
. O

Of O
the O
rest O
, O
some O
have O
managed O
to O
emigrate O
and O
some O
must O
be O
considered O
missing O
. O

The O
Jewish O
problem O
can O
therefore O
be O
considered O
virtually O
solved O
in O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia B-TER
; O
a O
few O
issues O
still O
remain O
pending O
, O
such O
for O
instance O
as O
mixed O
marriages O
, O
but O
they O
too O
will O
soon O
be O
dealt O
with O
and O
settled O
. O
