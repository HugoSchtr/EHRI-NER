[ O
... O
] O
Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
characteristic O
of O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
where O
nationality B-TER
is O
a O
matter O
of O
language O
rather O
than O
of O
blood O
, O
that O
speech O
rather O
than O
origin O
is O
the O
distinguishing O
characteristic O
of O
friend O
or O
foe O
. O

Such O
resentment O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
as O
exists O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
thus O
centers O
largely O
on O
the O
German O
- O
speaking O
Jews B-TER
– O
particularly O
those O
who O
have O
come O
to O
Bohemia B-LOC
since O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Among O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
themselves O
, O
there O
is O
comparatively O
little O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitism I-TER
. O

Only O
the O
small O
Czech B-LOC
fascist B-TER
groups I-TER
and O
certain O
sections O
of O
the O
nationalist B-TER
- O
conservative B-TER
element O
are O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
. O

This O
applies O
particularly O
to O
the O
younger O
element O
in O
the O
New B-ORG
National I-ORG
Unity I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
being O
organized O
as O
a O
government B-TER
party B-TER
. O

All O
these O
elements O
together O
, O
however O
, O
make O
up O
only O
a O
small O
minority B-TER
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
population O
. O

The O
mass O
of O
the O
people O
appear O
simply O
to O
have O
very O
little O
interest O
in O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitism I-TER
. O

The O
present O
talk O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
and O
the O
general O
anxiety B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
is O
due O
principally O
to O
the O
pressure O
which O
is O
being O
brought O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Government B-TER
by O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
policy I-TER
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
pressure O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Very O
little O
has O
happened O
in O
Prague B-LOC
thus O
far O
to O
justify O
the O
panicky O
atmosphere O
which O
has O
prevailed O
in O
Jewish B-TER
circles I-TER
here O
since O
the O
Munich O
agreement O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
and O
Moravia B-LOC
have O
remained O
up O
to O
the O
present O
quite O
unmolested O
both O
in O
their O
private O
lives O
and O
their O
economic B-TER
activities O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
Slovakia B-LOC
, O
other O
conditions O
prevail O
. O

Here O
the O
percentage O
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
is O
higher O
than O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
. O

The O
Slovak B-LOC
Jews B-TER
are O
not O
only O
prominent O
in O
the O
cities O
but O
, O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
situation O
prevailing O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
are O
scattered O
in O
large O
numbers O
throughout O
the O
countryside O
and O
play O
a O
conspicuous O
part O
in O
the O
economic B-TER
life I-TER
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
village O
. O

They O
are O
the O
object O
of O
widespread O
resentment O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
population O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
are O
of O
the O
poorer O
orthodox B-TER
type O
. O

Their O
dress B-TER
, O
their O
manners O
and O
their O
habits O
are O
conspicuous O
and O
– O
to O
many O
Slovaks B-LOC
– O
offensive O
. O

They O
are O
prominent O
in O
the O
villages O
as O
money O
- O
lenders O
, O
lawyers B-TER
, O
saloon O
- O
keepers O
, O
druggists O
, O
merchants O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
larger O
cities O
they O
form O
a O
wealthy O
class O
which O
makes O
up O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
intelligentsia O
and O
controls O
a O
very O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
educated O
Jews B-TER
are O
Hungarian B-LOC
-speaking O
and O
have O
always O
looked O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
for O
cultural B-TER
inspiration O
. O

A O
smaller O
but O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
number O
have O
had O
a O
German B-LOC
cultural B-TER
orientation O
. O

This O
doubtless O
explains O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
feeling O
prevalent O
in O
many O
Slovak B-LOC
circles O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
have O
always O
sided O
with O
the O
oppressors O
of O
the O
Slovaks B-LOC
, O
against O
the O
native B-TER
population I-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
As O
will O
have O
been O
seen O
from O
the O
above O
discussion O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
presents O
a O
highly O
confused O
picture O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
themselves O
fall O
into O
many O
different O
categories O
, O
varying O
from O
the O
highly O
cultured B-TER
intellectuals B-TER
of O
Prague B-LOC
to O
the O
pious O
and O
primitive O
orthodox B-TER
Jews B-TER
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
and O
Ruthenian O
villages O
. O

They O
are O
divided O
among O
various O
cultural B-TER
tendencies O
: O
Yiddish O
, O
German B-LOC
, O
Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
. O

The O
attitude B-TER
of O
the O
Aryan B-TER
population O
toward O
them O
varies O
again O
, O
between O
city O
and O
country O
, O
between O
the O
various O
classes O
and O
professions O
, O
between O
the O
different O
provinces O
. O

In O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
is O
scarcely O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
any O
clear O
- O
cut O
policy B-TER
or O
attitude B-TER
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
responsible O
authorities O
will O
emerge O
. O

It O
seems O
evident O
that O
if O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
existed O
in O
a O
vacuum O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
despite O
their O
considerable O
number O
, O
would O
not O
present O
any O
problem O
which O
could O
not O
be O
solved O
with O
relatively O
humane O
and O
painless O
methods B-TER
. O

The O
country O
does O
not O
contain O
in O
itself O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
really O
serious O
and O
widespread O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
semitic I-TER
movement I-TER
. O
