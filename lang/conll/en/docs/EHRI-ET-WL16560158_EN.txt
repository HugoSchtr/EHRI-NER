My O
name O
is O
Renate B-PER
Allais I-PER
( O
maiden O
name O
Lasker B-PER
) O
. O

I O
am O
Jewish O
, O
German B-LOC
by O
birth O
, O
and O
come O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
( O
Wroclaw B-LOC
) O
, O
where O
my O
father O
worked B-TER
as O
a O
lawyer B-TER
at O
the O
regional O
appeal O
court B-TER
. O

Soon O
after O
the O
start O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
I O
was O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

After O
an O
imprisonment B-TER
of O
one O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
and O
reimprisoned B-TER
. O

This O
section O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
called O
Birkenau O
. O

I O
was O
brought O
in O
as O
a O
political B-TER
prisoner B-TER
late O
at O
night O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
, O
which O
covered O
an O
area O
of O
many O
kilometres O
, O
was O
illuminated O
as O
bright O
as O
day O
, O
despite O
the O
war B-TER
. O

An O
SS B-TER
woman B-TER
and O
an O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
with O
two O
large O
Alsatian O
dogs O
beat O
us O
and O
drove O
us O
into O
a O
barracks B-TER
, O
where O
we O
were O
shut O
in O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
shorn O
bald O
and O
I O
was O
tattooed O
with O
the O
number O
70159 O
on O
my O
left O
forearm O
. O

All O
luggage O
and O
valuables O
were O
confiscated B-TER
and O
, O
although O
it O
was O
mid O
- O
December O
and O
icy O
cold O
, O
we O
were O
each O
given O
a O
thin O
dress B-TER
, O
a O
set O
of O
ripped O
summer O
underclothes B-TER
and O
a O
pair O
of O
clogs B-TER
. O

No O
hosiery B-TER
, O
no O
coat B-TER
and O
nothing O
to O
cover O
our O
heads O
. O

After O
only O
a O
few O
steps O
in O
the O
clogs B-TER
, O
my O
feet O
were O
rubbed O
raw O
and O
bleeding B-TER
. O

Like O
all O
other O
newcomers O
, O
I O
was O
put O
in O
quarantine B-TER
barracks I-TER
, O
where O
I O
remained O
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

The O
barracks B-TER
were O
not O
heated O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
beds O
, O
we O
had O
so O
- O
called O
bunks O
, O
which O
were O
a O
sort O
of O
box O
. O

Two O
of O
these O
lay O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
, O
and O
eight O
people B-TER
slept O
in O
each O
. O

For O
eight O
people B-TER
, O
there O
were O
only O
two O
blankets O
. O

Every O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
woken O
at O
4 O
am O
by O
a O
piercing O
whistle O
and O
we O
were O
required O
to O
have O
got O
up O
within O
two O
minutes O
, O
otherwise O
there O
was O
a O
hail O
of O
blows O
. O

At O
quarter O
past O
four O
, O
tea B-TER
or O
sometimes O
some O
sort O
of O
coffee B-TER
was O
shared O
out O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
tried O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
clean O
used O
this O
drink B-TER
to O
wash B-TER
with O
, O
as O
the O
only O
other O
available O
water B-TER
was O
generally O
frozen O
over O
. O

At O
4.30 O
am O
, O
we O
had O
to O
present O
ourselves O
for O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
and O
stand O
completely O
still O
until O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
accounted O
for O
. O

At O
6 O
am O
, O
the O
labour B-TER
battalions I-TER
marched O
out O
. O

We O
quarantine O
prisoners B-TER
did O
not O
go O
out O
to O
work B-TER
and O
we O
attempted O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
warm O
, O
at O
least O
as O
far O
as O
this O
was O
possible O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
not O
to O
be O
noticed O
in O
any O
way O
, O
because O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
labour B-TER
battalions I-TER
had O
left O
, O
the O
selections B-TER
began O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
with O
the O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
( O
a O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
at O
that O
time O
) O
, O
also O
accompanied O
by O
two O
high O
- O
ranking O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
visited O
every O
barrack B-TER
and O
ordered O
the O
prisoners B-TER
to O
report O
to O
them O
. O

We O
had O
to O
undress B-TER
completely O
and O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
we O
were O
selected B-TER
for O
gassing B-TER
due O
to O
any O
of O
the O
following O
reasons O
: O
a O
skin B-TER
rash I-TER
, O
which O
was O
unavoidable O
due O
to O
bugs B-TER
and O
lack B-TER
of I-TER
vitamins I-TER
; O
too O
thin O
; O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
; O
or O
simply O
a O
face O
that O
did O
not O
fit O
. O

Those O
whose O
numbers O
were O
written O
down O
, O
were O
delivered O
by O
the O
block O
elder O
, O
who O
was O
also O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
to O
Block O
Number O
25 O
. O

This O
block O
was O
always O
so O
over O
- O
full O
because O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
were O
so O
overloaded O
that O
many O
who O
had O
been O
selected B-TER
to O
be O
gassed B-TER
had O
to O
wait O
a O
week O
until O
it O
was O
their O
turn O
. O

The O
selected B-TER
victims B-TER
were O
shut O
in O
this O
barrack B-TER
number O
25 O
, O
stark O
naked O
, O
without O
beds O
, O
without O
washing B-TER
facilities I-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
toilets B-TER
in O
any O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
just O
mass O
latrines B-TER
in O
a O
separate O
building O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
of O
number O
25 O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
the O
latrines B-TER
, O
as O
one O
knew O
that O
they O
would O
try O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
their O
panic O
. O

They O
were O
given O
nothing O
to O
drink B-TER
. O

Once O
a O
day O
, O
at O
6 O
pm O
, O
a O
basket O
of O
bread B-TER
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
for O
which O
the O
prisoners B-TER
then O
beat O
each O
other O
half O
dead B-TER
. O

Whenever O
I O
passed O
by O
barrack B-TER
25 O
, O
I O
saw O
arms O
stuck O
out O
of O
the O
barred O
windows O
and O
heard O
whimpering O
voices O
, O
begging B-TER
for O
water B-TER
. O

Mind O
you O
, O
all O
of O
those O
selected B-TER
for O
gassing B-TER
inside O
the O
camp B-TER
knew O
exactly O
what O
was O
happening O
. O

In O
contrast O
were O
the O
big O
transports B-TER
that O
rolled O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
every O
single O
day O
, O
although O
most O
of O
them O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
as O
well O
, O
they O
were O
at O
least O
spared O
the O
agony O
of O
knowing O
that O
they O
were O
facing O
certain O
death B-TER
. O

In O
their O
case O
, O
it O
took O
place O
in O
the O
following O
way O
: O
the O
cattle B-TER
trucks I-TER
rolled O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
wagons B-TER
were O
opened O
, O
the O
dead B-TER
were O
brought O
out O
, O
as O
most O
of O
these O
trains B-TER
were O
underway O
for O
several O
days O
and O
contained O
many O
elderly O
people B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
, O
together O
with O
other O
SS B-TER
officers I-TER
, O
and O
the O
female B-TER
camp I-TER
commanders B-TER
mustered O
all O
of O
the O
incomers O
and O
sorted O
them O
according O
to O
the O
following O
criteria O
: O
young O
, O
healthy B-TER
-looking O
men B-TER
to O
one O
side O
; O
older O
people B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
those O
who O
looked O
ill B-TER
or O
pale O
to O
the O
other O
. O

Amongst O
the O
women B-TER
, O
all O
of O
those O
who O
came O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
with O
children B-TER
were O
put O
onto O
the O
same O
side O
as O
the O
older O
and O
ill B-TER
-looking O
men B-TER
. O

A O
small O
batch O
were O
then O
led O
into O
camp B-TER
under O
SS B-TER
guard B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
shorn O
, O
tattooed O
and O
completely O
undressed B-TER
and O
then O
incorporated O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

All O
of O
the O
others O
were O
led O
directly O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

They O
were O
told O
they O
were O
going O
to O
be O
bathed B-TER
, O
and O
were O
urged O
to O
tie O
their O
clothes B-TER
together O
well O
, O
so O
that O
they O
could O
find O
them O
again O
after O
their O
wash B-TER
. O

After O
they O
were O
undressed B-TER
, O
they O
were O
brought O
into O
a O
vast O
room O
and O
, O
when O
it O
was O
bulging O
full O
, O
it O
was O
locked O
shut O
. O

Then O
the O
gas B-TER
was O
let O
in O
and O
, O
after O
terrible O
agony O
, O
they O
would O
die B-TER
in O
approximately O
ten O
minutes O
. O

I O
am O
reporting O
this O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
knowledge O
and O
conscience O
, O
although O
I O
was O
obviously O
never O
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
myself O
. O

However O
, O
I O
knew O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
special O
unit O
( O
Sonderkommando B-TER
) O
. O

Once O
, O
he O
smuggled B-TER
himself O
into O
the O
womens B-TER
’ I-TER
camp I-TER
under O
a O
pretext O
and O
told O
me O
about O
his O
work B-TER
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
consisted O
solely O
of O
Jews O
who O
were O
forced O
to O
do O
this O
work B-TER
. O

They O
did O
all O
of O
the O
work B-TER
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
apart O
from O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
gas B-TER
, O
which O
was O
left O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

It O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
to O
sort O
out O
the O
corpses B-TER
after O
the O
gassing B-TER
, O
which O
were O
stuck O
to O
each O
other O
in O
wild O
convolutions O
after O
their O
agonising O
death B-TER
throes O
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
then O
had O
to O
break O
all O
gold O
teeth O
out O
of O
the O
corpses B-TER
and O
they O
were O
also O
responsible O
for O
the O
incineration B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
bodies I-TER
. O

Members O
of O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
were O
strictly O
separated O
from O
the O
ordinary O
prisoners B-TER
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
barrack B-TER
and O
were O
treated O
unusually O
well O
for O
the O
duration O
of O
their O
work B-TER
. O

They O
were O
given O
as O
much O
food B-TER
and O
alcohol B-TER
and O
as O
many O
cigarettes O
as O
they O
wanted O
. O

However O
, O
every O
six O
months O
they O
had O
to O
go O
the O
same O
way O
as O
those O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
burn B-TER
. O

The O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
was O
changed O
over O
every O
six O
months O
, O
to O
avoid O
the O
danger O
of O
any O
survivors B-TER
remaining O
after O
the O
war B-TER
who O
would O
be O
able O
to O
give O
eyewitness O
accounts O
of O
their O
work B-TER
. O

In O
the O
late O
autumn O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
special B-TER
unit I-TER
who O
had O
prepared O
themselves O
to O
be O
killed B-TER
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
, O
decided O
to O
riot B-TER
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
unsuccessful O
and O
the O
result O
was O
that O
they O
were O
all O
shot B-TER
whilst O
trying O
to O
break B-TER
out I-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Two O
weeks O
after O
my O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
I O
was O
taken O
ill B-TER
with O
spotted B-TER
fever I-TER
, O
an O
illness B-TER
that O
was O
rife O
every O
winter O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
could O
not O
be O
fought O
off O
, O
because O
we O
were O
all O
completely O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
and O
the O
germs O
spread O
themselves O
through O
the O
lice B-TER
. O

I O
was O
marked O
down O
for O
gassing B-TER
twice O
, O
but O
was O
saved O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
both O
times O
. O

The O
first O
time O
was O
because O
my O
sister O
, O
who O
belonged O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
orchestra B-TER
, O
appealed O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
who O
had O
a O
weakness O
for O
music B-TER
and O
the O
second O
time O
because O
one O
of O
the O
selection B-TER
officers O
( O
Hessler B-PER
) O
, O
who O
incidentally O
has O
since O
been O
executed B-TER
in O
Hamelin B-LOC
( O
Hameln B-LOC
) O
, O
was O
humane O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
crossed O
out O
my O
name O
again O
. O

There O
was O
no O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
available O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
there O
was O
no O
medicine B-TER
. O

The O
few O
medicines B-TER
, O
that O
were O
smuggled B-TER
under O
great O
danger O
by O
the O
prisoners B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
warehouses O
, O
were O
only O
obtainable O
if O
one O
had O
a O
valuable O
means O
of O
barter B-TER
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
typhus B-TER
, O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
chronic O
dysentery B-TER
, O
an O
illness B-TER
that O
claimed O
more O
lives O
than O
the O
typhus B-TER
. O

We O
all O
suffered O
from O
open O
, O
festering O
wounds B-TER
on O
our O
whole O
bodies O
, O
because O
of O
the O
complete O
lack B-TER
of I-TER
vitamins I-TER
in O
our O
diet B-TER
. O

Our O
nutrition B-TER
consisted O
of O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
which O
was O
shared O
out O
in O
the O
evenings O
and O
had O
to O
be O
sufficient O
until O
the O
next O
evening O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
bowl O
of O
nondescript O
soup B-TER
, O
in O
which O
a O
few O
chunks O
of O
turnip B-TER
swam O
. O

Absolutely O
no O
fruit B-TER
, O
nor O
vegetables B-TER
. O

Hard O
workers B-TER
received O
a O
3 O
cm O
long O
piece O
of O
black O
pudding B-TER
and O
a O
tiny O
piece O
of O
cheese B-TER
twice O
a O
week O
. O

Saltpetre O
was O
also O
cooked O
in O
the O
soup O
to O
prevent O
the O
women B-TER
from O
menstruating O
. O

None O
of O
the O
female B-TER
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
dependent O
on O
the O
food B-TER
provided O
by O
the O
camp B-TER
ever O
got O
their O
period O
. O

After O
four O
weeks O
of O
quarantine O
, O
I O
was O
brought O
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
and O
assigned O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
work B-TER
consisted O
mainly O
of O
carrying O
stones O
and O
shovelling O
clay O
, O
as O
well O
as O
loading O
and O
unloading O
waggons B-TER
. O

We O
worked B-TER
eleven O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
with O
a O
ten O
minute O
break O
at O
midday O
, O
when O
we O
were O
given O
a O
bowl O
of O
soup B-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
spoons O
and O
the O
soup B-TER
was O
so O
hot O
, O
that O
we O
were O
often O
unable O
to O
eat B-TER
it O
in O
the O
time O
available O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
guarded B-TER
the O
entire O
time O
whilst O
we O
were O
working B-TER
by O
the O
SS B-TER
with O
dogs O
, O
which O
they O
released O
on O
us O
, O
if O
we O
paused O
for O
even O
a O
moment O
to O
catch O
our O
breath O
. O

At O
6 O
pm O
, O
we O
marched O
back O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
so O
deathly O
tired O
that O
one O
always O
tried O
to O
support O
the O
others O
. O

To O
that O
end O
, O
we O
had O
to O
sing O
marching O
songs B-TER
and O
march O
at O
a O
walking O
pace O
. O

If O
someone O
lagged O
behind O
a O
bit O
, O
the O
dog O
was O
set O
loose O
on O
them O
. O

At O
the O
camp B-TER
gates O
stood O
two O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
and O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
who O
counted O
us O
and O
occasionally O
one O
of O
us O
would O
be O
removed O
from O
the O
ranks O
and O
searched O
. O

We O
beside O
the O
unlucky O
ones O
who O
tried O
to O
smuggle B-TER
a O
turnip B-TER
or O
a O
tomato B-TER
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

They O
would O
be O
battered B-TER
so O
badly O
until O
they O
were O
lying O
unconscious O
on O
the O
road O
: O
if O
they O
were O
lucky O
and O
could O
get O
themselves O
up O
out O
of O
the O
dust O
inconspicuously O
, O
the O
whole O
affair O
was O
over O
. O

If O
they O
stayed O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
they O
would O
be O
transported O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
and O
gassed B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
fogged O
day O
and O
night O
in O
a O
fatty O
, O
black O
smoke O
that O
came O
from O
the O
three O
chimneys O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

The O
stench O
, O
which O
I O
became O
used O
to O
after O
several O
months O
, O
was O
so O
unbearable O
that O
I O
continually O
vomited B-TER
. O

It O
was O
the O
revolting O
, O
sweet O
stench O
of O
burnt B-TER
flesh I-TER
and I-TER
hair I-TER
. O

Those O
primarily O
responsible O
for O
the O
gassings B-TER
were O
: O
Dr. O
Mengele B-PER
, O
a O
young O
man B-TER
whose O
pet O
fad O
it O
was O
to O
conduct O
experiments B-TER
on O
twins O
for O
his O
thesis O
on O
this O
subject O
; O
Dr. B-PER
Klein I-PER
, O
who O
was O
sentenced O
to O
death B-TER
at O
trial B-TER
in O
Lüneburg B-LOC
; O
the O
camp B-TER
commander I-TER
Cramer B-PER
, O
also O
executed B-TER
; O
and O
the O
SS B-TER
women B-TER
Mandel B-PER
and O
Drechsel B-PER
. O

Mandel B-PER
and O
Drechsel B-PER
were O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
am O
aware O
, O
never O
found O
, O
and O
are O
probably O
still O
at O
large O
. O

The O
occupants O
of O
my O
barrack B-TER
consisted O
of O
Italian B-LOC
, O
French B-LOC
, O
Greek B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
women B-TER
. O

The O
hardiest O
prisoners B-TER
were O
the O
Poles B-LOC
and O
Russians B-LOC
, O
whereas O
the O
Greeks B-LOC
and O
Italians B-LOC
died B-TER
like O
flies O
. O

If O
they O
did O
n’t O
die O
a O
natural O
death B-TER
from O
typhus B-TER
or O
dysentery B-TER
, O
they O
were O
inevitably O
chosen O
at O
the O
selections B-TER
. O

They O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
icy O
winter O
weather O
and O
suffered O
terribly O
from O
the O
symptoms O
of O
frostbite B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
1943 O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
Jews O
were O
practically O
non O
- O
existent O
: O
the O
work B-TER
was O
just O
too O
difficult O
for O
them O
and O
they O
were O
often O
taken O
straight O
from O
their O
place O
of O
work B-TER
, O
where O
they O
collapsed O
unconscious O
, O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

The O
internal B-TER
administration I-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
namely O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
the O
clothing B-TER
store O
, O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
kitchen B-TER
, O
delousing B-TER
etc O
. O

was O
put O
solely O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
prisoners B-TER
, O
who O
were O
selected O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
for O
this O
work B-TER
. O

Some O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
misused O
their O
preferential O
treatment O
, O
above O
all O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Kapos B-TER
, O
who O
were O
responsible O
for O
the O
labour B-TER
units I-TER
. O

They O
were O
often O
German B-LOC
, O
non O
- O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
, O
who O
were O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
for O
one O
of O
the O
following O
reasons O
: O
refusal O
to O
work B-TER
, O
prostitution O
or O
repeat O
offenders O
. O

We O
often O
suffered O
more O
under O
these O
prisoners B-TER
than O
under O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
who O
at O
least O
concerned O
themselves O
with O
the O
internal O
affairs O
a O
little O
, O
whereas O
we O
relied O
on O
these O
prisoners B-TER
for O
matters O
of O
life O
and O
death B-TER
. O

They O
have O
the O
lives O
of O
lots O
of O
Jews O
, O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
on O
their O
conscience O
, O
as O
they O
wanted O
to O
distinguish O
themselves O
in O
front O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
by O
violence O
towards O
us O
. O

The O
mortality B-TER
rates O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
rose O
every O
winter O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
year O
- O
round O
typhus B-TER
epidemic B-TER
claimed O
a O
lot O
of O
victims B-TER
, O
as O
did O
dysentery B-TER
and O
finally O
exhaustion O
. O

Many O
committed O
suicide B-TER
by O
throwing O
themselves O
at O
the O
high O
- O
voltage O
barbed O
wire O
, O
on O
which O
they O
would O
hang O
for O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
until O
their O
bodies B-TER
were O
removed O
from O
the O
wire O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Every O
morning O
before O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
those O
who O
had O
died B-TER
overnight O
were O
laid O
out O
before O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
after O
they O
had O
been O
completely O
undressed B-TER
, O
then O
the O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
who O
were O
given O
their O
rapport O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
reported O
: O
two O
thousand O
standing O
, O
fifty O
dead B-TER
, O
two O
hundred O
sick B-TER
. O

The O
200 O
sick B-TER
prisoners B-TER
were O
then O
sent O
off O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Revier O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
the O
next O
step O
being O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

Before O
my O
arrival O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
before O
and O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
how O
, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
I O
stared O
disbelievingly O
at O
a O
pile O
of O
twisted O
limbs O
piled O
on O
top O
of O
each O
other O
, O
until O
it O
became O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
these O
were O
dead B-TER
women B-TER
. O

I O
soon O
got O
used O
to O
this O
sight O
, O
however O
and O
later O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
Leichenkommando B-TER
for O
a O
while O
, O
in O
which O
it O
was O
my O
responsibility O
to O
load O
the O
naked O
bodies B-TER
onto O
a O
cart O
, O
which O
would O
then O
be O
driven O
into O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
that O
, O
for O
the O
individual O
people B-TER
, O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
being O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
the O
continual O
physical O
humiliation B-TER
and O
the O
sense O
of O
complete O
hopelessness O
in O
facing O
their O
future O
. O

Many O
of O
us O
had O
no O
fear B-TER
left O
of O
being O
gassed B-TER
and O
hoped O
to O
die B-TER
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
still O
believed O
in O
God B-TER
prayed B-TER
every O
evening O
: O
Dear O
God O
, O
let O
us O
not O
wake O
up O
tomorrow O
. O

No O
, O
the O
worst O
was O
to O
stand O
still O
, O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
, O
morning O
and O
evening O
in O
the O
piercing O
cold O
, O
and O
in O
summer O
in O
sweltering O
heat O
, O
until O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
accounted O
for O
. O

Almost O
all O
of O
us O
suffered O
from O
chronic O
, O
bleeding B-TER
dysentery I-TER
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
go O
to O
the O
latrines B-TER
during O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

The O
consequences O
of O
this O
ban O
were O
unavoidable O
and O
it O
was O
this O
degrading O
humiliation B-TER
that O
was O
a O
greater O
agony O
for O
many O
of O
us O
than O
the O
constantly O
smoking O
chimneys O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
in O
front O
of O
us O
. O

It O
was O
the O
realisation O
that O
we O
had O
all O
lost O
every O
sign O
of O
civilisation O
in O
a O
frighteningly O
short O
space O
of O
time O
. O

We O
did O
not O
wash B-TER
any O
more O
, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
water B-TER
, O
it O
was O
so O
icy O
cold O
and O
we O
were O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
, O
we O
stank B-TER
, O
our O
whole O
bodies O
were O
festering B-TER
, O
we O
threw O
ourselves O
like O
wild O
animals O
at O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
we O
drank B-TER
the O
water B-TER
from O
dirty O
puddles O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
first O
Hungarian B-LOC
transport B-TER
of O
Jews O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

They O
arrived O
in O
such O
numbers O
that O
the O
crematorium B-TER
could O
no O
longer O
cope O
with O
the O
workload O
. O

We O
had O
to O
shovel O
enormous O
pits O
near O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

Those O
who O
had O
been O
gassed B-TER
were O
covered O
in O
petrol O
there O
and O
burnt B-TER
out I-TER
in O
the O
open O
. O

Small O
children B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
flames O
alive O
. O

We O
could O
hear O
their O
screams O
right O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
on O
command O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
the O
entire O
gypsy B-TER
camp B-TER
, O
which O
was O
next O
to O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
was O
exterminated B-TER
. O

Nobody O
survived B-TER
. O

They O
were O
all O
gassed B-TER
, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
perfectly O
healthy B-TER
young O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
in O
this O
camp B-TER
. O

Shortly O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
last O
Hungarian B-LOC
transport B-TER
, O
the O
evacuation B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
began O
, O
as O
the O
Russian B-LOC
front B-TER
was O
advancing O
at O
an O
alarming O
rate O
. O

The O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
were O
blown O
up O
, O
so O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
would O
not O
find O
them O
. O

On O
10th O
October O
1944 O
, O
I O
left O
the O
camp B-TER
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
with O
my O
sister O
and O
arrived O
a O
week O
later O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
of O
Belsen B-LOC
, O
after O
an O
eventful O
journey O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
wagon I-TER
. O

On O
15th O
April O
1945 O
we O
were O
released B-TER
by O
the O
English B-LOC
. O
