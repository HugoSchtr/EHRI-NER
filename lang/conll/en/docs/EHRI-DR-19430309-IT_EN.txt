What O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
press B-TER
of O
neutral B-TER
countries I-TER
, O
namely O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
said O
to O
be O
negotiating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
Germany B-TER
and O
with O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
concerning O
the O
removal O
from O
Bulgaria B-LOC
of O
significant O
groups O
of O
press B-TER
of O
Israelites B-TER
, I-TER
is O
true O
. O

Germany B-TER
has O
offered O
to O
transfer O
the O
Bulgarian O
Jewish B-TER
groups I-TER
to O
the O
ghettoes B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
has O
asked O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
pay O
the O
sum O
of O
five O
- O
hundred O
marks O
per O
person O
for O
transport O
costs O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
property O
seized O
locally O
. O

Bulgarians B-TER
have O
resisted O
this O
request O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
nothing O
has O
been O
decided O
as O
yet O
on O
the O
financial O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
departures O
of O
Jews B-TER
for O
Poland B-LOC
have O
already O
begun O
, O
albeit O
limited O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
groups I-TER
living O
in O
the O
new O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territories O
, O
Thrace B-LOC
and O
Macedonia B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
are O
Jewish B-TER
communities I-TER
that O
have O
been O
estimated O
at O
approx O
. O

twenty O
- O
thousand O
individuals O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
ancient O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territory O
nothing O
definite O
has O
been O
decided O
, O
because O
reportedly O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
opposing O
a O
marked O
resistance B-TER
. O

With O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
there O
have O
been O
negotiations O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Government I-ORG
about O
dispatching O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
four O
- O
thousand O
adult O
Bulgarian B-TER
Jews B-TER
and O
four O
- O
thousand O
Jewish B-TER
children O
. O

But O
the O
Reich B-TER
has O
stepped O
in O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
has O
“ O
vetoed O
” O
this O
departure O
, O
judging O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
that O
it O
is O
dangerous O
to O
transfer O
to O
an O
enemy O
territory O
such O
decidedly O
anti O
- O
German O
elements O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
apparently O
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
has O
resumed O
these O
negotiations O
despite O
that O
“ O
veto O
” O
, O
limiting O
them O
to O
the O
four O
- O
thousand O
children O
who O
would O
be O
accompanied O
by O
no O
more O
than O
five O
- O
hundred O
adults O
. O

This O
negotiation O
as O
well O
, O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
encounter O
problems O
of O
a O
financial O
nature O
. O
