About O
my O
town O
, O
Khmelnik B-LOC
[ O
Chmielnik B-LOC
] O
near O
Kielce B-LOC
I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
day O
. O

It O
was O
before O
Passover B-TER
in O
the O
year O
1943 O
, O
in O
the O
month O
of O
March O
, O
around O
five O
months O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
aktion B-TER
from O
our O
city O
. O

After O
the O
deportation B-TER
, O
there O
were O
almost O
forty O
of O
us O
left O
, O
and O
later O
there O
were O
only O
thirteen O
people B-TER
left O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
gendarmerie O
, O
hacking O
wood O
, O
sweeping O
, O
bringing O
water O
, O
scrubbing O
floors O
and O
cleanings O
things O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
it O
was O
my O
job O
to O
work B-TER
the O
garden O
, O
and O
on O
this O
basis O
we O
still O
remained O
. O

No O
Jew O
was O
allowed B-TER
to O
be O
in O
the O
town O
any O
longer O
, O
following O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
all O
our O
martyrs B-TER
, O
and O
of O
those O
remaining O
, O
from O
the O
forty O
people B-TER
, O
[ O
most O
] O
went O
to O
Kielce B-LOC
to O
the O
HASAG O
ammunition O
factory B-TER
, O
but O
we O
thirteen O
people B-TER
remained O
here O
for O
a O
while O
longer O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
. O

I O
was O
among O
those O
left O
behind O
, O
among O
the O
above O
mentioned O
workers B-TER
. O

Then O
the O
factory B-TER
from O
Kielce B-LOC
sent O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
workers B-TER
from O
the O
work B-TER
column O
to O
us O
in O
the O
town O
and O
other O
similar O
ones O
in O
the O
area O
for O
the O
potato B-TER
contingent O
for O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
because O
the O
factory B-TER
also O
produced O
potato B-TER
flakes I-TER
. O

Therefore O
Jewish O
worker B-TER
columns O
had O
to O
work B-TER
in O
difficult B-TER
conditions I-TER
, O
because O
before O
Pesach B-TER
, O
in O
the O
month O
of O
March O
, O
when O
one O
uncovers O
the O
trenches O
containing O
the O
potatoes B-TER
, O
there O
are O
winds B-TER
[ O
and O
] O
wet O
snow B-TER
which O
pierce O
the O
heart O
. O

But O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
Jews O
at O
that O
time O
was O
painted O
dark O
black O
and O
clouded O
over O
for O
the O
Jewish O
people B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
one O
beautiful O
day O
, O
the O
truck O
arrived O
to O
take O
potatoes B-TER
. O

It O
drove O
up O
to O
the O
one O
single O
house O
which O
was O
left O
of O
the O
Jewish O
ghetto B-TER
: O
for O
the O
thirteen O
people B-TER
remaining O
from O
the O
ten O
thousand O
Jews O
. O

You O
know O
it O
was O
my O
luck O
that O
then O
I O
had O
time O
to O
observe O
, O
because O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
garden O
: O
and O
why O
specifically O
did O
it O
drive O
up O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
thirteen O
people B-TER
? O
Because O
they O
had O
to O
pay B-TER
( O
pa O
blatu O
) O
protection O
money O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
security O
chief O
, O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
thirteen O
people B-TER
were O
still O
not O
under O
barbed O
wire O
. O

And O
besides O
that O
, O
because O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
bring O
people B-TER
into O
the O
factory B-TER
from O
the O
city O
, O
some O
of O
them O
children B-TER
or O
wives B-TER
or O
brothers B-TER
or O
just O
family B-TER
[ O
of O
workers B-TER
] O
and O
so O
on O
. O

But O
I O
did O
not O
know O
the O
demons O
very O
well O
, O
and O
moreover O
my O
own O
child B-TER
then O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Therefore O
, O
when O
the O
freight O
wagons O
would O
come O
to O
the O
house O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
would O
immediately O
approach O
the O
wagon O
, O
because O
my O
nature O
was O
such O
and O
because O
we O
received O
signs O
from O
the O
people B-TER
, O
perhaps O
a O
few O
were O
coming O
. O

But O
maybe O
our O
brothers B-TER
and O
children B-TER
from O
the O
factory B-TER
wanted O
something O
and O
then O
they O
would O
secretly O
throw O
inside O
a O
bit O
of O
paper O
and O
write B-TER
something I-TER
that O
we O
should O
know O
what O
is O
going O
on O
with O
them O
. O

And O
we O
understood O
this O
and O
from O
this O
deduced O
what O
they O
want O
. O

Because O
writing O
was O
not O
allowed O
for O
the O
Jewish O
criminals O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
offenders O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
duty O
, O
to O
stay O
in O
touch O
with O
them O
so O
that O
no O
one O
should O
guess O
for O
what O
purpose O
I O
needed O
to O
approach O
the O
wagon O
. O

Yet O
I O
was O
very O
surprised O
when O
, O
upon O
going O
to O
the O
wagon O
, O
I O
saw O
inside O
three O
little O
heads O
of O
helpless O
young O
boys B-TER
[ O
aged O
] O
around O
twelve O
or O
thirteen O
years O
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
called O
Shufke O
from O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
the O
other O
Solarz O
from O
Jędrzejów B-LOC
( O
Yendrev B-LOC
) O
, O
the O
third O
from O
Staszów B-LOC
( O
Stashev B-LOC
) O
, O
his O
name O
I O
can O
sadly O
no O
longer O
remember O
. O

And O
by O
them O
was O
standing O
a O
guard O
, O
an O
SS B-ORG
officer I-ORG
, O
he O
was O
called O
Vitok O
, O
the O
greatest O
enemy O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

My O
eyes O
should O
never O
see O
again O
such O
things O
as O
took O
place O
then O
. O

He O
was O
from O
the O
Leipzig B-LOC
HASAG B-LOC
factory B-TER
and O
had O
been O
dispatched O
to O
the O
Kielce B-LOC
HASAG B-LOC
factory B-TER
, O
he O
was O
leader O
of O
the O
work B-TER
commando O
. O

Then O
I O
go O
to O
him O
, O
because O
I O
had O
something O
to O
give O
him O
as O
a O
bribe B-TER
, O
and O
asked O
him O
to O
where O
the O
wagons O
were O
going O
today O
. O

He O
answers O
me O
that O
they O
are O
going O
to O
Nowy B-LOC
Korczyn I-LOC
, O
that O
is O
Naystadt B-LOC
in O
Yiddish O
, O
near O
Wiślica B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
the O
poor O
sheep O
saw O
me O
talking O
with O
him O
. O

Then O
they O
called O
me O
, O
with O
the O
words O
, O
Dear O
man O
, O
dear O
brother O
, O
and O
their O
eyes O
shone O
like O
the O
bright O
moon O
or O
the O
shining O
sun O
on O
a O
clear O
, O
beautiful O
day O
. O

And O
this O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
: O
[ O
they O
were O
] O
very O
clever O
and O
they O
understood O
something O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
pounded O
inside O
me O
. O

What O
is O
happening O
to O
them O
? O
Because O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
we O
always O
had O
the O
foreboding O
of O
[ O
… O
] O
, O
Word O
unclear O
. O

Being O
shot O
? O
Being O
killed O
? O
today O
them O
but O
tomorrow O
us O
, O
so O
people B-TER
who O
were O
more O
or O
less O
honest O
constantly O
thought O
. O

Then O
, O
when O
the O
brute O
went O
into O
our O
house O
, O
leaving O
a O
guard B-ORG
outside O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
children B-TER
with O
bread B-TER
, O
to O
give O
them O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

I O
give O
them O
the O
food B-TER
and O
the O
children B-TER
will O
not O
take O
it O
. O

However O
, O
they O
fall O
upon O
me O
and O
begin O
to O
kiss O
me O
, O
Dear O
Jew O
, O
beloved O
uncle O
, O
save O
us O
from O
danger O
. O

I O
ask O
them O
, O
with O
a O
choking O
heart O
throat O
? O
, O
What O
is O
happening O
to O
you O
dear O
children O
? O
They O
tell O
me O
that O
were O
selected O
from O
the O
factory B-TER
as O
the O
youngest O
and O
smallest O
, O
not O
capable O
of O
work B-TER
. O

They O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
dragging O
small O
carts O
with O
iron O
from O
one O
hall O
to O
the O
other O
. O

And O
today O
, O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
they O
were O
woken O
up O
to O
leave O
, O
they O
do O
not O
know O
where O
they O
are O
going O
. O

But O
they O
heard O
that O
they O
are O
sending O
them O
to O
Naystadt B-LOC
to O
pack O
hay O
, O
because O
there O
are O
also O
a O
few O
Jews O
working B-TER
in O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
there O
, O
and O
they O
will O
work B-TER
there O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
it O
. O

So O
strong O
were O
the O
minds O
of O
these O
poor O
children B-TER
. O

I O
remember O
how O
one O
begged O
me O
that O
I O
should O
give O
him O
a O
pencil O
: O
he O
wants O
to O
write B-TER
something I-TER
for O
his O
brother B-TER
who O
still O
remained O
working B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
in O
Kielce B-LOC
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
red O
from O
crying O
. O

Quiet O
and O
[ O
searching O
? O
] O
and O
clever O
, O
so O
that O
his O
cleverness O
shone O
forth O
from O
his O
forehead O
, O
and O
he O
was O
called O
Shufke O
. O

So O
I O
give O
him O
my O
pencil O
, O
and O
he O
writes O
his O
farewell B-TER
letter I-TER
to O
his O
brother B-TER
in O
the O
wagon O
, O
off O
to O
the O
side O
, O
so O
that O
no O
one O
should O
notice O
what O
he O
is O
doing O
. O

And O
the O
other O
turns O
to O
me O
to O
consult O
with O
me O
, O
he O
wants O
to O
flee B-TER
, O
with O
such O
clever O
words O
he O
speaks O
to O
me O
that O
it O
reached O
the O
depths O
of O
my O
heart O
. O

But O
how O
can O
one O
stand O
hearing O
such O
clever O
children B-TER
? O
In O
truth O
, O
one O
would O
need O
to O
be O
made O
from O
steel O
to O
bear O
this O
, O
and O
to O
see O
the O
pitiful O
state O
of O
the O
poor O
, O
powerless O
sheep O
. O

And O
I O
, O
as O
an O
old O
man B-TER
, O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
is O
bursting O
inside O
me O
, O
and O
I O
raise O
my O
eyes O
to O
heaven O
and O
ask O
, O
Lord O
of O
the O
World O
, O
where O
are O
You O
and O
where O
am O
I O
? O
Why O
have O
you O
hidden O
Your O
mercy O
from O
such O
holy O
sheep O
? O
and O
I O
continue O
, O
If O
only O
I O
had O
gone O
with O
them O
, O
where O
my O
wife O
and O
children O
and O
where O
all O
my O
brothers O
and O
friends O
and O
all O
the O
Jews O
went O
, O
I O
would O
not O
see O
the O
crying O
and O
begging O
of O
the O
powerless O
children O
here O
. O

What O
do O
You O
want O
from O
me O
beloved O
God O
? O
In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
to O
see O
how O
they O
take O
the O
dearest O
of O
the O
people O
, O
completely O
innocent O
, O
for O
an O
offering O
. O

However O
, O
I O
calm O
myself O
and O
strengthen O
myself O
and O
ask O
them O
once O
again O
: O
Dear O
children O
, O
and O
kiss O
them O
one O
by O
one O
, O
What O
do O
you O
know O
that O
you O
are O
so O
scared O
? O
They O
tell O
me O
, O
like O
seventy O
- O
year O
- O
old O
men B-TER
, O
Why O
ask O
? O
Our O
hearts O
tell O
us O
that O
today O
is O
our O
last O
day O
in O
the O
beautiful O
, O
bright O
world O
. O

And O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
enjoyed O
the O
world O
and O
have O
done O
no O
wrong O
. O

And O
we O
must O
leave O
it O
so O
young O
, O
and O
our O
bones O
will O
decay O
in O
God O
’s O
earth O
so O
early O
. O

Cursed O
shall O
be O
the O
earth O
which O
will O
take O
our O
innocent O
blood O
. O

And O
my O
heart O
tears O
into O
pieces O
inside O
me O
, O
and O
I O
choke O
and O
can O
not O
speak O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
I O
wink O
to O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
he O
is O
still O
here O
today O
in O
the O
German B-TER
land I-TER
, O
his O
name O
is O
Fleishheker B-PER
, O
to O
give O
the O
murderer B-TER
schnapps B-TER
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

And O
I O
will O
talk O
a O
while O
longer O
with O
the O
pure O
little O
souls O
, O
And O
I O
go O
to O
them O
and O
ask O
, O
Why O
are O
you O
so O
afraid O
children O
? O
They O
answer O
me O
, O
We O
are O
not O
afraid O
of O
death O
. O

However O
, O
they O
continue O
, O
But O
tell O
us O
, O
will O
anyone O
remain O
and O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
the O
world O
the O
truth O
, O
that O
we O
were O
innocent O
, O
and O
where O
our O
bones O
will O
come O
to O
rest O
? O
Because O
they O
know O
already O
, O
that O
today O
them O
and O
tomorrow O
somebody O
else O
… O
. O

Dear O
God O
, O
who O
of O
us O
will O
remain O
? O
Who O
will O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
others O
about O
it O
and O
take O
revenge O
? O
One O
of O
them O
wants O
to O
run B-TER
from O
the O
wagon O
, O
but O
a O
guard O
stands O
there O
. O

I O
say O
to O
him O
, O
You O
see O
how O
they O
guard O
us O
. O

If O
you O
leave O
the O
vehicle O
, O
then O
he O
will O
shoot O
you O
. O

He O
says O
, O
I O
want O
that O
to O
happen O
, O
because O
perhaps O
then O
someone O
will O
remain O
who O
will O
know O
that O
my O
grave O
is O
here O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Chmelnik O
. O

I O
say O
to O
them O
, O
Wait O
, O
maybe O
I O
will O
be O
able O
to O
ask O
to O
go O
with O
you O
to O
Korczyn O
, O
and O
there O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
until O
I O
see O
what O
happens O
with O
you O
. O

This O
will O
be O
the O
sign O
: O
if O
we O
travel O
to O
Korczyn O
, O
then O
you O
are O
destined O
to O
live O
and O
stay O
there O
to O
work O
. O

And O
I O
calm O
the O
children B-TER
. O

And O
the O
other O
one O
gives O
me O
the O
letter B-TER
for O
his O
brother B-TER
in O
Kielce B-LOC
, O
that O
I O
should O
hide O
it O
until O
there O
is O
an O
opportunity O
for O
me O
to O
send O
it O
back O
with O
a O
wagon O
. O

And O
the O
workers B-TER
knew O
that O
they O
should O
search O
in O
the O
wagons O
, O
perhaps O
they O
will O
find O
something O
which O
brings O
news O
from O
outside O
the O
camp O
, O
Exodus O
13 O
: O
46 O
because O
they O
would O
also O
do O
so O
when O
they O
packed O
and O
sent O
away O
letters B-TER
to O
other O
Jews O
with O
the O
train O
line O
. O

Maybe O
someone O
will O
know O
about O
this O
. O

I O
take O
the O
letter B-TER
and O
go O
into O
the O
house O
to O
the O
great O
murderer B-TER
Vitok O
and O
begin O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
the O
children B-TER
. O

He O
explains O
to O
me O
openly O
that O
they O
are O
taking O
them O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Naystadt B-LOC
. O

But O
I O
must O
believe O
him O
. O

Then O
I O
ask O
him O
the O
question O
: O
for B-TER
another I-TER
liter I-TER
of O
schnapps B-TER
, O
maybe O
I O
can O
go O
with O
them O
? O
He O
answers O
me O
yes O
, O
but O
on O
one O
condition O
. O

I O
need O
permission O
from O
my O
gendarmerie B-TER
. O

So O
I O
go O
to O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
post O
, O
to O
the O
lieutenant O
. O

He O
was O
called O
Haas B-PER
Hans I-PER
from O
Cologne B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
plead O
with O
him O
, O
telling O
him O
that O
I O
have O
buried O
some O
gold B-TER
at O
my O
uncle B-TER
’s O
home O
and O
will O
maybe O
find O
it O
and O
then O
I O
will O
give O
him O
the O
golden O
calf O
. O

He O
gives O
me O
a O
note O
to O
travel O
with O
the O
murderer B-TER
. O

And O
we O
mount O
the O
wagon O
and O
depart O
. O

Arriving O
in O
Busk B-LOC
( O
Busko B-LOC
- I-LOC
Zdrój I-LOC
) O
, O
a O
town O
which O
lies O
in O
the O
middle O
between O
Chmelnik B-LOC
and O
Korczyn B-LOC
, O
he O
gets O
down O
and O
sobers O
up O
a O
bit O
and O
the O
guards O
watch O
the O
children B-TER
like O
a O
valuable O
jewel O
. O

In O
Busko B-LOC
- I-LOC
Zdrój I-LOC
he O
demands O
more O
schnapps B-TER
. O

Why O
? O
Because O
he O
is O
an O
honorable O
man O
, O
he O
is O
taking O
them O
to O
Korczyn B-LOC
. O

But O
there O
’s O
nothing O
to O
be O
done O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
meaning O
Maybe O
the O
schnapps B-TER
will O
redeem B-TER
the O
pure O
souls O
. O

I O
go O
with O
him O
to O
the O
tavern O
. O

No O
trace O
of O
a O
Jew O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
little O
district O
village O
. O

Only O
we O
four O
mice O
. O

And O
they O
look O
at O
us O
like O
we O
come O
from O
the O
other O
world O
. O

For O
five O
months O
they O
have O
seen O
no O
Jews O
and O
today O
, O
once O
again O
, O
these O
four O
mice O
. O

We O
truly O
quaked O
in O
fear O
, O
not O
because O
of O
the O
demons O
( O
Nazis O
) O
but O
rather O
because O
of O
the O
Poles B-TER
, O
they O
grumble O
Zhids O
, O
Zhids O
… O
However O
, O
I O
order O
them O
to O
pour O
schnapps B-TER
and O
have O
a O
conversation O
with O
him O
. O

Dear O
Mr. O
Vitok O
explains O
to O
me O
about O
the O
three O
children B-TER
and O
why O
they O
took O
them O
out O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
I O
have O
a O
long O
talk O
with O
him O
. O

However O
, O
the O
evil O
one O
is O
so O
thoroughly O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
from O
drink O
that O
he O
always O
answered O
me O
the O
same O
. O

They O
are O
being O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Korczyn B-LOC
, O
to O
pack O
hay O
, O
because O
the O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
is O
very O
hard O
for O
them O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
these O
are O
young O
children B-TER
, O
and O
the O
factory B-TER
is O
not O
allowed O
to O
keep O
such O
children B-TER
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
factory B-TER
security O
director O
, O
Berger O
, O
sent O
them O
to O
do O
lighter O
work B-TER
. O

He O
calmed O
me O
because O
his O
tone O
accorded O
with O
his O
words O
. O

And O
then O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
children B-TER
and O
told O
them O
everything O
. O

However O
, O
hey O
would O
not O
be O
comforted O
, O
In O
Hebrew O
. O

However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
follow O
an O
exact O
Biblical O
verse O
. O

because O
they O
said O
that O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
any O
German B-TER
. O

And O
they O
thanked O
me O
for O
my O
trouble O
and O
hoped O
that O
God O
would O
repay O
me O
. O

And O
again O
, O
back O
to O
my O
beloved O
children B-TER
, O
and O
they O
say O
again O
, O
Today O
us O
and O
tomorrow O
who O
knows O
which O
of O
the O
remaining O
few O
Jews O
? O
And O
who O
will O
comfort O
them O
and O
be O
able O
to O
comfort O
them O
? O
The O
writer O
of O
these O
lines O
can O
and O
will O
never O
forget O
this O
day O
. O

The O
words O
of O
the O
beloved O
young O
children B-TER
from O
a O
famous O
people B-TER
. O

We O
travel O
on O
to O
Korczyn B-LOC
and O
arrive O
in O
the O
city O
at O
11 O
AM O
. O

We O
approach O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
in O
Korczyn B-LOC
. O

We O
stop O
, O
and O
a O
few O
Jews O
who O
worked B-TER
there O
hacking O
wood O
and O
building O
walls O
for O
a O
house O
come O
outside O
and O
look O
at O
me O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
they O
see O
the O
three O
children B-TER
. O

I O
tell O
them O
the O
whole O
story O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
that O
it O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
hay O
here O
to O
pack O
for O
horses O
, O
because O
this O
place O
is O
by O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
and O
there O
is O
empty O
pasture O
land O
. O

However O
, O
they O
explain O
to O
me O
that O
it O
[ O
the O
work B-TER
] O
is O
not O
for O
children B-TER
, O
because O
it O
requires O
great O
strength O
. O

Then O
I O
continue O
standing O
there O
as O
though O
paralyzed O
, O
and O
I O
think O
to O
myself O
, O
the O
children B-TER
were O
indeed O
right O
. O

Yet O
nevertheless O
, O
perhaps O
something O
can O
be O
done O
for O
the O
children B-TER
. O

I O
approach O
these O
Jews O
, O
maybe O
they O
will O
know O
something O
. O

However O
, O
they O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
here O
are O
not O
so O
bad O
. O

I O
think O
maybe O
they O
will O
indeed O
do O
some O
work B-TER
with O
the O
hay O
: O
[ O
maybe O
] O
they O
intend O
for O
them O
to O
do O
the O
work B-TER
, O
thinking O
that O
the O
faster O
it O
will O
be O
finished O
, O
the O
sooner O
they O
can O
put O
an O
end O
to O
us O
. O

But O
I O
notice O
that O
no O
one O
approaches O
the O
three O
children B-TER
, O
rather O
they O
stand O
outside O
like O
dogs O
under O
guard O
. O

They O
have O
bread B-TER
but O
will O
not O
eat O
it O
. O

I O
go O
to O
them O
again O
and O
say O
, O
Eat O
something O
my O
children O
. O

They O
respond O
, O
We O
need O
no O
food O
already O
, O
we O
will O
never O
again O
demand O
any O
food O
or O
any O
work O
. O

It O
rips O
my O
heart O
and O
my O
thoughts O
afflict O
me O
: O
how O
are O
the O
children B-TER
so O
convinced O
of O
their O
truth O
? O
And O
they O
say O
to O
me O
again O
, O
We O
are O
not O
going O
to O
work O
here O
. O

Rather O
they O
are O
going O
to O
mow O
down O
our O
young O
lives O
. O

And O
the O
watchman B-TER
hears O
how O
the O
three O
swallows O
talk O
to O
me O
and O
turns O
away O
his O
face O
pretending O
not O
to O
see O
and O
hear O
how O
the O
pure O
young O
souls O
speak O
to O
me O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
he O
turns O
back O
to O
me O
and O
says O
, O
Go O
away O
! O
They O
do O
not O
need O
any O
food O
, O
with O
such O
sarcasm O
. O

Then O
I O
go O
off O
to O
the O
side O
so O
that O
no O
one O
will O
notice O
me O
and O
cry O
my O
heart O
out O
and O
say O
, O
Servants O
rule O
over O
us O
, O
Lamentations O
5:8 O
. O

and O
see O
how O
the O
black O
clouds O
are O
gathering O
above O
us O
. O

And O
I O
ask O
myself O
further O
, O
how O
does O
our O
wisdom O
help O
us O
, O
even O
that O
of O
three O
such O
young O
children B-TER
, O
when O
their O
foolish O
mind O
is O
prized O
now O
? O
The O
clock O
strikes O
. O

It O
is O
4 O
PM O
and O
we O
must O
begin O
the O
return O
journey O
. O

And O
they O
remain O
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
not O
move O
and O
am O
crazy O
, O
losing O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
my O
boss O
comes O
out O
and O
says O
to O
me O
that O
we O
must O
leave O
soon O
. O

We O
must O
stay O
a O
little O
and O
Vitok O
goes O
back O
inside O
and O
comes O
out O
from O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
white O
as O
chalk O
. O

Then O
I O
ask O
him O
, O
Mr. O
Vitok O
, O
why O
they O
are O
not O
taking O
the O
children O
to O
work O
as O
you O
told O
me O
? O
He O
takes O
the O
children B-TER
and O
leads O
them O
inside O
to O
the O
horse O
stables O
and O
says O
that O
they O
will O
directly O
be O
given O
light O
work B-TER
. O

And O
he O
calls O
me O
aside O
and O
orders O
me O
to O
prepare O
to O
return O
, O
but O
[ O
first O
] O
he O
wants O
another B-TER
schnapps B-TER
, O
what O
will O
one O
not O
do O
to O
save O
a O
life O
, O
what O
’s O
another O
schnapps B-TER
? O
I O
go O
off O
with O
him O
, O
and O
this O
was O
a O
pretense O
so O
that O
I O
should O
not O
see O
how O
they O
take O
them O
out O
to O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
. O

Returning O
with O
him O
, O
on O
the O
way O
I O
hear O
a O
few O
shots B-TER
, O
because O
the O
water O
of O
the O
Vistula B-LOC
is O
close O
to O
the O
city O
. O

We O
return O
to O
vehicle O
in O
which O
we O
must O
travel O
, O
which O
is O
standing O
in O
the O
gendarmerie B-TER
yard O
, O
and O
a O
wagon O
arrives O
with O
three O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
who O
then O
go O
inside O
to O
the O
administrative O
office O
. O

I O
go O
to O
the O
Christian B-TER
wagon O
- O
driver O
and O
ask O
him O
what O
happened O
now O
, O
what O
were O
the O
few O
shots O
. O

He O
says O
to O
me O
, O
Do O
n’t O
you O
know O
? O
I O
took O
three O
little O
Zhids O
to O
the O
water O
and O
they O
were O
taken O
care O
of O
… O
Who O
are O
you O
? O
You O
’re O
not O
one O
of O
our O
Zhids O
. O

You O
’re O
a O
stranger O
, O
because O
you O
do O
n’t O
know O
our O
gendarme O
. O

He O
is O
called O
Gavenda O
, O
a O
Volksdeutsch O
, O
he O
is O
the O
best O
shooter O
. O

With O
this O
I O
ended O
my O
work B-TER
day O
. O

The O
wise O
children B-TER
, O
poor O
things O
, O
raised O
up O
their O
souls O
by O
the O
water O
, O
and O
no O
one O
knows O
, O
poor O
things O
, O
where O
their O
young O
bones O
, O
which O
left O
the O
world O
so O
early O
and O
in O
an O
untimely O
manner O
, O
are O
decaying O
in O
the O
earth O
. O

However O
, O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
day O
. O
