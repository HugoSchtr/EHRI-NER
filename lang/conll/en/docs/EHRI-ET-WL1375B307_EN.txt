My O
Dears O
By O
now O
you O
will O
have O
received O
the O
airmail O
letters B-TER
we O
sent O
from O
here O
, O
from O
which O
you O
will O
have O
gathered O
that O
we O
have O
now O
arrived O
safely O
. O

As O
mentioned O
in O
the O
letter B-TER
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
write O
to O
you O
from O
the O
ship B-TER
, O
but O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
on O
account O
of O
a O
rather O
stormy O
crossing O
. O

I O
will O
now O
finally O
do O
what O
I O
had O
intended O
and O
describe O
to O
you O
what O
happened O
to O
us O
following O
the O
crisis O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
. O

Of O
course O
I O
can O
only O
do O
this O
in O
the O
most O
general O
terms O
otherwise O
I O
would O
have O
to O
write O
a O
whole O
novel O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
moved O
to O
X. O
on O
10th O
October O
. O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
that O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Z. O
any O
longer O
under O
any O
circumstances O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the O
mobilisation O
was O
announced O
the O
rumour O
spread O
in O
Z. O
that O
if O
war O
broke O
out O
the O
Jews O
would O
all O
have O
their O
throats O
slit O
because O
they O
were O
responsible O
for O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

This O
was O
passed O
on O
to O
a O
number O
of O
acquaintances O
by O
trustworthy O
people O
, O
and O
some O
acquaintances O
had O
already O
left O
Z. O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

We O
did O
not O
do O
so O
, O
however O
, O
although O
we O
did O
listen O
to O
the O
radio B-TER
day O
and O
night O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

Initially O
I O
took O
the O
whole O
thing O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
gossip O
and O
assumed O
that O
everything O
had O
turned O
out O
for O
the O
best O
because O
war O
did O
not O
actually O
break O
out O
. O

However O
I O
decided O
from O
that O
point O
to O
live O
only O
in O
furnished O
accommodation B-TER
, O
because O
you O
are O
more O
mobile O
if O
something O
happens O
. O

So O
we O
put O
our O
furniture O
into O
storage O
with O
a O
removal O
company O
and O
rented O
two O
furnished O
rooms B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
X. O
chasing O
up O
the O
authorities B-TER
to O
make O
sure O
that O
our O
preparations O
for O
emigration B-TER
were O
progressing O
. O

However O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
now O
much O
more O
difficult O
and O
protracted O
than O
it O
used O
to O
be O
because O
you O
have O
to O
sort O
things O
out O
with O
many O
more O
offices B-TER
than O
before O
. O

We O
had O
reserved O
a O
place O
on O
a O
ship B-TER
for O
the O
28th O
December O
and O
wanted O
to O
travel O
together O
with O
A. O
However O
we O
changed O
this O
in O
the O
light O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

Before O
describing O
the O
events O
of O
10th O
November O
( O
exactly O
four O
weeks O
after O
our O
move O
to O
X. O
) O
I O
want O
to O
mention O
that O
there O
was O
a O
simple O
but O
particularly O
moving O
celebration O
of O
Chanukah O
on O
board O
the O
ship B-TER
. O

A O
gentleman O
who O
had O
already O
been O
living O
in O
Jerusalem B-LOC
for O
five O
years O
, O
and O
had O
apparently O
once O
been O
a O
newspaper B-TER
editor I-TER
, O
gave O
a O
speech O
, O
the O
motto O
of O
which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
adopt O
as O
the O
title O
for O
my O
descriptions O
, O
in O
particular O
because O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
... O
and O
you O
too O
, O
my O
dear O
... O
have O
written O
to O
say O
that O
we O
should O
forget O
what O
happened O
. O

Certainly O
one O
has O
to O
look O
to O
the O
future O
, O
but O
I O
would O
like O
to O
leave O
it O
up O
to O
your O
discretion O
to O
decide O
, O
once O
you O
have O
read O
what O
follows O
, O
whether O
it O
is O
perhaps O
right O
not O
to O
forget O
the O
things O
that O
have O
occurred O
, O
but O
instead O
make O
sure O
that O
our O
children B-TER
know O
about O
them O
one O
day O
too O
. O

The O
motto O
of O
the O
gentleman O
’s O
speech O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
Children O
of O
Israel O
, O
do O
not O
forget O
what O
Amalek O
did O
to O
you O
. O

Previously O
we O
had O
only O
known O
from O
school B-TER
what O
it O
was O
like O
to O
experience O
a O
pogrom B-TER
in O
which O
the O
Tempel B-TER
[ B-TER
synagogues B-TER
] O
are O
destroyed O
, O
now O
we O
know O
for O
ourselves O
. O

On O
the O
morning O
of O
10th O
November O
I O
drove O
into O
town O
to O
visit O
the O
removal O
company O
in O
order O
to O
sort O
out O
various O
things O
relating O
to O
the O
containers O
. O

I O
passed O
a O
Jewish O
jewellers O
and O
its O
blinds O
were O
down O
and O
there O
was O
broken B-TER
glass I-TER
on O
the O
street O
. O

I O
thought O
to O
myself O
that O
there O
must O
have O
been O
a O
burglary O
because O
we O
had O
not O
heard O
anything O
at O
home B-TER
about O
what O
had O
happened O
. O

En O
route O
to O
the O
removal O
company O
I O
then O
saw O
that O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
Jewish O
shops O
had O
been O
smashed B-TER
in O
and O
that O
some O
of O
the O
merchandise O
had O
been O
thrown B-TER
out I-TER
onto O
the O
street O
. O

In O
short O
, O
I O
encountered O
gangs O
of O
around O
15 O
to O
20 O
men B-TER
armed O
with O
axes O
and O
pickaxes O
who O
were O
in O
the O
process O
of O
smashing B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
removal O
company O
the O
glass O
rained O
down O
from O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
Klauß O
( O
orthodox O
synagogue B-TER
) O
right O
next O
door O
to O
the O
office O
. O

Inside O
much O
had O
already O
been O
destroyed B-TER
and O
lots O
of O
curious O
people O
were O
looking O
through O
the O
door O
, O
which O
had O
been O
smashed B-TER
with O
an O
axe O
. O

So O
these O
were O
the O
first O
things O
I O
experienced O
that O
morning O
on O
my O
journey O
into O
town O
. O

Initially O
everyone O
thought O
that O
the O
synagogues B-TER
and O
shops O
would O
be O
destroyed B-TER
and O
that O
that O
would O
then O
be O
the O
end O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
result O
I O
wanted O
to O
pay O
the O
removal O
company O
and O
buy O
our O
tickets O
for O
the O
ship B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
so O
that O
we O
could O
leave B-TER
suddenly O
if O
necessary O
. O

I O
telephoned O
... O
in O
Amsterdam B-LOC
because O
we O
had O
heard O
that O
it O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
get O
permission B-TER
to O
gain O
entry O
there O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
changed O
the O
booking O
to O
the O
Holland B-LOC
Line O
, O
because O
that O
would O
mean O
going O
to O
Rotterdam B-LOC
to O
board O
the O
ship B-TER
. O

If O
we O
used O
the O
American O
Line O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
the O
Dutch B-LOC
would O
tell O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
board O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

Jewish O
bank B-TER
accounts I-TER
were O
being O
kept O
under O
particularly O
strict O
surveillance O
by O
this O
point O
. O

Gaining O
access O
to O
our O
money O
in O
Z. O
was O
only O
possible O
after O
a O
number O
of O
telephone O
calls O
and O
after O
I O
had O
also O
got O
the O
removal O
company O
to O
make O
a O
call O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
payment O
for O
the O
container O
had O
to O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
Gestapo O
and O
the O
Kreisleitung O
[ O
Nazi O
municipal O
authorities O
] O
. O

At O
the O
banks B-TER
you O
also O
could O
not O
have O
unlimited O
access O
to O
your O
money O
and O
often O
had O
to O
collect O
a O
series O
of O
small O
amounts O
. O

A O
decree O
was O
also O
issued O
by O
the O
Bankenvereinigung O
[ O
banking O
association O
] O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
to O
the O
effect O
that O
to O
prevent O
a O
sharp O
fall O
in O
prices O
Jews O
could O
not O
sell O
their O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
. O

One O
could O
only O
sell O
stocks O
and O
bonds O
up O
to O
a O
maximum O
of O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
if O
the O
account B-TER
was O
not O
in O
credit O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
I O
spent O
the O
credit O
in O
my O
account B-TER
so O
that O
I O
could O
sell O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
worth O
of O
securities O
. O

One O
had O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
wade O
through O
all O
these O
things O
because O
it O
was O
often O
the O
case O
that O
by O
midday O
instructions O
that O
had O
been O
in O
place O
in O
the O
morning O
had O
suddenly O
changed O
. O

From O
the O
removal O
company O
I O
went O
home B-TER
and O
reported O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
then O
went O
to O
get O
food B-TER
for O
the O
people O
in O
our O
house B-TER
because O
we O
could O
no O
longer O
eat B-TER
at O
the O
Jewish O
restaurant B-TER
following O
its O
wrecking B-TER
. O

En O
route O
I O
visited O
a O
good O
friend O
as O
he O
had O
telephoned O
Mutter O
[ O
Mother O
] O
to O
say O
that O
I O
should O
not O
go O
into O
the O
city O
. O

Whilst O
I O
was O
there O
a O
man O
joined O
us O
and O
reported O
that O
the O
gangs O
were O
now O
going O
around O
private O
homes B-TER
smashing B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
and O
that O
the O
men B-TER
were O
going O
to O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

Immediately O
I O
then O
returned O
home B-TER
to O
Mutter O
and O
prepared O
her O
and O
the O
other O
people O
in O
the O
house B-TER
for O
a O
possible O
visit O
from O
these O
people O
. O

As O
I O
stood O
guard O
behind O
the O
curtains O
one O
of O
these O
gangs O
did O
indeed O
come O
down O
our O
street O
, O
however O
passed O
us O
by O
and O
turned O
round O
the O
corner O
. O

We O
then O
saw O
books B-TER
, O
cushions O
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
household O
goods O
etc O
. O

flying O
out O
of O
the O
windows O
onto O
the O
street O
three O
houses B-TER
down O
from O
our O
home B-TER
. O

It O
was O
essential O
to O
act O
in O
these O
minutes O
. O

Mutter O
kept O
saying O
I O
should O
not O
stay O
at O
home B-TER
. O

I O
therefore O
spent O
some O
time O
driving O
here O
and O
there O
around O
X. O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
destruction B-TER
was O
fully O
underway O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

I O
parked O
the O
car O
next O
to O
others O
on O
the O
roadside O
because O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
safe O
in O
the O
car O
any O
longer O
. O

Now O
walking O
around O
on O
foot O
with O
my O
briefcase O
containing O
the O
passports B-TER
and O
the O
visas B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
, O
I O
had O
to O
show O
utmost O
self O
- O
control O
and O
not O
run O
away O
if O
I O
came O
across O
one O
of O
these O
gangs O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
for O
it O
however O
but O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
onlookers O
and O
then O
disappear O
into O
thin O
air O
. O

Although O
I O
stayed O
close O
to O
home B-TER
I O
did O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
knowing O
that O
Mama O
was O
alone O
there O
with O
the O
old O
people O
. O

I O
telephoned O
Mama O
and O
we O
met O
in O
town O
as O
it O
had O
all O
pretty O
much O
come O
to O
an O
end O
there O
and O
the O
gangs O
were O
all O
now O
in O
the O
residential O
areas O
. O

Mama O
came O
over O
immediately O
with O
a O
sausage B-TER
and O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
everyone O
for O
lunch B-TER
. O

We O
drove O
past O
the O
furniture O
store O
and O
saw O
that O
nothing O
had O
happened O
there O
. O

( O
I O
later O
heard O
that O
that O
they O
had O
wanted O
to O
destroy O
everything O
there O
too O
, O
but O
the O
Aryan B-TER
removal O
man O
had O
been O
able O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

) O
We O
then O
decided O
to O
travel O
to O
Z. O
because O
we O
could O
not O
tell O
whether O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
X. O
was O
merely O
the O
result O
of O
local O
decision O
making O
. O

In O
any O
case O
Mutter O
had O
a O
doctor B-TER
's O
appointment O
in O
Z. O
that O
day O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
change O
the O
bandage B-TER
on O
her O
injured O
hand O
. O

We O
telephoned O
Z. O
and O
discovered O
that O
B. O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
, O
however O
, O
that O
they O
were O
intending O
to O
arrest B-TER
all O
the O
men B-TER
, O
because O
his O
deputy O
was O
on O
the O
phone O
. O

We O
ate O
the O
food B-TER
that O
Mama O
had O
brought O
along O
in O
the O
car O
en O
route O
. O

In O
Z. O
I O
rang O
acquaintances O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
men B-TER
had O
been O
taken O
away O
there O
as O
well O
, O
and O
that O
the O
same O
thing O
had O
happened O
to O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

We O
decided O
to O
travel O
to O
Y. O
next O
and O
then O
possibly O
from O
there O
visit O
the O
doctor B-TER
in O
X. O
In O
Y. O
we O
were O
told O
by O
... O
that O
all O
of O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
city O
by O
evening O
. O

... O
had O
not O
been O
taken O
and O
while O
we O
were O
there O
a O
Schupo O
[ O
uniformed B-TER
policeman B-TER
] O
turned O
up O
to O
demand O
a O
signature O
confirming O
that O
he O
would O
leave O
the O
city O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
then O
drove O
to O
Onkel O
[ O
uncle O
] O
C. O
who O
was O
packing O
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
went O
over O
to O
... O
. O

( O
In O
the O
meantime O
he O
has O
made O
it O
to O
Detroit B-LOC
with O
Tante O
[ O
aunt O
] O
. O

) O
We O
took O
C. O
and O
D. O
with O
us O
to O
X. O
to O
join O
their O
acquaintances O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
when O
we O
arrived O
in O
X. O
we O
telephoned O
our O
landlord O
and O
were O
told O
that O
nothing O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
there O
. O

So O
the O
day O
was O
finally O
over O
and O
we O
returned O
home B-TER
. O

One O
heard O
that O
everything O
had O
died O
down O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
yet O
one O
was O
not O
confident O
that O
someone O
would O
not O
still O
turn O
up O
and O
collect O
those O
who O
had O
been O
forgotten O
. O

Occasionally O
one O
could O
not O
sleep O
, O
one O
could O
not O
eat O
on O
account O
of O
the O
agitation O
, O
or O
one O
slept O
soundly O
and O
could O
also O
eat O
due O
to O
the O
agitation O
. O

Now O
one O
really O
could O
see O
misery O
everywhere O
. O

People O
kept O
arriving O
in O
X. O
from O
... O
and O
other O
towns O
because O
the O
Jews O
had O
been O
expelled O
from O
the O
... O
Gau O
. O

The O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
in O
... O
was O
burned O
out O
so O
the O
old O
people O
moved O
to O
the O
Jewish O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
and O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
... O
. O

Mattresses O
, O
bed O
linen O
etc O
. O

were O
quickly O
collected O
and O
the O
home B-TER
, O
which O
had O
not O
been O
affected O
, O
was O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
refugee B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
so O
overcrowded O
that O
the O
mattresses O
had O
to O
be O
laid O
out O
on O
the O
floor O
for O
the O
refugees B-TER
. O

Anyone O
who O
had O
acquaintances O
elsewhere O
tried O
to O
reach O
them O
in O
order O
to O
have O
somewhere O
to O
sleep O
and O
food B-TER
to O
eat B-TER
. O

People O
kept O
turning O
up O
at O
our O
place O
too O
until O
they O
could O
finally O
get O
to O
their O
acquaintances O
. O

The O
people O
arrived O
with O
a O
small O
suitcase O
or O
a O
bundle O
- O
just O
as O
in O
the O
pictures O
one O
has O
seen O
of O
refugees B-TER
in O
wartime B-TER
. O

It O
will O
doubtless O
interest O
you O
to O
know O
about O
what O
happened O
in O
... O
and O
we O
got O
to O
hear O
quite O
a O
bit O
because O
people O
were O
arriving O
all O
the O
time O
. O

It O
was O
bad O
because O
many O
people O
did O
not O
know O
where O
their O
relatives O
or O
acquaintances O
had O
ended O
up O
. O

Everything O
happened O
in O
such O
a O
rush O
that O
initially O
everyone O
had O
to O
see O
to O
their O
own O
affairs O
and O
then O
one O
would O
meet O
someone O
by O
chance O
who O
would O
be O
able O
to O
say O
where O
the O
others O
were O
. O

We O
heard O
the O
following O
about O
... O
from O
acquaintances O
who O
came O
from O
... O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
the O
synagogue B-TER
was O
already O
in O
flames B-TER
petrol O
had O
been O
poured O
during O
the O
night O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

Once O
it O
had O
burned B-TER
out I-TER
the O
synagogue B-TER
was O
blown O
up O
and O
is O
now O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
pile O
of O
stones O
surrounded O
by O
a O
wooden O
fence O
. O

Nothing O
happened O
to O
the O
cemetery B-TER
, O
and O
we O
visited O
Papa O
's O
grave B-TER
and O
that O
of O
our O
grandparents O
on O
the O
Sunday O
before O
we O
left O
. O

Papa O
died B-TER
six O
years O
ago O
on O
6th O
December O
and O
this O
time O
I O
could O
not O
go O
to O
a O
synagogue B-TER
to O
say O
Kaddish O
because O
they O
had O
all O
been O
destroyed B-TER
. O

On O
7th O
December O
we O
set O
off O
at O
2 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
for O
Amsterdam B-LOC
in O
... O
because O
I O
had O
a O
meeting O
at O
midday O
with O
... O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Germany B-LOC
any O
longer O
thereafter O
. O

In O
... O
everyone O
was O
expelled O
and O
had O
to O
leave O
... O
at O
midday O
. O

But O
before O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
train B-TER
there O
was O
an O
inspection O
at O
the O
platform O
barrier O
of O
the O
men B-TER
by O
the O
SS B-ORG
and O
of O
the O
women B-TER
by O
the O
Frauenschaft O
[ O
National O
Socialist O
Women O
’s O
League O
] O
. O

The O
Jews O
had O
their O
jewellery O
and O
money O
confiscated B-TER
, O
apart O
from O
some O
small O
change O
, O
so O
that O
they O
were O
virtually O
penniless O
when O
they O
arrived O
. O

The O
people O
were O
happy O
to O
have O
got O
away O
with O
their O
lives O
, O
the O
pictures O
were O
terrible O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
and O
the O
women B-TER
arrived O
in O
this O
state O
with O
their O
children B-TER
. O

And O
initially O
no O
one O
knew O
where O
the O
men B-TER
had O
been O
taken O
and O
what O
they O
would O
do O
to O
them O
. O

In O
... O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
were O
put O
in O
prison B-TER
and O
others O
taken O
to O
the O
Jewish O
café O
. O

Initially O
they O
lay O
on O
straw O
in O
the O
café O
and O
apparently O
they O
were O
not O
treated O
very O
nicely O
there O
either O
. O

From O
there O
the O
men B-TER
were O
sent O
to O
... O
and O
then O
transported B-TER
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

Three O
men B-TER
, O
including O
... O
, O
had O
their O
visas B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
were O
therefore O
released B-TER
in O
... O
. O

Initially O
no O
one O
dared O
go O
back O
to O
.... O
However O
one O
day O
the O
refugees B-TER
in O
... O
were O
suddenly O
expelled O
again O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
were O
supposed O
to O
return O
to O
where O
they O
had O
been O
living O
previously O
. O

People O
therefore O
really O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
should O
do O
because O
every O
town O
had O
its O
own O
arrangements O
- O
there O
were O
no O
longer O
any O
real O
laws B-TER
to O
speak O
of O
. O

In O
... O
it O
was O
particularly O
good O
because O
the O
Kreisleiter O
[ O
Nazi O
municipal O
leader O
] O
there O
was O
something O
of O
a O
hero O
when O
it O
came O
to O
these O
things O
. O

Almost O
all O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
were O
more O
or O
less O
wrecked B-TER
and O
more O
than O
a O
little O
had O
been O
stolen O
. O

First O
the O
women B-TER
were O
allowed O
back O
into O
the O
wrecked B-TER
homes B-TER
and O
had O
no O
idea O
where O
to O
begin O
clearing O
up O
. O

The O
homes B-TER
had O
been O
sealed O
by O
the O
police B-TER
and O
one O
first O
had O
to O
go O
there O
to O
get O
the O
key O
to O
gain O
access O
. O

Mama O
was O
with O
... O
who O
often O
used O
to O
visit O
us O
and O
who O
lived O
with O
... O
at O
her O
mother O
in O
law O
's O
in O
... O
She O
also O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
... O
in O
order O
to O
get O
into O
the O
flat B-TER
. O

They O
had O
forgotten O
to O
wreck B-TER
this O
flat B-TER
, O
which O
was O
also O
a O
stroke O
of O
luck O
for O
us O
because O
we O
had O
left O
our O
clock O
etc O
. O

there O
as O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
taken O
them O
to O
... O
because O
when O
Mama O
was O
in O
hospital B-TER
, O
initially O
I O
stayed O
with O
... O
in O
... O
. O

In O
... O
I O
ended O
up O
running O
a O
law B-TER
office O
pure O
and O
simple O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
women B-TER
discovered O
that O
I O
had O
not O
been O
taken O
away O
. O

Alongside O
my O
own O
affairs O
I O
had O
endless O
petitions O
to O
write O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
on O
behalf O
of O
acquaintances O
concerning O
the O
release B-TER
of O
the O
men B-TER
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

From O
time O
to O
time O
the O
men B-TER
were O
released B-TER
once O
they O
had O
received O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

This O
is O
where O
I O
also O
heard O
that O
... O
had O
been O
released B-TER
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
it O
is O
true O
but O
it O
may O
be O
the O
case O
because O
he O
had O
pushed O
ahead O
with O
his O
plan O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
USA B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
wrecking B-TER
old O
Herr O
X. O
, O
who O
suffered O
from O
a O
heart B-TER
condition I-TER
, O
had O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
. O

No O
one O
knows O
who O
buried B-TER
him O
because O
there O
were O
no O
men B-TER
left O
in O
... O
. O

A O
certain O
Herr O
Z. O
in O
... O
also O
died B-TER
of O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
Y. O
died B-TER
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

P. O
was O
apparently O
auf O
der O
Flucht O
erschossen O
[ O
shot B-TER
whilst O
escaping B-TER
] O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
clear O
picture O
of O
everything O
that O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
of O
course O
in O
all O
the O
excitement O
all O
kinds O
of O
rumours O
did O
the O
rounds O
which O
later O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
false O
. O

I O
myself O
could O
not O
return O
to O
... O
until O
the O
Sunday O
before O
our O
departure O
. O

Acquaintances O
and O
someone O
from O
the O
Kreisleitung O
with O
whom O
I O
had O
a O
telephone O
conversation O
advised O
me O
not O
to O
go O
to O
... O
. O

In O
our O
house B-TER
the O
whole O
of O
the O
first O
floor O
has O
been O
let O
to O
an O
army O
officer O
. O

On O
the O
second O
floor O
the O
large O
pane O
of O
glass O
in O
the O
corridor O
was O
smashed O
and O
the O
fine O
gentlemen O
moved O
on O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
our O
flat B-TER
was O
empty O
. O

Apparently O
they O
had O
also O
wrecked B-TER
the O
furniture O
on O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

Frau O
... O
had O
gone O
to O
her O
relatives O
. O

The O
flat B-TER
is O
let O
to O
a O
Feldwebel O
[ O
sergeant O
] O
and O
Frau O
... O
intended O
to O
give O
up O
the O
flat B-TER
once O
we O
had O
moved O
to O
... O
. O

On O
the O
Sunday O
after O
going O
to O
the O
cemetery B-TER
we O
went O
to O
visit O
... O
who O
was O
there O
that O
day O
. O

... O
is O
also O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
and O
... O
is O
with O
... O
staying O
with O
her O
[ O
their O
] O
parents O
. O

Her O
father O
was O
also O
picked O
up O
but O
released B-TER
again O
, O
and O
the O
brother O
picked O
up O
. O

It O
is O
barely O
possible O
to O
describe O
how O
... O
's O
flat B-TER
looked O
. O

The O
heavy O
furniture O
had O
been O
hacked O
up O
into O
firewood O
, O
the O
pictures O
slashed O
, O
all O
the O
crockery O
and O
mirrors O
smashed O
into O
a O
thousand O
pieces O
. O

This O
chaos O
was O
strewn O
around O
all O
the O
rooms O
. O

Only O
old O
and O
dirty O
linen O
remained O
, O
and O
the O
same O
with O
the O
suits O
. O

Silver O
and O
new O
things O
were O
all O
missing O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
imagine O
how O
it O
looked O
, O
and O
even O
with O
my O
descriptions O
you O
can O
not O
imagine O
how O
the O
wrecked B-TER
homes B-TER
looked O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
trying O
to O
describe O
it O
in O
any O
more O
detail O
because O
one O
would O
not O
know O
where O
to O
end O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
... O
's O
and O
there O
also O
much O
was O
wrecked B-TER
. O

... O
went O
with O
his O
family O
to O
... O
to O
stay O
with O
his O
brother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
also O
lodged O
with O
us O
. O

By O
now O
he O
will O
be O
on O
his O
way O
here O
and O
initially O
intended O
to O
go O
to O
Luxembourg B-LOC
until O
the O
steamer O
was O
due O
to O
depart O
, O
where O
... O
has O
emigrated B-TER
to O
. O

Onkel O
... O
also O
stayed O
with O
us O
and O
his O
place O
had O
also O
been O
completely O
wrecked B-TER
. O

He O
also O
wants O
to O
come O
here O
but O
is O
a O
long O
way O
down O
the O
registration B-TER
list O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

Elsbeth O
and O
her O
acquaintances O
have O
stood O
surety O
for O
him O
. O

We O
were O
in O
... O
for O
one O
night O
because O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
time O
during O
the O
day O
, O
and O
was O
out O
and O
about O
sorting O
out O
our O
emigration B-TER
every O
day O
. O

They O
had O
not O
wrecked B-TER
any O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
there O
and O
Kurt O
was O
not O
picked O
up O
. O

Tante O
Frieda O
is O
due O
to O
go O
to O
Sweden B-LOC
soon O
to O
stay O
with O
... O
. O

... O
has O
stood O
surety O
for O
... O
. O

... O
and O
... O
have O
not O
had O
any O
luck O
getting O
surety O
yet O
, O
but O
we O
hope O
to O
sort O
this O
out O
as O
well O
because O
they O
have O
a O
low O
number O
at O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

We O
hope O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
them O
out O
soon O
. O

On O
the O
street O
in O
... O
I O
met O
... O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
and O
he O
came O
round O
to O
me O
at O
midday O
. O

I O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
we O
have O
a O
visa B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Holland B-LOC
. O

He O
immediately O
wrote O
me O
an O
invitation O
from O
home B-TER
, O
and O
following O
my O
telephone O
conversation O
also O
had O
one O
from O
... O
. O

He O
had O
left O
Mannheim B-LOC
to O
stay O
with O
relatives O
and O
was O
imprisoned B-TER
there O
until O
he O
received O
a O
summons O
from O
the O
consulate B-TER
. O

However O
he O
was O
not O
badly O
off O
there O
and O
was O
happy O
not O
to O
have O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
stop O
describing O
all O
these O
wonderful O
things O
because O
I O
could O
go O
on O
for O
page O
after O
page O
and O
there O
is O
no O
point O
. O

From O
these O
lines O
you O
can O
get O
an O
impression O
of O
what O
these O
fine O
people O
we O
have O
been O
living O
with O
are O
like O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
there O
are O
also O
perfectly O
decent O
people O
there O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
something O
of O
this O
kind O
has O
happened O
in O
Germany B-LOC
in O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

You O
will O
now O
doubtless O
understand O
why O
I O
began O
by O
quoting O
the O
motto O
of O
the O
speaker O
at O
the O
Chanukah O
celebration O
, O
and O
just O
want O
to O
mention O
once O
again O
that O
these O
occurrences O
should O
remain O
in O
the O
memory O
not O
only O
of O
this O
generation O
but O
also O
the O
next O
, O
and O
that O
no O
Jew O
should O
ever O
forget O
something O
of O
this O
kind O
. O

Children O
of O
Israel O
, O
do O
not O
forget O
what O
Amalek O
did O
to O
you O
. O

However O
now O
I O
just O
want O
to O
mention O
briefly O
all O
the O
things O
that O
at O
the O
time O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
for O
emigration B-TER
. O

I O
am O
not O
doing O
this O
just O
so O
that O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
all O
the O
things O
I O
had O
to O
do O
, O
but O
rather O
so O
that O
you O
will O
understand O
if O
and O
when O
you O
ask O
yourselves O
whether O
this O
or O
that O
could O
not O
have O
been O
sorted O
out O
first O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
were O
summoned O
to O
the O
consulate B-TER
on O
9th O
August O
thanks O
to O
the O
surety O
stood O
for O
us O
by O
... O
. O

Because O
a O
formality O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
with O
the O
surety O
we O
only O
received O
our O
visas B-TER
on O
12th O
September O
. O

It O
goes O
without O
saying O
that O
at O
the O
time O
I O
immediately O
delivered O
the O
letter B-TER
to O
the O
Brazilian B-LOC
consulate B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
time O
the O
secretary O
in O
the O
consulate B-TER
told O
me O
it O
could O
take O
three O
months O
and O
Mama O
should O
be O
grateful O
if O
she O
got O
a O
visa B-TER
at O
all O
as O
there O
was O
only O
one O
letter B-TER
of O
recommendation O
. O

As O
I O
have O
already O
told O
you O
, O
Mama O
did O
get O
her O
visa B-TER
so O
it O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
write O
about O
that O
all O
over O
again O
. O

I O
also O
applied O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Uruguay B-LOC
. O

To O
this O
end O
I O
handed O
over O
RM O
. O

1,000.- O
for O
both O
of O
us O
. O

The O
visa B-TER
was O
to O
be O
issued O
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
and O
the O
consul B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
told O
me O
I O
should O
pack O
everything O
and O
then O
travel O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
. O

There O
I O
would O
receive O
the O
visa B-TER
once O
the O
formalities O
had O
been O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

Yet O
during O
this O
period O
there O
was O
the O
business B-TER
with O
Argentina B-LOC
where O
people O
prepared O
everything O
and O
were O
then O
banned O
from O
going O
, O
so O
they O
did O
not O
get O
their O
visa B-TER
in O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
they O
had O
given O
up O
their O
homes B-TER
and O
had O
no O
visas B-TER
. O

For O
this O
reason O
the O
whole O
thing O
with O
Uruguay B-LOC
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
too O
risky O
because O
I O
could O
not O
get O
the O
visa B-TER
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
before O
everything O
was O
packed O
. O

This O
is O
all O
sorted O
now O
and O
I O
have O
taken O
the O
paperwork O
with O
me O
in O
case O
it O
comes O
in O
useful O
at O
some O
point O
. O

So O
at O
this O
critical O
point O
Mama O
had O
her O
visa B-TER
for O
the O
USA B-LOC
and O
so O
did O
I. O
We O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Frankfurt B-LOC
a O
number O
of O
times O
until O
Mama O
got O
the O
Brazilian B-LOC
visa B-TER
. O

E.g. O
we O
were O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
one O
day O
when O
they O
were O
still O
arresting B-TER
people O
there O
, O
although O
the O
Aktion O
[ O
operation O
] O
, O
as O
they O
called O
the O
whole O
thing O
, O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
died O
down O
. O

The O
Uruguayan B-LOC
consul B-TER
advised O
me O
to O
go O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
immediately O
and O
leave O
on O
the O
next O
ship B-TER
because O
they O
were O
still O
going O
to O
round O
up O
more O
people O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
it O
was O
a O
major O
struggle O
to O
keep O
one O
's O
head O
during O
this O
period O
. O

There O
were O
long O
queues O
of O
Jews O
at O
the O
consulates B-TER
and O
the O
offices O
of O
the O
shipping B-TER
lines I-TER
and O
the O
faces O
of O
these O
beleaguered O
people O
were O
a O
terrible O
sight O
to O
behold O
. O

You O
now O
know O
all O
about O
the O
visa B-TER
question O
. O

Then O
the O
containers O
had O
to O
be O
sorted O
out O
, O
because O
we O
were O
fortunate O
in O
that O
our O
furniture O
had O
not O
been O
smashed O
to O
pieces O
. O

Because O
we O
had O
moved O
to O
... O
on O
10th O
October O
the O
relevant O
Devisenstelle O
[ O
foreign O
currency O
office O
] O
for O
us O
was O
in O
... O
, O
and O
they O
were O
much O
more O
conciliatory O
there O
than O
at O
the O
office O
in O
... O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
been O
registered B-TER
in O
... O
for O
four O
weeks O
I O
intended O
to O
submit O
the O
application O
for O
permission O
to O
pack O
to O
the O
office O
in O
... O
. O

The O
cutlery O
and O
the O
linen O
had O
already O
been O
packed O
into O
containers O
ready O
for O
the O
move O
to O
... O
. O

So O
immediately O
after O
10th O
November O
I O
submitted O
the O
list O
of O
what O
we O
were O
taking O
in O
... O
, O
because O
you O
had O
to O
have O
lived O
in O
... O
for O
some O
time O
before O
it O
could O
be O
dealt O
with O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
some O
electrical O
equipment O
from O
a O
Jewish O
family O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
these O
people O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
on O
10th O
November O
. O

So O
once O
we O
had O
collected O
the O
things O
we O
had O
bought O
from O
the O
wives B-TER
of O
the O
business B-TER
owners O
we O
had O
to O
submit O
a O
supplementary O
list O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
buy O
some O
photo O
equipment O
for O
myself O
but O
the O
Devisenstelle O
would O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
take O
it O
. O

We O
only O
had O
to O
make O
a O
small O
duty O
payment O
to O
the O
Golddiskontbank O
[ O
gold O
discount O
bank O
] O
for O
the O
new O
things O
, O
and O
in O
this O
respect O
got O
off O
very O
lightly O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
I O
had O
a O
Unbedenklichkeitsschein O
[ O
clearance O
certificate O
] O
for O
both O
of O
us O
from O
the O
Finanzamt O
[ O
tax B-TER
office O
] O
in O
... O
and O
the O
city O
of O
.... O
We O
now O
heard O
that O
no O
more O
of O
these O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
were O
being O
distributed O
, O
and O
that O
before O
one O
could O
be O
drawn O
up O
people O
would O
have O
to O
make O
the O
20 O
% O
Kontribution O
[ O
on O
Jews O
for O
the O
cost O
of O
Novemberaktion O
damage O
] O
. O

Yet O
as O
I O
have O
already O
explained O
to O
you O
, O
no O
one O
was O
allowed O
to O
sell O
securities O
, O
so O
how O
was O
I O
supposed O
to O
pay O
this O
20 O
% O
and O
on O
top O
of O
that O
the O
Reichsfluchtsteuer O
[ O
Reich B-TER
flight O
tax B-TER
] O
for O
Mama O
, O
which O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
paid O
. O

The O
time O
limit O
offered O
protection O
, O
and O
I O
had O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
extended O
again O
and O
again O
. O

But O
during O
that O
period O
one O
only O
went O
to O
the O
authorities B-TER
with O
some O
trepidation O
, O
because O
one O
did O
not O
know O
if O
one O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
after O
all O
if O
someone O
caught O
sight O
of O
one O
there O
. O

In O
the O
... O
they O
recently O
also O
instigated O
an O
accounts B-TER
check O
. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
usually O
the O
Zollfahndung O
[ O
customs O
investigation B-TER
] O
, O
which O
checked O
every O
last O
detail O
with O
a O
fine O
toothcomb O
. O

So O
I O
made O
photocopies O
of O
all O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsscheine O
that O
I O
had O
, O
then O
had O
them O
witnessed O
by O
a O
notary O
and O
used O
these O
documents O
instead O
. O

I O
frequently O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Devisenstelle O
in O
... O
and O
then O
received O
permission O
for O
Mama O
to O
pack O
, O
though O
in O
my O
case O
there O
were O
still O
some O
questions O
to O
be O
answered O
. O

Following O
various O
visits O
to O
the O
Devisenstelle O
the O
official O
told O
me O
they O
did O
not O
recognise O
me O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
Unbedenklichkeitsschein O
I O
was O
able O
to O
ensure O
that O
I O
could O
pack O
as O
well O
. O

However O
when O
he O
then O
informed O
me O
that O
the O
outstanding O
question O
had O
not O
been O
answered O
I O
thought O
again O
that O
I O
might O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

Two O
days O
after O
receiving O
the O
Packgenehmigung O
[ O
packing O
permit O
] O
we O
filled O
both O
of O
the O
containers O
and O
the O
suitcases O
and O
had O
everything O
sent O
to O
Rotterdam B-LOC
. O

Through O
a O
notary O
I O
had O
already O
made O
sure O
that O
... O
had O
been O
sent O
power O
of O
attorney O
over O
everything O
and O
arranged O
that O
I O
would O
write O
to O
him O
from O
Holland B-LOC
. O

He O
would O
then O
sort O
out O
the O
Reichsfluchtsteuer O
and O
the O
20 O
% O
Kontribution O
with O
the O
Finanzamt O
. O

I O
am O
now O
waiting O
for O
a O
reply O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
he O
has O
done O
so O
. O

I O
wrote O
to O
him O
from O
Holland B-LOC
once O
the O
containers O
had O
arrived O
in O
Rotterdam B-LOC
so O
that O
they O
did O
not O
get O
held O
up O
for O
any O
reason O
. O

We O
could O
not O
transfer B-TER
anything O
under O
these O
circumstances O
and O
I O
was O
told O
that O
for O
the O
time O
being O
no O
Sperrmark O
[ O
blocked O
Marks O
] O
were O
being O
sold O
. O

However O
in O
Holland B-LOC
I O
heard O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
after O
all O
, O
and O
will O
see O
what O
remains O
after O
the O
taxes B-TER
have O
been O
paid O
and O
how O
it O
can O
be O
transferred B-TER
. O

We O
spent O
a O
week O
in O
Holland B-LOC
and O
boarded O
ship B-TER
in O
Rotterdam B-LOC
on O
the O
13th O
of O
this O
month O
. O
