The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
My O
father B-TER
was O
a O
grocer O
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

He O
had O
two O
houses O
, O
the O
third O
one O
had O
just O
started O
to O
be O
built O
then O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
a O
five O
- O
room O
flat O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
my O
two O
siblings O
; O
my O
father O
was O
definitely O
considered O
a O
rich O
man O
. O

He O
buried O
somewhere O
a O
lot O
of O
money B-TER
, O
jewellery O
and O
receipts O
written O
by O
his O
Christian O
friends O
stating O
what O
and O
how O
much O
they O
had O
accepted O
from O
him O
for O
safekeeping O
. O

He O
, O
the O
poor O
man O
, O
died B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
at O
home O
as O
yet O
and O
I O
do O
not O
know O
where O
he O
buried O
those O
valuables O
, O
so O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
I O
can O
ever O
get O
hold O
of O
them O
. O

My O
father O
was O
, O
on O
account O
of O
his O
decorations O
earned O
in O
the O
other O
war O
, O
exempt O
from O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
together O
with O
his O
whole O
family O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wear O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
and O
when O
all O
the O
other O
Jews O
from O
Kassa B-LOC
were O
sent O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
told O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
go O
there O
. O

Yet O
, O
this O
was O
the O
time O
when O
my O
father O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
safe O
place O
for O
his O
valuables O
. O

Although O
, O
some O
days O
later O
a O
gendarme B-TER
appeared O
and O
said O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
. O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
another O
one O
came O
and O
said O
we O
could O
stay O
. O

It O
went O
on O
like O
that O
for O
days O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
continuous O
anxiety O
; O
finally O
one O
day O
they O
took B-TER
us I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
ghetto I-TER
nevertheless O
. O

We O
had O
to O
get O
ready O
within O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
we O
could O
take O
with O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
. O

I O
could O
have O
escaped O
but O
my O
parents O
insisted O
on O
our O
staying O
together O
. O

If O
they O
had O
suspected O
that O
our O
being O
together O
would O
last O
for O
such O
a O
short O
time O
, O
they O
might O
have O
let O
me O
escape B-TER
. O

They O
crammed O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
brickyard O
of O
Kassa B-LOC
, O
plenty O
of O
people O
in O
a O
very O
small O
place O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

We O
lived O
mostly O
on O
what O
we O
had O
brought O
with O
us O
. O

Chief O
inspector O
Dr O
Csatári B-PER
was O
continuously O
beating O
people B-TER
with O
a O
dog O
whip O
. O

When O
it O
came O
to O
his O
mind O
, O
he O
went O
in O
the O
block O
and O
he O
hit B-TER
whomever O
he O
found O
there O
with O
the O
dog O
whip O
. O

On O
one O
occasion O
he O
ordered O
through O
a O
microphone O
every O
young O
girl B-TER
to O
come O
out O
. O

He O
took O
them O
out O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
dig O
out O
thick O
wooden O
stakes O
from O
the O
ground O
with O
their O
hands O
. O

Even O
the O
SS B-TER
soldiers I-TER
were O
scandalized O
by O
this O
; O
they O
said O
that O
for O
them O
, O
such O
things O
are O
done O
with O
spades O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
brickyard O
. O

We O
were O
told O
that O
we O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
do O
agricultural O
work B-TER
but O
we O
would O
stay O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. I-LOC

We O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
believe O
this O
, O
but O
we O
found O
it O
suspicious O
that O
German B-TER
soldiers I-TER
were O
there O
with O
us O
. O

One O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
they O
woke O
us O
up O
at O
4 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Policemen B-TER
occupied O
the O
brickyard O
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
gather O
at O
a O
large O
place O
and O
stand O
there O
in O
the O
blazing O
sun O
till O
3 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

They O
did O
not O
let O
us O
eat B-TER
or O
go O
for O
water O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
escaped B-TER
even O
from O
there O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
pillow O
and O
a O
duvet O
with O
us O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

72 O
people B-TER
were O
in O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
together O
with O
plenty O
of O
bedclothes O
and O
packages O
of O
food B-TER
. O

It O
was O
terribly O
hot O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
and O
we O
were O
horribly O
thirsty O
. O

After O
a O
three O
- O
day O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
21st O
May O
. O

We O
had O
to O
jump O
out O
of O
the O
cattle B-TER
cars I-TER
and O
we O
were O
told O
to O
leave O
our O
baggage O
there O
, O
they O
would O
be O
sent O
after O
us O
. O

They O
lined B-TER
us I-TER
up I-TER
and O
by O
the O
time O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
what O
was O
happening O
I O
had O
been O
in O
a O
group O
with O
one O
of O
my O
younger O
brothers O
but O
without O
my O
father O
. O

We O
who O
were O
able O
to O
work B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
the O
bath O
; O
they O
stripped O
us O
naked O
and O
bathed O
us O
, O
then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
block O
No O
. O

13 O
. O

5 O
people B-TER
had O
to O
find O
space O
on O
one O
berth O
. O

We O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
and O
then O
the O
overseer B-TER
came O
in O
and O
struck O
us O
with O
a O
truncheon O
. O

That O
was O
the O
first O
beating O
. O

We O
lined O
up O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
Appell O
and O
if O
somebody O
was O
not O
standing O
as O
upright O
as O
a O
ramrod O
, O
they O
struck O
him O
. O

Those O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
toilet O
were O
also O
beaten B-TER
up I-TER
. O

Three O
days O
later O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Wolfsberg B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
put O
in O
tents B-TER
made O
of O
cardboard O
, O
3 O
metres O
in O
diameter O
, O
20 O
people B-TER
in O
each O
. O

We O
did O
a O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
there O
, O
first O
at O
road O
construction O
, O
then O
chiselled O
concrete O
in O
a O
tunnel O
. O

Our O
provisions O
consisted O
of O
1/3 O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
some O
black O
coffee B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
and O
some O
soup B-TER
without O
any O
content O
. O

We O
starved B-TER
terribly O
and O
became O
very O
weak O
. O

If O
they O
saw O
somebody O
getting O
hold O
of O
a O
raw O
potato B-TER
, O
he O
received O
25 O
strikes O
on O
his O
soles O
and O
they O
took O
the O
potato B-TER
away O
. O

One O
of O
their O
favourite O
punishments O
was O
that O
when O
we O
came O
back O
from O
work B-TER
and O
were O
tired O
, O
they O
made O
us O
do O
somersaults O
, O
or O
we O
had O
to O
be O
crouching O
or O
jumping O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
. O

They O
called O
it O
doing O
sports O
. O

After O
12 O
hours O
of O
hard O
work B-TER
and O
being O
provisioned O
like O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
survive O
. O

10 O
- O
12 O
people B-TER
died B-TER
every O
day O
. O

My O
leg O
developed O
a O
tumour B-TER
and O
I O
had O
already O
been O
very O
weak O
then O
, O
so O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
hospital B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
four O
months O
in O
hospital B-TER
and O
my O
leg O
was O
operated O
on O
but O
I O
could O
not O
regain O
my O
strength O
after O
that O
. O

It O
happened O
sometimes O
that O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
did O
not O
give O
the O
patients O
food B-TER
for O
a O
day O
. O

I O
was O
discharged O
from O
hospital B-TER
on O
15th O
January O
and O
they O
took O
me O
to O
Wüstegiesdorf B-LOC
. O

800 O
people B-TER
lived O
there O
in O
a O
big O
building B-TER
. O

I O
was O
very O
glad O
, O
because O
that O
camp B-TER
was O
clean O
and O
washing O
in O
hot O
water O
was O
a O
daily O
obligation O
. O

The O
provisions O
were O
better O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
we O
could O
go O
to O
the O
city O
and O
there O
we O
could O
acquire O
some O
food B-TER
. O

I O
was O
a O
gatekeeper O
and O
for O
this O
I O
received O
double O
rations B-TER
. O

Much O
to O
my O
delight O
I O
met O
one O
of O
my O
uncles O
there O
, O
who O
worked O
at O
the O
kitchen O
and O
always O
gave O
me O
a O
little O
food B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
approaching O
, O
two O
of O
our O
comrades O
escaped B-TER
. O

We O
were O
packed O
up O
and O
we O
marched B-TER
70 O
kilometres O
within O
2 O
days O
in O
terrible O
cold O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Qualisch B-LOC
on O
a O
Monday O
, O
but O
we O
were O
given O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
only O
on O
Friday O
. O

We O
suffered O
terribly O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

What O
the O
peasants O
threw O
away O
, O
like O
rotten O
potatoes B-TER
or O
turnips B-TER
, O
we O
picked O
up O
from O
the O
rubbish O
pile O
and O
ate O
them O
. O

We O
already O
looked O
so O
bad O
that O
we O
did O
not O
even O
like O
to O
look O
at O
each O
other O
. O

Finally O
they O
put O
us O
in O
open O
freight O
cars O
, O
60 O
people B-TER
in O
each O
. O

We O
were O
travelling O
for O
six O
days O
; O
it O
was O
snowing O
and O
we O
were O
suffering O
terribly O
from O
cold O
too O
. O

6 O
people O
died B-TER
in O
my O
freight O
car O
during O
that O
journey O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
went O
mad O
. O

800 O
people B-TER
started O
from O
Wüstegiesdorf B-LOC
and O
500 O
of O
us O
arrived O
in O
Hildesheim B-LOC
. O

And O
from O
those O
only O
400 O
were O
able O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
rebuild O
a O
train O
station O
destroyed O
by O
bombs B-TER
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
work B-TER
to O
carry O
rails O
and O
sleepers O
when O
we O
had O
already O
been O
almost O
unable O
to O
drag O
ourselves O
along O
. O

The O
provisions O
were O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
every O
day O
. O

We O
received O
1/6 O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
soup B-TER
once O
a O
day O
, O
but O
it O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
bread B-TER
was O
omitted O
. O

The O
following O
case O
made O
a O
terrible O
impression O
on O
me O
: O
a O
freight O
car O
containing O
food B-TER
destroyed O
by O
a O
bomb B-TER
was O
standing O
on O
the O
train O
station O
. O

Those O
who O
could O
tried O
to O
get O
some O
food B-TER
from O
it O
. O

One O
of O
the O
Scharführers B-TER
saw O
when O
a O
boy B-TER
of O
14 O
hid O
a O
tin O
of O
food B-TER
under O
his O
jacket O
. O

He O
ordered O
the O
boy B-TER
to O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
pressed O
his O
gun O
to O
his O
temple O
. O

The O
child B-TER
began O
to O
beg O
, O
so O
he O
removed O
the O
revolver O
from O
there O
but O
he O
put O
it O
back O
in O
a O
minute O
. O

This O
game O
repeated O
again O
and O
again O
and O
it O
was O
awful O
to O
hear O
the O
fear O
of O
death B-TER
in O
the O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
voice O
, O
he O
was O
practically O
howling O
and O
whimpering O
of O
fear O
. O

When O
the O
German B-TER
soldier I-TER
became O
bored O
with O
this O
amusement O
, O
he O
grabbed O
both O
hands O
of O
the O
child B-TER
and O
shot B-TER
him I-TER
in O
the O
head O
. O

There O
was O
another O
case O
when O
a O
prisoner B-TER
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
but O
he O
was O
caught O
. O

The O
whole O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
appear O
at O
the O
hanging B-TER
and O
the O
boy B-TER
's O
father B-TER
was O
placed O
in O
the O
first O
row O
, O
right O
next O
to O
the O
gallows O
; O
he O
had O
to O
watch O
his O
son B-TER
’s I-TER
death B-TER
till O
the O
end O
. O

In O
Belsen B-LOC
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
got O
typhus B-TER
. I-TER

We O
had O
to O
carry O
or O
pull O
the O
corpses B-TER
in O
our O
arms O
to O
the O
place O
of O
collection O
. O

In O
Hannover B-LOC
, O
we O
worked B-TER
all O
the O
time O
at O
night O
in O
a O
tunnel O
; O
they O
said O
they O
were O
building O
an O
underground O
airplane O
factory O
. O

They O
beat O
us O
awfully O
there O
. O

Hits O
were O
raining O
upon O
us O
practically O
every O
minute O
. O

People B-TER
were O
falling O
down O
like O
flies O
in O
the O
autumn O
. O

We O
received O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
every O
other O
day O
. O

We O
were O
suffering O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

It O
happened O
there O
that O
one O
wretch O
cut O
some O
flesh O
out O
of O
the O
thigh O
of O
a O
dead B-TER
man I-TER
and O
he O
also O
took O
his O
lungs O
out O
. O

The O
dead B-TER
man I-TER
’s I-TER
fellows O
saw O
that O
and O
they O
took O
the O
man O
to O
the O
back O
and O
they O
beat O
him O
until O
he O
collapsed O
full O
of O
blood O
. O

When O
he O
recovered O
consciousness O
, O
they O
began O
to O
beat O
him O
again O
until O
he O
died B-TER
. O

I O
will O
never O
forget O
that O
horrible O
episode O
. O

An O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
shot O
dead B-TER
a O
physician B-TER
called O
Schönstein B-PER
, O
because O
he O
had O
gone O
out O
to O
pick O
some O
carrots B-TER
. O

When O
the O
English O
came B-TER
in I-TER
, O
they O
only O
found O
skeletons O
in O
our O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
belonged O
already O
to O
the O
dead B-TER
, O
rather O
than O
living O
people O
. O
