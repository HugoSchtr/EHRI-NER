I O
must O
say O
that O
my O
impression O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
rule O
becomes O
more O
pessimistic O
each O
time O
. O

Namely O
, O
the O

in O
the O
German B-TER
- I-TER
occupied I-TER
areas I-TER
, O
under O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
, O
deteriorates O
more O
and O
more O
. O

The O
high O

of O
the O
German O
authorities B-TER
, O
coupled O
with O
the O
complex O

, O
are O
fanning O

the O

However O
, O
on O
the O

its O
pace O

extremely O
slow O

there O
is O
nothing O

Lublin B-LOC

the O

efforts O
have O
just O
started O
under O
the O
General B-TER

as O
stated O

given O
the O
abundant O
labor B-TER
force I-TER
and O
the O
superior O
organizational O
capacity O
of O
the O
authorities B-TER

the O
efforts O
should O
bear O
fruit O
. O

At O

toward O

total O
oppression B-TER

Its O
ultimate O
political O
objective O
appears O
to O
be O
erasing O
Polishness O

or O
at O
least O
preventing O
Poles B-TER
from O
becoming O
a O
political O
force O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
is O
done O
through O
depriving O
them O
of O
ethnic B-TER
identity I-TER
by O
destroying O

The O

the O

are O
sent O
to O
Germany B-LOC
by O
the O
compulsory B-TER

their O
tragedy O

a O
separation B-TER

As O

Currently O

approximately O
two O

Jews B-TER
live O
under O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
. O

The O
authorities B-TER
are O
taking O
a O
cautious O
consideration O
in O
dealing O
with O
them O
. O

Namely O
, O
initially O
they O
were O
to O
be O
concentrated B-TER
in O
certain O
parts O
( O
Lublin B-LOC
District O
) O
so O
as O
to O
be O
cut O
off O
from O
interactions O
with O
the O
German O
and O
Polish O
peoples B-TER
. O

Due O
to O
technical O
difficulties O
, O
this O
was O
not O
a O
success O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
policy B-TER
of O
local O
( O
settlement O
) O
was O
adopted O
, O
so O
as O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
in O
their O
current O
areas O
of O
inhabitance O
. O

The O
law B-TER
forbidding O
Jews B-TER
to O
use O
the O
railway B-TER
, O
enacted O
on O
January O
26 O
, O
1940 O
, O
is O
an O
affirmation O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
local O
rule O
. O

However O
, O
Jews B-TER
were O
expelled O
from O
Krakow B-LOC
( O
August O
1940 O
) O
. O

It O
appeared O
like O
the O
principle O
of O
local O
illegible O
was O
to O
be O
abandoned O
. O

However O
, O
no O
further O
development O
has O
happened O
till O
the O
present O
. O

In O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
a O
relatively O
high O
concentration B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
live O
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
Radom B-LOC
, O
Lublin B-LOC
and O
other O
major O
cities O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
areas O
are O
completed O
cut B-TER
off I-TER
from O
the O
rest O
by O
concrete O
walls O
. O

The O
authorities B-TER
set O
up O
administrative O
units O
called O
Judenrat B-TER
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O

By O
controlling O
the O
masses O
through O
Judenrat B-TER
the O
authorities B-TER
seek O
to O
simplify O
their O
rule O
. O

These O
Judenrat B-TER
are O
based O
on O
the O
Law B-TER
establishing O
Judenrat B-TER
, O
promulgated B-TER
on O
November O
28 O
, O
1940 O
. O

The O
content O
of O
this O
law B-TER
is O
as O
follows O
: O
Through O
its O
Chairman B-TER
and I-TER
Vice I-TER
Chairmen I-TER
, O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
is O
obliged O
to O
follow O
orders O
from O
the O
German O
Authorities B-TER
; O
it O
is O
also O
responsible O
for O
fully O
implementing O
these O
orders O
. O

Jews B-TER
must O
faithfully O
follow O
orders O
issued O
by O
Judenrat B-TER
so O
as O
to O
implement O
the O
orders O
from O
the O
German O
Authorities O
. O

Although O
Judenrat B-TER
vary O
in O
size O
from O
locality O
to O
locality O
, O
they O
generally O
have O
the O
following O
agencies O
: O

public O

so O
on O

are O
under O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O

However O
, O
as O
Nazi B-TER

knows O

very O
well O
from O
its O
