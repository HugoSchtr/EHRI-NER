a O
prisoner B-TER
in O
the O
Terezín B-LOC
, O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
and O
Blechhammer B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

On O
28.09.1944 O
we O
were O
loaded O
( O
1st O
transport B-TER
) O
in O
Terezín B-LOC
and O
went O
with O
the O
strong O
opinion O
, O
that O
we O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
Germany B-TER
to O
work B-TER
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Bautzen B-LOC
we O
became O
much O
more O
unsure O
about O
the O
destination O
. O

In O
Görlitz B-LOC
already O
we O
were O
all O
agreed O
, O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
the O
more O
or O
less O
famous O
Birkenau B-LOC
Ghetto O
. O

The O
only O
other O
was O
out O
, O
was O
that O
we O
would O
end O
up O
in O
the O
Glatzer O
coal O
mines O
. O

The O
hope O
became O
weaker O
and O
weaker O
, O
and O
as O
we O
finally O
arrived O
in O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
was O
completely O
gone O
. O

We O
arrived O
on O
a O
large O
, O
open O
train O
station O
tracks O
when O
suddenly O
the O
doors O
burst O
violently O
open O
and O
we O
heard O
only O
these O
words O
: O
Everybody O
out O
, O
luggage O
stays O
in O
the O
carriage O
. O

The O
first O
things O
that O
we O
saw O
was O
electrified O
barbed O
wire O
on O
both O
sides O
with O
electric O
lamps O
every O
5 O
meters O
. O

Further O
away O
, O
we O
saw O
a O
chimney O
, O
that O
had O
a O
giant O
red O
flam O
coming O
out O
of O
it O
. O

It O
was O
– O
we O
would O
later O
discover O
– O
one O
of O
the O
five O
furnaces B-TER
, O
that O
worked B-TER
night O
and O
day O
. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
annihilation B-TER
and O
concentration B-TER
camp O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
line O
up O
in O
fives O
alongside O
the O
train O
and O
were O
shown O
to O
a O
big O
, O
strong O
SS B-TER
-Hauptsturmführer O
who O
sorted O
us O
. O

( O
Dr. O
Schwarz B-PER
) O
The O
weak O
, O
ill B-TER
, O
elderly O
and O
those O
younger O
than O
14 O
- O
16 O
years O
were O
led O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
the O
left O
. O

Those O
of O
us O
who O
were O
left O
( O
from O
the O
transport B-TER
of O
2500 O
, O
1100 O
were O
left O
) O
went O
to O
camp B-TER
on O
the O
right O
. O

Now O
that O
we O
had O
arrived O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
SS B-TER
told O
us O
that O
this O
camp B-TER
is O
the O
Auschwitz B-LOC
camp O
, O
that O
people B-TER
who O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
work B-TER
are O
gassed B-TER
here O
, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
us O
is O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
work B-TER
, O
and O
that O
we O
would O
get O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

We O
were O
led O
into O
the O
sauna O
, O
undressed O
completely O
, O
shaved O
, O
bathed O
and O
got O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

The O
clothes B-TER
were O
the O
German B-TER
prison B-TER
uniform O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
led O
into O
the O
actual O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
was O
divided O
into O
two O
barracks B-TER
and O
the O
camp B-TER
senior O
– O
a O
German B-TER
felon O
– O
explained O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
to O
us O
. O

When O
this O
was O
finished O
, O
we O
were O
chased O
out O
of O
the O
block O
in O
order O
to O
spend O
the O
long O
, O
beautiful O
day O
outside O
. O

At O
1PM O
we O
got O
our O
first O
meal B-TER
. O

It O
was O
¾ O
of O
a O
litre O
of O
pumpkin B-TER
soup I-TER
that O
was O
inedible O
for O
a O
cultivated O
person O
. O

But O
we O
were O
starving B-TER
and O
when O
a O
person O
is O
hungry B-TER
, O
he O
will O
eat B-TER
everything O
. O

This O
amazing O
lunch B-TER
was O
given O
to O
us O
in O
dirty O
bowls O
, O
or O
if O
you O
were O
especially O
lucky O
, O
in O
washing O
bowls O
. O

Altogether O
, O
there O
was O
about O
30 O
bowls O
available O
for O
1000 O
people B-TER
. O

The O
meal B-TER
had O
to O
be O
finished O
with O
30 O
minutes O
. O

Spoons O
, O
or O
other O
such O
items O
used O
by O
people B-TER
daily O
, O
were O
a O
rarity O
for O
us O
and O
none O
of O
us O
thought O
about O
them O
anymore O
. O

And O
so O
, O
we O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
outside O
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barrack B-TER
, O
until O
at O
about O
7PM O
when O
there O
was O
dinner B-TER
. O

This O
consisted O
of O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
a O
spoonful O
of O
marmalade B-TER
and O
a O
slice O
of O
sausage B-TER
that O
could O
only O
be O
seen O
through O
a O
magnifying O
glass O
. O

After O
this O
extensive O
evening O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
were O
chases O
into O
the O
barracks B-TER
in O
order O
to O
sleep O
. O

However O
, O
what O
one O
usually O
understands O
as O
sleep O
and O
lying O
down O
of O
course O
did O
n’t O
apply O
here O
. O

Five O
of O
us O
sat O
on O
a O
freezing O
cold O
, O
concrete O
floor O
and O
fought O
over O
space O
until O
one O
or O
another O
fell O
asleep O
more O
or O
less O
tired O
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
forced O
out O
of O
these O
wonderful O
four O
- O
poster O
beds O
and O
the O
terrible O
, O
new O
and O
oh O
so O
long O
day O
would O
begin O
. O

Three O
times O
a O
day O
we O
had O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
so O
that O
nobody O
could O
escape B-TER
and O
tell O
the O
world O
how O
nice O
, O
wonderful O
and O
cultivated O
life O
was O
under O
the O
liberators O
of O
Europe O
. O

It O
went O
on O
like O
this O
for O
six O
days O
, O
until O
we O
were O
finally O
allocated O
to O
a O
work B-TER
transport I-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
nobody O
knew O
where O
it O
was O
going O
, O
the O
main O
thing O
was O
getting O
out O
of O
this O
inferno O
of O
death O
and O
the O
Devil O
. O

After O
we O
got O
new O
clothes B-TER
and O
were O
bathed O
clean O
, O
we O
were O
brought O
to O
a O
train O
station O
– O
envied O
by O
those O
who O
had O
to O
stay O
behind O
– O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
our O
new O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
travelled O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
until O
we O
arrived O
at O
our O
destination O
at O
about O
11PM O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
we O
were O
in O
Gleiwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
a O
camp B-TER
, O
given O
our O
first O
good O
soup O
and O
sent O
to O
bed O
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
awoken O
and O
presented O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

We O
heard O
now O
officially O
that O
we O
were O
in O
the O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
Gleiwitz B-LOC
I I-LOC
, O
which O
belonged O
to O
the O
RAW B-ORG
( I-ORG
Reich I-ORG
Railway I-ORG
Improvement I-ORG
Works I-ORG
) I-ORG
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
work B-TER
that O
factory O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
Camp B-TER
Commandant O
Moll B-PER
explained O
to O
us O
that O
we O
would O
have O
it O
good O
– O
good O
food B-TER
, O
work B-TER
, O
treatment O
– O
as O
long O
as O
we O
were O
prepared O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
should O
n’t O
be O
bothered O
by O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
electric O
fence O
. O

The O
very O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory O
. O

The O
food B-TER
really O
was O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
got O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
20 O
g O
of O
margarine B-TER
; O
midday O
we O
got O
¼ O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
from O
beets B-TER
and O
water O
, O
apart O
from O
Sundays O
when O
we O
had O
potato B-TER
soup I-TER
; O
and O
evenings O
again O
150 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
50 O
g O
of O
salami B-TER
. O

But O
the O
work B-TER
was O
for O
many O
people B-TER
strenuous O
. O

It O
was O
also O
very O
dirty O
work B-TER
, O
and O
on O
top O
of O
all O
that O
there O
was O
the O
harassment O
from O
the O
master O
( O
German B-TER
) O
, O
for O
whom O
we O
were O
just O
cattle O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
the O
very O
little O
sleep O
that O
we O
got O
at O
night O
and O
the O
long O
hours O
we O
worked B-TER
with O
only O
half O
an O
hour O
lunch O
break O
. O

A O
normal O
person O
who O
does O
n’t O
have O
the O
strength O
of O
horse O
ca O
n’t O
endure O
it O
. O

After O
we O
got O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
from O
work B-TER
, O
we O
were O
tormented O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
Capos B-TER
and O
block B-TER
seniors I-TER
until O
9PM O
. O

And O
so O
we O
lived O
from O
one O
day O
to O
the O
next O
, O
every O
second O
Sunday O
should O
be O
free O
from O
2PM O
. O

For O
us O
it O
looked O
like O
we O
had O
to O
carry O
stones O
from O
the O
outside O
the O
whole O
morning O
long O
. O

Even O
the O
people O
running O
the O
camp B-TER
did O
n’t O
know O
why O
. O

It O
was O
just O
harassment O
. O

Thank O
God O
that O
time O
passed O
and O
it O
was O
soon O
Christmas O
. O

Eight O
days O
before O
we O
were O
told O
that O
if O
we O
behave O
ourselves O
and O
there O
were O
no O
complaints O
from O
the O
factory O
about O
laziness O
amongst O
the O
prisoners B-TER
, O
then O
at O
Christmas O
we O
would O
get O
two O
full O
days O
off O
. O

We O
would O
also O
get O
better O
food B-TER
. O

Christmas O
came O
and O
we O
really O
did O
get O
the O
first O
day O
off O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
thick O
potato B-TER
soup I-TER
and O
cooked O
potatoes B-TER
. O

The O
second O
day O
did O
n’t O
go O
quite O
so O
peacefully O
. O

We O
were O
lying O
in O
bed O
as O
the O
camp B-TER
senior I-TER
came O
in O
and O
all O
hell O
broke O
loose O
. O

The O
place O
looked O
like O
a O
pigsty O
. O

Ten O
minutes O
later O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
was O
announced O
and O
as O
punishment O
, O
carrying O
stones O
was O
ordered O
. O

We O
carried O
stones O
until O
3PM O
and O
then O
we O
stood O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
until O
5PM O
, O
during O
which O
the O
dirtiest O
were O
sought O
out O
and O
punished O
with O
a O
beating O
. O

At O
5.30PM O
, O
we O
finally O
got O
our O
lunch B-TER
and O
then O
immediately O
afterwards O
our O
evening B-TER
meal I-TER
and O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
completely O
exhausted O
and O
battered O
. O

That O
’s O
what O
the O
two O
free O
days O
at O
Christmas O
looked O
like O
for O
us O
. O

But O
, O
we O
were O
already O
used O
to O
such O
things O
. O

What O
can O
you O
expect O
of O
such O
beastly O
creatures O
as O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
? O
It O
was O
almost O
New O
Year O
. O

The O
German B-TER
camp B-TER
management O
wanted O
again O
to O
appear O
human O
and O
let O
us O
have O
the O
day O
off O
. O

I O
think O
it O
probably O
better O
to O
say O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
the O
day O
off O
and O
to O
do O
that O
of O
course O
they O
had O
to O
give O
us O
the O
day O
off O
. O

The O
new O
year O
began O
. O

What O
troubles O
would O
it O
bring O
for O
us O
? O
Nobody O
knew O
. O

But O
look O
, O
it O
began O
well O
. O

Our O
camp B-TER
commandant O
Moll B-PER
, O
formerly O
the O
head O
of O
the O
annihilation B-TER
chambers I-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
was O
transferred O
to O
Buna B-LOC
- I-LOC
Monowitz I-LOC
, O
and O
we O
got O
a O
new O
one O
. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
promising O
. O

He O
held O
a O
speech O
in O
which O
– O
amongst O
other O
things O
– O
he O
pronounced O
that O
under O
him O
, O
there O
was O
no O
work B-TER
on O
Sundays O
, O
that O
the O
food B-TER
would O
be O
improved O
and O
that O
better O
care O
would O
be O
provided O
for O
the O
many O
people B-TER
who O
were O
ill B-TER
. O

We O
breathed O
a O
little O
easier O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
he O
was O
not O
like O
Moll B-PER
, O
and O
pretended O
at O
least O
that O
he O
had O
good O
intentions O
. O

How O
well O
he O
would O
deliver O
them O
, O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

And O
the O
next O
Sunday O
we O
really O
did O
get O
off O
. O

And O
once O
there O
was O
milk B-TER
. O

But O
none O
of O
it O
lasted O
very O
long O
. O

On O
the O
18th O
of O
January O
, O
the O
shift O
coming O
back O
from O
the O
factory O
told O
those O
of O
us O
who O
were O
ill B-TER
in O
bed O
, O
that O
the O
factory O
was O
being O
dismantled O
because O
of O
the O
advance O
of O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

This O
hit O
us O
like O
a O
bomb O
. O

And O
the O
question O
quickly O
arose O
of O
what O
would O
be O
done O
with O
us O
. O

There O
were O
three O
possibilities O
: O
1 O
shoot B-TER
us I-TER
, O
2 O
leave O
us O
to O
the O
Russians B-ORG
, O
3 O
evacuation B-TER
to O
the O
not O
yet O
occupied O
Germany B-TER
. O

There O
was O
much O
commotion O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Nobody O
new O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
next O
hours O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
at O
4PM O
, O
we O
were O
given O
our O
evening B-TER
meal I-TER
and O
sent O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
were O
expecting O
an O
unexpectedly O
quick O
decampment B-TER
. O

And O
then O
, O
at O
midnight O
we O
were O
woken O
up O
and O
told O
to O
get O
ready O
and O
at O
6AM O
we O
started O
out O
. O

Even O
the O
SS B-TER
guards I-TER
did O
n’t O
know O
where O
we O
were O
going O
. O

We O
had O
about O
1.5 O
kg O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
1/2 O
kg O
of O
margarine B-TER
that O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
our O
food B-TER
for O
three O
days O
. O

We O
started O
marching B-TER
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
have O
the O
slightest O
ideas O
how O
long O
we O
would O
be O
marching B-TER
for O
. O

After O
we O
had O
walked O
six O
hours O
through O
snow O
and O
ice O
without O
rest O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
we O
still O
had O
37 O
km O
to O
go O
until O
we O
would O
get O
our O
first O
break O
. O

We O
were O
all O
Muselmänner O
[ O
walking O
skeletons O
] O
and O
knew O
that O
even O
if O
any O
of O
us O
were O
even O
capable O
of O
doing O
it O
, O
we O
would O
have O
to O
march B-TER
into O
the O
night O
. O

Every O
so O
often O
, O
someone O
would O
collapse O
and O
then O
the O
SS B-TER
would O
shoot B-TER
them O
. O

And O
so O
we O
went O
, O
on O
and O
on O
to O
Germany B-TER
. O

And O
then O
suddenly O
, O
at O
about O
1AM O
, O
there O
appeared O
a O
camp O
before O
us O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
more O
than O
1000 O
men B-TER
were O
thrust O
into O
not O
very O
large O
barracks B-TER
. O

It O
was O
n’t O
possible O
to O
properly O
lie O
down O
, O
and O
barely O
possible O
to O
stand O
. O

People O
were O
sitting O
on O
each O
other O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
. O

In O
one O
camp B-TER
, O
( O
Jakobswalde B-LOC
) O
, O
we O
stayed O
until O
11AM O
the O
next O
day O
only O
to O
begin O
marching B-TER
again O
. O

We O
started O
marching B-TER
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

But O
we O
noticed O
that O
something O
was O
n’t O
right O
. O

Things O
were O
going O
badly O
behind O
the O
front O
. O

We O
marched B-TER
at O
a O
brisk O
pace O
and O
without O
a O
break O
for O
twelve O
hours O
and O
arrived O
at O
Blechhammer B-LOC
at O
11PM O
. O

We O
were O
met O
by O
Jewish O
Capos B-TER
and O
block B-TER
seniors I-TER
.They O
were O
very O
friendly O
to O
us O
and O
said O
that O
we O
would O
continue O
tomorrow O
. O

We O
slept O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
four O
days O
in O
beds B-TER
. O

At O
4AM O
we O
were O
drummed O
out O
of O
bed O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
and O
departure B-TER
. O

We O
however O
– O
a O
few O
hundred O
who O
were O
in O
one O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
at O
the O
back O
– O
had O
decided O
, O
that O
we O
would O
n’t O
go O
until O
the O
SS B-TER
came O
and O
collected O
us O
themselves O
. O

And O
we O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

700 O
men B-TER
had O
followed O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
were O
now O
leaving O
with O
them O
. O

Because O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
in O
a O
rush O
and O
you O
could O
already O
here O
the O
drone O
of O
the O
front O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
satisfied O
with O
the O
700 O
volunteers O
and O
left O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
to O
our O
punishment O
from O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

It O
was O
n’t O
a O
long O
period O
of O
peace O
. O

The O
next O
night O
, O
an O
SS B-TER
detachment I-TER
came O
and O
took O
a O
further O
400 O
men B-TER
who O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
gate O
out O
of O
curiosity O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
starving B-TER
which O
led O
to O
the O
savage O
killings B-TER
amongst O
themselves O
. O

The O
bread B-TER
and O
provision O
stores O
were O
attacked O
and O
anybody O
who O
left O
carrying O
bread O
was O
beaten O
and O
bludgeoned O
until O
unconscious O
or O
half O
dead O
by O
those O
standing O
outside O
. O

Death O
came O
when O
those O
who O
emerged O
afterwards O
stood O
on O
the O
those O
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
and O
defended O
what O
they O
had O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
an O
SS B-TER
annihilation I-TER
troop I-TER
had O
shown O
up O
and O
divided O
themselves O
amongst O
the O
watchtowers O
, O
using O
the O
people B-TER
running O
around O
blow O
as O
target O
practice O
. O

When O
they O
were O
finished O
and O
they O
were O
afraid O
as O
the O
front O
got O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
, O
they O
attempted O
to O
set O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
fire O
, O
which O
for O
all O
but O
two O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
they O
failed O
to O
do O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
made O
themselves O
scarce O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
a O
terrible O
sight O
. O

Every O
couple O
of O
meters O
there O
was O
a O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
, O
half O
burnt O
or O
bled O
- O
out O
and O
congealed O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

The O
bodies B-TER
caused O
a O
terrible O
smell O
of O
plague O
. O

We O
lived B-TER
like O
that O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
in O
the O
most O
awful O
fear O
that O
we O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
last O
minute O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

Even O
when O
there O
was O
no O
more O
SS B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
we O
were O
still O
in O
the O
German B-TER
area O
of O
the O
front O
, O
and O
Russians B-ORG
were O
n’t O
coming O
as O
quickly O
as O
we O
hoped O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
, O
a O
brave O
man O
who O
had O
ventured O
outside O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
met O
a O
Russian B-ORG
tank O
. O

The O
rejoicing O
was O
immense O
, O
because O
none O
of O
us O
had O
thought O
that O
we O
would O
ever O
get O
out O
of O
the O
clutches O
of O
the O
German B-TER
beasts O
. O
