Autobiography O
from O
the O
Time O
of O
the O
German B-TER
Occupation I-TER
When O
the O
war B-TER
broke O
out O
in O
1939 O
, O
I O
was O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Łódź B-LOC
( O
Poland B-LOC
) O
. O

In O
the O
ninth O
month O
[ O
September O
] O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

The O
day O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered B-TER
the O
city O
it O
became O
a O
hell O
. O

Immediately O
, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
decrees B-TER
were O
issued O
stating O
that O
the O
Jews O
must B-TER
not I-TER
walk I-TER
down O
the O
main O
streets O
and O
Jewish O
businesses O
must O
display B-TER
a I-TER
label I-TER
with O
a O
yellow B-TER
Star I-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
. O

Then O
they O
seized B-TER
[ O
people B-TER
] O
for O
labor B-TER
from O
every O
house O
and O
they O
gave O
Jews O
the O
hardest O
work O
. O

Then O
they O
again O
made O
a O
decree B-TER
that O
Jews O
must O
wear O
yellow B-TER
patches I-TER
; O
this O
allowed O
people B-TER
to O
identify O
who O
is O
a O
Jew O
and O
then O
they B-TER
beat I-TER
us I-TER
terribly O
on O
the O
streets O
so O
that O
indeed O
no O
one O
could O
go O
out O
in O
the O
street O
. O

Thus O
my O
family B-TER
decided O
to O
leave O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

After O
four O
months O
we O
all O
left O
Łódź B-LOC
, O
because O
they O
made O
a O
terrible O
ghetto B-TER
, O
for O
Połaniec B-LOC
( O
Kielce B-LOC
region O
, O
Poland B-LOC
) O
, O
my O
grandmother B-TER
lived O
there O
in O
the O
shtetl O
and O
we O
all O
lived O
with O
her O
. O

We O
began O
a O
new O
life O
there O
. O

It O
was O
better B-TER
for O
us O
than O
in O
Łódź B-LOC
. O

My O
father B-TER
began O
to O
trade O
and O
made O
a O
living O
. O

And O
so O
two O
years O
passed O
; O
not O
so O
calmly O
, O
there O
were O
various O
deportations B-TER
in O
a O
small O
format O
. O

SS B-ORG
men B-TER
fell O
upon O
the O
shtetl O
and O
constantly O
took O
a O
few O
people B-TER
. O

Once O
we O
heard O
in O
the O
shtetl O
the O
news O
that O
the O
entire O
shtetl O
was O
to O
be O
liquidated B-TER
. O

My O
father B-TER
and O
mother B-TER
decided O
to O
give O
me O
to O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman B-TER
and O
they O
would O
pay O
her O
. O

Once O
, O
in O
the O
ninth O
month O
of O
1942 O
, O
when O
my O
family B-TER
was O
hidden B-TER
in O
a O
bunker B-TER
made O
especially O
as O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
which O
my O
father B-TER
had O
built O
— O
I O
knew O
the O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
but O
I O
did O
not O
know O
how O
it O
looked O
— O
one O
morning O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
came O
to O
us O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
dressed B-TER
me O
nicely O
and O
did O
not O
give O
me O
any O
food B-TER
, O
only O
money O
, O
because O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
was O
to O
look O
after O
me O
in O
return O
for O
money O
. O

You O
can O
not O
imagine O
how O
the O
parting O
from O
my O
parents B-TER
was O
, O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
it O
my O
entire O
life O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
I O
can O
not O
write O
it O
down O
. O

With O
sadness O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
my O
parents B-TER
, O
but O
then O
something O
happened O
and O
, O
with O
God O
’s O
help O
, O
I O
met O
my O
family B-TER
again O
. O

I O
left O
home O
with O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
and O
we O
needed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
village O
there O
where O
this O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
lived O
. O

When O
we O
had O
already O
gone O
three O
kilometers O
and O
were O
in O
a O
forest O
, O
she O
said O
that O
she O
needed O
to O
take O
care O
of O
something O
and O
must O
go O
away O
for O
ten O
minutes O
. O

And O
so O
I O
waited O
for O
her O
and O
waited O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
she O
was O
not O
coming O
back O
and O
I O
understood O
that O
she O
had O
taken O
the O
money O
and O
would O
not O
return O
. O

She O
had B-TER
made I-TER
a I-TER
run I-TER
for O
it O
. O

It O
was O
already O
nighttime O
when O
I O
came O
out O
of O
the O
forest O
and O
found O
myself O
standing O
in O
a O
field O
where O
shepherds B-TER
were O
herding O
their O
animals O
and O
taking O
them O
home O
. O

They O
did O
not O
identify O
me O
as O
a O
Jew O
when O
I O
went O
up O
to O
them O
, O
and O
I O
asked O
them O
where O
is O
the O
way O
to O
Połaniec B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
showed O
me O
the O
right O
way O
. O

Then O
I O
found O
the O
bunker B-TER
where O
my O
parents B-TER
and O
family B-TER
were O
hiding B-TER
. O

I O
called O
out O
, O
Mother O
, O
because O
I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
the O
entrance O
was O
to O
get O
inside O
the O
bunker B-TER
. O

They O
were O
very O
shocked O
to O
see O
me O
and O
I O
too O
was O
surprised O
seeing O
the O
bunker B-TER
where O
we O
would O
have O
to O
live O
for O
we O
did O
not O
know O
how O
long O
. O

This O
was O
in O
a O
stable B-TER
, O
under O
the O
hay O
and O
under O
the O
earth O
. O

It O
was O
a O
pit O
lined O
with O
boards O
: O
its O
height O
maybe O
be O
one O
meter O
and O
its O
breadth O
three O
meters O
. O

On O
the O
floor O
was O
spread O
out O
bedding O
and O
we O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
bedding O
because O
it O
was O
impossible B-TER
to I-TER
stand I-TER
up I-TER
. O

The O
owner O
of O
the O
stable O
took O
payment O
of O
4500 O
zlotys O
per O
month O
. O

At O
night O
my O
father B-TER
went O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
to O
bring O
the O
water B-TER
and O
food B-TER
which O
the O
farmer B-TER
prepared O
in O
advance O
, O
and O
so O
it O
was O
from O
the O
beginning O
of O
our O
life O
in O
the O
bunker B-TER
. O

However O
, O
after O
a O
while O
the O
farmer B-TER
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
risk O
buying O
food B-TER
for O
us O
anymore O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
onwards O
began O
for O
us O
the O
worst O
and O
bitterest B-TER
time I-TER
of O
life O
and O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
my O
father B-TER
was O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
supply O
of O
food B-TER
ran O
out O
and O
we O
were O
left O
without O
hope O
. O

My O
father B-TER
went O
out O
every O
night O
to O
get O
food B-TER
. O

However O
, O
he O
now O
did O
not O
bring O
bread B-TER
but O
only O
raw O
potatoes B-TER
, O
cabbage B-TER
leaves O
, O
onions B-TER
, O
and O
so O
we O
lived O
from O
this O
the O
entire O
year O
of O
1943 O
and O
the O
first O
half O
of O
1944 O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
suffered O
very O
much O
with O
her O
stomach O
and O
it O
pained O
her O
very O
much O
and O
she O
was O
very O
sick B-TER
. O

My O
little O
brother B-TER
somehow O
hung O
on O
, O
as O
did O
I. O
My O
father B-TER
said O
nothing O
but O
it O
was O
clear O
from O
Father B-TER
’s O
face O
that O
he O
suffered O
very O
much O
from O
hunger B-TER
and O
also O
morally O
: O
it O
pained O
him O
greatly O
that O
he O
could O
not O
help O
us O
and O
he O
did O
his O
best O
to O
help O
us O
. O

The O
hunger B-TER
and O
cold B-TER
made O
us O
very O
dispirited O
and O
we O
saw O
no O
end O
to O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
on O
June O
25 O
, O
1944 O
, O
my O
father B-TER
went O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
at O
night O
thinking O
that O
he O
would O
go O
to O
another O
village O
five O
kilometers O
way O
and O
there O
he O
would O
buy O
bread B-TER
, O
because O
my O
mother B-TER
could O
no O
longer O
eat O
the O
cabbage B-TER
leaves O
. O

He O
went O
and O
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

I O
cried O
the O
whole O
night O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
began O
to O
feel O
much O
worse O
and O
we O
had O
no O
news O
about O
my O
father B-TER
. O

So O
I O
said O
to O
my O
little O
brother B-TER
that O
he O
should O
go O
and O
find O
out O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
father B-TER
. O

My O
brother B-TER
went O
out O
and O
came O
back O
and O
told O
us O
he O
heard O
that O
our O
father B-TER
had O
been O
caught O
by O
the O
farmers B-TER
; O
what O
they O
did O
with O
him O
I O
do O
not O
know O
to O
this O
day O
. O

We O
cried O
day O
and O
night O
but O
father B-TER
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

However O
, O
our O
luck O
had O
already O
evaporated O
, O
as O
bread O
always O
falls O
on O
the O
buttered O
side O
. O

After O
two O
months O
the O
farmer B-TER
who O
owned O
the O
bunker B-TER
came O
to O
us O
and O
spoke O
to O
us O
in O
this O
way O
: O
The O
Russians O
have O
torn O
through O
the O
front O
and O
the O
Germans O
are O
fleeing O
and O
searching O
all O
homes O
and O
fields O
. O

Therefore O
I O
am O
afraid O
to O
hide O
you O
anymore O
. O

And O
he O
told O
us O
that O
we O
should O
give O
him O
money O
and O
he O
would O
take O
us O
into O
a O
deep O
forest O
where O
we O
could O
hide B-TER
ourselves O
and O
he O
would O
help O
us O
. O

And O
we O
listened O
to O
him O
and O
we O
had O
no O
other O
counsel O
. O

So O
the O
next O
day O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
it O
was O
still O
very O
dark O
, O
he O
rode O
up O
to O
the O
bunker B-TER
in O
a O
wagon O
and O
we O
came O
out O
from O
the O
hidden B-TER
bunker I-TER
. O

Going O
out O
from O
the O
bunker B-TER
we O
could O
not O
stand O
on O
our O
feet O
and O
all O
three O
of O
us O
went O
onto O
the O
wagon O
. O

Together O
with O
my O
brother B-TER
I O
carried O
my O
mother B-TER
to O
the O
wagon O
, O
because O
she O
was O
very O
weak O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
off O
. O

After O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
travelling O
we O
reached O
some O
water O
. O

The O
wagon O
stopped O
and O
he O
told O
us O
to O
get O
off O
the O
wagon O
. O

By O
the O
water O
stood O
the O
farmer B-TER
’s I-TER
brother I-TER
. O

And O
then O
began O
a O
terrible O
scene O
which O
I O
will O
never O
in O
my O
life O
forget O
. O

He O
quickly O
pulled O
her O
[ O
my O
mother B-TER
] O
down O
murderously O
and O
threw O
her O
into O
the O
water O
, O
and O
he O
beat O
me O
severely O
, O
and O
then O
my O
little O
brother B-TER
. O

But O
in O
the O
blink O
of O
an O
eye O
I O
tore O
myself O
from O
his O
hands O
and O
sprang O
into O
the O
water O
. O

I O
began O
walking O
in O
the O
water O
to O
the O
other O
side O
. O

It O
became O
dark O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
strength O
to O
go O
on O
. O

With O
my O
last O
strength O
I O
barely O
managed O
to O
run O
across O
. O

I O
went O
on O
without O
stopping O
for O
5–6 O
kilometers O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
other O
village O
. O

There O
I O
went O
up O
to O
the O
first O
, O
best O
farmer B-TER
, O
banged O
on O
the O
door O
and O
went O
in O
and O
begged O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
that O
was O
there O
inside O
, O
telling O
her O
that O
I O
was O
from O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
and O
when O
the O
Russians B-TER
invaded O
I O
fled O
. O

I O
asked O
that O
she O
should O
take O
me O
in O
to O
tend O
to O
the O
livestock O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
had O
mercy O
on O
me O
and O
she O
took O
me O
in O
and O
I O
worked B-TER
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
it O
was O
good O
for O
me O
. O

The O
woman B-TER
treated O
me O
well O
, O
like O
her O
own O
child B-TER
. O

But O
one O
day O
the O
same O
farmer B-TER
who O
killed B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
and O
little O
brother B-TER
, O
he O
must O
have O
found O
out O
that O
I O
was O
there O
, O
and O
he O
told O
the O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
that O
I O
was O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
and O
communist B-TER
and O
she O
must O
not O
keep O
me O
. O

When O
he O
said O
this O
to O
her O
in O
one O
room O
, O
I O
heard O
it O
all O
from O
another O
room O
. O

Hearing O
this O
, O
I O
was O
very O
frightened O
that O
she O
would O
hand O
me O
in O
and O
I O
fled O
through O
the O
other O
door O
. O

I O
fled O
without O
even O
stopping O
to O
breathe O
, O
until O
I O
came O
to O
another O
village O
. O

And O
there O
I O
went O
to O
a O
farmer B-TER
woman I-TER
. O

I O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
and O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

But O
I O
was O
not O
there O
for O
long O
and O
finally O
the O
Russians B-TER
came O
to O
the O
village O
and O
I O
was O
liberated B-TER
. O

But O
sadly O
alone O
. O

The O
day O
of O
happiness O
was O
August O
2 O
, O
1944 O
. O

After O
spending O
a O
few O
weeks O
in O
the O
village O
I O
saw O
how O
the O
Poles B-TER
were O
killing B-TER
Jews I-TER
after O
the O
liberation B-TER
. O

I O
travelled O
to O
