Report O
The O
following O
declarations O
were O
made O
by O
a O
Jewish B-TER
refugee I-TER
who O
had O
recently O
arrived O
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
. O

The O
refugee B-TER
was O
arrested B-TER
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Brussels B-LOC
during O
a O
round B-TER
- I-TER
up I-TER
of O
Jews O

at I-LOC
Malines I-LOC

Mechelen O
where O
he O
was O
kept O
for O
three O
days O
with O
thousands O
of O
Jewish O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

Some O
of O
them O
had O
received O
an O
order B-TER
to O
report O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
equipped O
with O
belongings O
and O
enough O
rations B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

The O
others O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
like O
him O
in O
the O
street O
, O
with O
no O
advance O
warning O
. O

At O
the O
camp B-LOC
the O
children B-TER
under O
fourteen O
were O
separated O
from O
the O
adults O
, O
the O
men B-TER
over O
sixty O
were O
sent O
home B-TER
. O

He O
does O
not O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

After O
three O
days O
at O
the O
camp B-LOC
he O
was O
designated O
for O
deportation B-TER
with O
many O
of O
the O
men B-TER
, O
most O
of O
them O
young O
. O

All O
they O
had O
with O
them O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

Those O
who O
had O
received O
official O
summonses O
and O
consequently O
had O
luggage O
with O
them O
had O
to O
leave O
it O
behind O
. O

They O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
keep O
the O
food B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
in O
the O
street O
and O
had O
nothing O
with O
them O
were O
given O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

At O
the O
station O
, O
before O
they O
boarded O
the O
train B-TER
, O
there O
was O
a O
second O
inspection O
. O

Each O
person O
had O
to O
put O
into O
a O
basket O
any O
valuables O
he O
had O
on O
him O
: O
rings O
, O
watches O
, O
etc O
. O

From O
some O
of O
them O
the O
German B-LOC
inspectors O
took O
clothes B-TER
they O
took O
a O
liking O
to O
, O
handing O
over O
in O
exchange O
second O
- O
hand O
shoes B-TER
or O
clothes B-TER
. O

After O
this O
last O
inspection O
they O
were O
herded O
into O
a O
dozen O
cattle B-TER
wagons I-TER
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
was O
shoved O
into O
a O
wagon B-TER
with O
seventy O
other O
men B-TER
. O

They O
were O
squeezed O
in O
like O
sardines O
in O
a O
tin O
. O

Impossible O
to O
sit O
or O
to O
move O
; O
they O
had O
to O
stay O
this O
way O
for O
two O
and O
a O
half O
days O
. O

No O
chance O
of O
answering O
calls O
of O
nature O
. O

After O
two O
and O
a O
half O
days O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
at O
Königshütte B-LOC
in O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
and O
the O
train B-TER
was O
cleared O
. O

Several O
of O
the O
weaker O
deportees B-TER
had O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
our O
informer O
saw O
seven O
of O
these O
carried O
off O
. O

At O
the O
station O
they O
were O
given O
hot O
soup B-TER
from O
large O
tureens O
marked O
with O
red B-ORG
crosses I-ORG
. O

It O
was O
probably O
a O
distribution O
organised O
by O
the O
German B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

Then O
the O
fourteen- O
to O
twenty O
- O
year O
- O
olds O
, O
who O
made O
up O
about O
half O
the O
convoy O
, O
were O
taken O
away O
. O

It O
seems O
they O
were O
to O
work O
in O
heavy O
industry B-TER
and O
in O
the O
mines B-TER
of O
Königshütte B-LOC
and O
its O
surrounding O
area O
. O

Other O
deportees B-TER
got O
back O
into O
the O
wagons B-TER
where O
this O
time O
there O
was O
a O
bit O
more O
space O
and O
the O
train B-TER
set O
off O
towards O
the O
east O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
recognised O
Lvov B-LOC
( O
Lemberg B-LOC
) O
, O
then O
Rava B-LOC
- I-LOC
Russka I-LOC
and O
a O
region O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
too O
exhausted O
to O
notice O
how O
long O
the O
journey O
lasted O
. O

The O
train B-TER
stopped O
in O
Russia B-LOC
. O

The O
deportees B-TER
were O
gathered O
together O
at O
the O
station O
. O

Each O
one O
was O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
fit O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Half O
of O
them O
, O
about O
150 O
men B-TER
mostly O
aged O
between O
twenty O
and O
thirty O
- O
five O
, O
said O
they O
were O
. O

The O
others O
said O
they O
were O
not O
and O
were O
taken O
away O
, O
whilst O
the O
first O
group O
got O
back O
on O
the O
train B-TER
and O
continued O
the O
journey O
for O
half O
a O
day O
more O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
does O
not O
know O
exactly O
in O
which O
region O
they O
arrived O
. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
distant O
region O
, O
deep O
inside O
Russia B-LOC
– O
he O
noticed O
a O
signpost O
indicating O
Stalingrad O
50 O
km O
, O
and O
whilst O
he O
was O
in O
this O
region O
he O
heard O
the O
noise O
of O
bombing B-TER
and O
gunfire B-TER
two O
or O
three O
times O
, O
suggesting O
they O
were O
close O
to O
the O
battle B-TER
field I-TER
. O

As O
soon O
as O
they O
arrived O
the O
men B-TER
were O
taken O
in O
groups O
to O
huts B-TER
and O
were O
given O
work B-TER
clothes I-TER
. O

These O
were O
khaki O
uniforms B-TER

worn O
by O
the O

Fritz O

an O

It O
was O

. O

( O

but O
without O
the O
armbands O
with O
the O

Our O
informer O
was O
put O
into O
a O
group O
of O
sixty O
men B-TER
. O

Other O
teams O
worked O
in O
the O
same O
area O
as O
his O
, O
and O
he O
noticed O
nearby O
a O
group O
of O
French B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
, O
as O
he O
realised O
when O
he O
heard O
them O
speaking O
their O
language O
. O

A O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
confirmed O
to O
him O
later O
that O
this O
observation O
was O
correct O
. O

The O
huts B-TER
reserved O
for O
the O
deportees B-TER
were O
the O
same O
as O
the O
German B-ORG
army I-ORG
uses O
for O
its O
men B-TER
. O

There O
were O
bunk O
beds O
, O
in O
threes O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
. O

They O
were O
probably O
constructing O
fortifications O
for O
the O
eastern O
front O
. O

The O
men B-TER
had O
to O
carry O
over O
a O
long O
distance O
heavy O
sacks O
of O
cement O
weighing O
more O
than O
fifty O
kilos O
. O

There O
were O
also O
large O
iron O
grids O
from O
which O
they O
made O
sort O
of O
anti O
- O
tank O
barriers O
. O

They O
were O
forced O
to O
work B-TER
for O
ten O
hours O
each O
day O
and O
since O
they O
had O
to O
walk O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
and O
from O
the O
huts B-TER
to O
the O
work B-TER
site I-TER
, O
the O
working B-TER
day I-TER
was O
in O
reality O
twelve O
hours O
, O
from O
six O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
six O
at O
night O
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
were O
completely O
exhausted O
. O

Supervisors O
constantly O
harried O
the O
men B-TER
, O
as O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
square O
metres O
had O
to O
be O
completed O
daily O
. O

Talking O
was O
not O
allowed O
during O
working B-TER
hours I-TER
. O

They O
worked B-TER
on O
Sundays O
the O
same O
as O
on O
weekdays O
, O
apparently O
not O
being O
allowed O
to O
rest O
until O
the O
fifth O
Sunday O
. O

As O
for O
food B-TER
, O
the O
men O
received O
a O
900 O
- O
gram O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
that O
is O
225 O
grams O
per O
man B-TER
, O
each O
day O
. O

At O
midday O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
hot O
soup B-TER
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
a O
blackish O
liquid O
called O
coffee B-TER
, O
with O
a O
little O
saccharine B-TER
. O

In O
the O
evenings O
they O
all O
fell O
asleep O
, O
exhausted O
. O

All O
conversation O
was O
forbidden O
. O

Writing B-TER
was O
not O
possible O
. O

For O
a O
week O
our O
informer O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
like O
all O
the O
others O
. O

Then O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
drivers O
had O
disappeared O
, O
one O
of O
the O
supervising O
officers B-TER
asked O
if O
anyone O
knew O
how O
to O
drive O
. O

As O
he O
had O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
Ford B-PER
factories B-TER
in O
Brussels B-LOC
our O
refugee B-TER
was O
chosen O
and O
from O
then O
on O
drove O
this O
officer B-TER
’s I-TER
car O
, O
accompanying O
him O
on O
all O
his O
tours O
of O
duty O
. O

They O
came O
to O
like O
each O
other O
and O
the O
officer B-TER
was O
quite O
open O
with O
him O
. O

He O
was O
a O
young O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
of O
about O
twenty O
- O
five O
. O

He O
was O
originally O
from O
Bavaria B-LOC
, O
and O
had O
already O
earned O
three O
stars O
; O
he O
had O
lost O
two O
brothers O
in O
the O
war B-TER
and O
had O
left O
behind O
a O
young O
wife B-TER
and O
small O
child B-TER
. O

He O
said O
he O
was O
totally O
disgusted O
by O
the O
war B-TER
and O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

It O
was O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
war B-TER
was O
already O
lost O
, O
and O
he O
hated O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
had O
been O
done O
, O
and O
was O
still O
being O
done O
, O
to O
the O
Jews O
. O

The O
information O
that O
follows O
came O
to O
our O
refugee B-TER
from O
this O
officer B-TER
. O

Having O
asked O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
the O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
had O
arrived O
with O
his O
group O
and O
who O
had O
been O
found O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
, O
he O
was O
told O
by O
the O
officer B-TER
that O
they O
all O
been O
executed B-TER
; O
the O
officer B-TER
added O
that O
this O
was O
the O
fate O
of O
all O
those O
who O
, O
through O
exhaustion O
, O
could O
no O
longer O
work B-TER
. O

The O
officer B-TER
was O
unhappy O
with O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
but O
could O
do O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
it O
. O

Our O
refugee B-TER
begged O
him O
not O
to O
keep O
harassing O
the O
Jews O
at O
work B-TER
, O
but O
the O
officer B-TER
explained O
that O
he O
had O
to O
do O
it O
, O
because O
he O
was O
obliged O
ensure O
that O
a O
certain O
quantity O
of O
work B-TER
was O
completed O
each O
day O
. O

The O
means O
of O
exterminating B-TER
the O
Jews O
who O
were O
incapable O
of O
work B-TER
, O
said O
the O
officer B-TER
, O
was O
to O
line O
them O
up O
against O
a O
wall O
and O
shoot B-TER
them O
, O
or O
if O
this O
was O
not O
possible O
, O
by O
poisoning B-TER
their O
food B-TER
. O

Our O
man B-TER
spent O
two O
weeks O
with O
this O
officer B-TER
, O
who O
behaved O
like O
a O
gentleman O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
this O
time O
, O
the O
officer B-TER
told O
him O
that O
a O
very O
rare O
chance O
of O
escape B-TER
was O
available O
to O
him O
. O

Every O
two O
or O
three O
months O
a O
train B-TER
left O
for O
the O
west O
and O
the O
following O
day O
was O
the O
very O
day O
of O
its O
departure O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
insisted O
he O
should O
seize O
this O
chance O
, O
which O
would O
not O
recur O
. O

He O
himself O
hid O
him O
in O
a O
goods O
wagon B-TER
full O
of O
parcels B-TER
and O
sacks O
, O
he O
gave O
him O
plenty O
of O
provisions O
( O
bread B-TER
, O
conserves B-TER
etc O
) O
for O
the O
journey O
and O
two O
Reichsmarks O
( O
the O
currency O
of O
the O
occupation O
) O
. O

He O
told O
him O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
his O
uniform B-TER
, O
that O
these O
uniforms B-TER
were O
worn O
in O
all O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER
. O

After O
checking O
that O
the O
wagon B-TER
was O
properly O
sealed O
the O
officer B-TER
notified O
one O
of O
the O
train B-TER
employees O
of O
our O
traveller O
’s O
presence O
and O
it O
was O
thus O
that O
he O
made O
for O
the O
west O
, O
hidden B-TER
beneath O
a O
pile O
of O
sacks O
. O

Being O
in O
the O
dark O
he O
could O
not O
distinguish O
night O
from O
day O
, O
he O
could O
just O
see O
a O
little O
light O
through O
the O
gaps O
in O
the O
wagon B-TER
, O
so O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
how O
long O
the O
journey O
took O
. O

Amongst O
the O
sacks O
in O
the O
wagon B-TER
he O
noticed O
some O
that O
contained O
black O
[ O
probably O
SS B-ORG
] O
uniforms B-TER
. O

He O
stayed O
like O
this O
until O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
. O

When O
the O
man B-TER
who O
had O
been O
informed O
of O
his O
presence O
opened O
the O
wagon B-TER
he O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
in O
the O
goods O
yard O
of O
the O
Gare O
de O
l’Est O
in O
Paris O
. O

He O
was O
shown O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
station O
and O
he O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
home B-TER
of O
one O
of O
his O
brothers O
- O
in O
- O
law O
who O
lived O
in O
Paris B-LOC
. O

Having O
got O
some O
money O
and O
changed O
his O
clothes B-TER
, O
he O
left O
the O
city O
that O
evening O
and O
went O
to O
the O
free O
[ O
unoccupied O
] O
zone O
, O
from O
where O
he O
left O
for O
Switzerland B-LOC
, O
along O
with O
some O
other O
refugees B-TER
. O

His O
adventure O
had O
lasted O
six O
weeks O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
this O
man B-TER
in O
a O
Swiss B-LOC
hospital B-TER
. O

He O
was O
thirty O
- O
three O
years O
old O
, O
of O
robust O
appearance O
, O
the O
type O
who O
works B-TER
with O
machines O
, O
of O
nondescript O
appearance O
and O
average O
intelligence O
. O

He O
scarcely O
realises O
his O
extraordinary O
luck O
. O

He O
made O
a O
good O
impression O
on O
me O
, O
recounting O
quite O
simply O
the O
things O
he O
had O
seen O
, O
adding O
nothing O
that O
he O
had O
not O
seen O
personally O
. O

He O
often O
replied O
to O
my O
questions O
with O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

His O
accounts O
of O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
in O
Belgium B-LOC
also O
accord O
with O
those O
of O
others O
who O
have O
arrived O
here O
. O

We O
should O
note O
, O
too O
, O
that O
he O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
his O
extraordinary O
odyssey O
to O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
authorities O
when O
they O
questioned O
him O
. O

He O
made O
no O
attempt O
whatsoever O
to O
make O
himself O
interesting O
to O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
authorities O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
he O
might O
perhaps O
obtain O
some O
special O
treatment O
. O

Besides O
all O
they O
asked O
was O
where O
he O
came O
from O
. O

He O
answered O
from O
Lyon O
. O

No O
other O
question O
having O
been O
asked O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
story O
to O
himself O
. O
