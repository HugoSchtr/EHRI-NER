The O
establishment O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
ghetto B-TER
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
has O
not O
been O
unexpected O
as O
reports O
of O
some O
such O
impending O
action O
have O
been O
current O
in O
that O
city O
, O
particularly O
among O
Jewish B-TER
circles I-TER
, O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
the O
occupation B-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
active O
preparations O
, O
which O
could O
be O
interpreted O
in O
no O
other O
way O
than O
as O
tending O
towards O
a O
complete O
segregation B-TER
of O
the O

A O
strange O
commentary O
on O
life O
in O
German B-TER
- I-TER
occupied I-TER
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
presented O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
a O
nationalist B-TER
Pole B-TER
has O
endeavored O
to O
take O
on O
the O
‘ O
protective O
coloration O
’ O
of O
the O
Jew B-TER
in O
order O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
German B-ORG
police I-ORG
or O
to O
avoid O
compulsory B-TER
labor I-TER
. O

These O
‘ O
refugees B-TER
’ O
have O
adopted O
Jewish B-TER
insignia B-TER
and O
taken O
up O
residence O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
; O
many O
stories O
are O
current O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
of O
Jews B-TER
tearing O
off O
their O
racial B-TER
badges I-TER
and O
passing O
them O
over O
in O
the O
streets O
to O
fleeing O
Poles B-TER
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
during O
the O
period O
of O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
disturbances O
in O
Poland B-LOC
prior O
to O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
the O
600,000 O
people O
in O
the O
Jewish O
district O
, O
almost O
evenly O
divided O
between O
Poles B-TER
and O
Jews B-TER
, O
managed O
to O
get O
along O
together O
peacefully O
and O
lived O
in O
a O
community O
spirit O
which O
was O
not O
noticeable O
in O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
pending O
segregation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
an O
official O
ghetto B-TER
affects O
an O
equal O
number O
of O
Poles B-TER
and O
the O
move O
may O
in O
the O
long O
run O
bring O
greater O
discomfort O
to O
the O
latter O
than O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
. O

At O
any O
rate O
the O
Jews B-TER
may O
well O
be O
in O
a O
better O
position O
to O
maintain O
a O
united O
front O
towards O
the O
occupying B-TER
authorities I-TER
and O
to O
find O
in O
community O
life O
a O
solace O
and O
protection O
until O
the O
time O
comes O
when O
a O
life O
of O
freedom O
and O
tolerance O
can O
at O
last O
be O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
unhappy O
thousands O
now O
to O
be O
concentrated B-TER
in O
the O
greatest O
of O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC

Jewries B-TER
