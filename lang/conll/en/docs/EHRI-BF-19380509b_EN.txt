Dear O
Sirs O
, O
I O
am O
here O
in O
England B-LOC
as O
the O
authorised O
representative O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Deputies O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Burgenland B-LOC
and O
the O
Orthodox O
Rabbis B-TER
of O
Austria B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
for O
10 O
days O
already O
, O
but O
have O
unfortunately O
accomplished O
very O
little O
. O

In O
the O
name O
of O
many O
thousands O
of O
suffering O
people O
, O
I O
beg O
of O
you O
most O
urgently O
and O
desperately O
to O
support O
the O
case O
of O
the O
privately O
instituted O
Aid B-ORG
Committee I-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Orthodox I-ORG
Jewry I-ORG
in I-ORG
Vienna I-ORG
and O
especially O
the O
desperate O
need O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Burgenland B-LOC
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
we O
have O
to O
face O
the O
tragic O
problem O
of O
The O
Burgenland B-LOC
Refugees B-TER
, O
the O
full O
burden O
of O
which O
falls O
upon O
the O
Committee B-ORG
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
of O
the O
Burgenland B-LOC
, O
mostly O
families B-TER
settled O
there O
since O
centuries O
and O
distinguished O
by O
their O
conservative O
conduct O
, O
numbering O
about O
3,000 O
, O
were O
- O
as O
is O
sufficiently O
known O
- O
by O
means O
of O
tortures O
unheard O
of O
, O
compelled O
to O
charge O
themselves O
in O
a O
written O
statement O
with O
the O
commitment O
of O
different O
crimes O
. O

On O
the O
ground O
of O
these O
extorted O
protocols O
, O
their O
property B-TER
was I-TER
confiscated I-TER
and O
they O
themselves O
driven O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

One O
part O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
was O
deprived O
of O
all O
means O
, O
and O
driven O
to O
different O
frontiers O
- O
Czecho B-LOC
- I-LOC
Slovakia I-LOC
, O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Jugo B-LOC
- I-LOC
Slavia I-LOC
[ O

] O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
hunted O
in O
herds O
, O
the O
oldest O
victim O
was O
83 O
years O
, O
the O
youngest B-TER
3 O
weeks O
old O
. O

Among O
them O
were O
families B-TER
who O
once O
possessed O
more O
than O
£ O
100.000 O
, O
and O
have O
to O
- O
day O
not O
a O
single O
penny O
left O
. O

In O
Czecho B-LOC
- I-LOC
Slovakia I-LOC
alone O
, O
there O
are O
more O
than O
fifty O
of O
these O
people O
driven O
out O
and O
now O
hidden O
in O
different O
families B-TER
, O
as O
they O
are O
there O
illegally O
without O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Authorities O
. O

Should O
the O
Authorities O
be O
informed O
of O
this O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
they O
will O
be O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
frontier O
and O
the O
tragedy O
of O
persecution B-TER
will O
start O
again O
. O

Another O
part O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
are O
on O
the O
well O
- O
known O
French B-LOC
steamer O
in O
the O
Danube B-LOC
at O
Rajka B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
English B-PER
and O
American B-PER
Consul B-TER
in O
Prague B-LOC
have O
undertaken O
a O
guarantee O
for O
emigration B-TER
on O
behalf O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
. O

One O
part O
of O
these O
exiled B-TER
are O
still O
in O
the O
Burgenland B-LOC
. O

Their O
businesses O
have O
been O
confiscated B-TER
ant O
they O
will O
have O
to O
go O
at O
short O
notice O
. O

The O
longest O
term O
, O
which O
has O
been O
fixed O
for O
exile B-TER
, O
is O
the O
25th O

The O
