Record O
taken O
by O
Bauminger B-PER
. O

In O
1939 O
we O
left O
Wilno B-LOC
and O
headed O
for O
Lvov B-LOC
. O

My O
parents O
wanted O
to O
take O
me O
to O
Drohobycz B-LOC
and O
then O
to O
return O
to O
Lvov B-LOC
. O

When O
we O
reached O
Drohobycz B-LOC
, O
my O
parents O
found O
work O
there O
and O
we O
all O
stayed O
there O
. O

I O
went O
to O
school O
right O
away O
. O

I O
kept O
my O
best O
memories O
from O
this O
school O
. O

On O
June O
22 O
, O
1941 O
the O
Russo O
- O
German O
war B-TER
broke O
out O
. O

The O
day O
before O
I O
had O
received O
my O
school O
certificate O
, O
I O
had O
been O
on O
a O
school O
excursion O
, O
and O
nobody O
had O
been O
thinking O
about O
the O
war B-TER
. O

In O
the O
morning O
terrible O
noises O
woke O
us O
up O
. O

We O
thought O
these O
were O
just O
military O
drills O
but O
then O
the O
radio O
and O
newspapers O
put O
us O
right O
. O

The O
evacuation O
of O
Drohobycz B-LOC
began O
. O

The O
army B-TER
left O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
unclear O
. O

The O
worst O
was O
when O
the O
Bolsheviks O
left O
the O
town O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
still O
were O
n’t O
there O
. O

Ukrainians B-TER
went O
mad O
then O
. O

Pogroms B-TER
began O
. O

Ukrainians B-TER
would O
go O
from O
house O
to O
house O
with O
truncheons O
, O
axes O
, O
stanchions O
, O
and O
beat B-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

One O
man O
wanted O
to O
save O
us O
but O
his O
wife B-TER
did O
not O
let O
him O
save O
the O
Jews O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
even O
hear O
the O
Germans B-TER
enter O
. O

Their O
first O
orders B-TER
. O

Jews O
are O
allowed O
to O
buy O
things O
on O
the O
market O
square O
only O
within O
specified B-TER
hours I-TER
. O

Armbands B-TER
were O
introduced O
, O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
was O
organized O
. O

They O
robbed O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
gave O
away O
for O
the O
contingents B-TER
the O
poorest O
ones O
who O
could O
n’t O
ransom O
themselves O
. O

One O
particular O
situation O
remained O
etched O
in O
my O
memory O
. O

Nearby O
, O
there O
was O
a O
very O
rich O
German B-TER
delicatessen O
. O

The O
owner O
’s O
daughter O
, O
very O
pretty O
, O
the O
picture O
of O
health O
, O
slapped O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
on O
the O
face O
, O
dressed O
in O
rags O
, O
who O
had O
asked O
for O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER

From O
time O
to O
time O
, O
Job O

news O
of O
the O
coming O
action O
. O

We O
would O
go O
into O
hiding B-TER
. O

In O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
attic O
there O
was O
a O
hole O
through O
which O
we O
crawled O
into O
our O
hideout B-TER
. O

It O
was O
so O
low O
we O
had O
to O
lie O
flat O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

We O
got O
work O
in O
the O
roofing O

Brygidki O
– O
prison O
in O

It O
was O
a O
sealed O
camp B-TER
for O
girls B-TER
, O
they O
lived O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
behind O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
roof O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
was O
leaking O
. O

They O
worked O
hard O
thinking O
it O
would O
save O
them O
from O
deportation B-TER
. O

At O
first O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
go O
out O
into O
town O
from O
there O
with O
a O
pass O
. O

During O
the O
actions O
in O
Drohobycz B-LOC
there O
was O
a O
terrible O
panic O
in O
the O
roofing O
- O
tile O
factory B-TER
as O
well O
. O

We O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
summer B-TER
- I-TER
house I-TER
near O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
did O
n’t O
think O
that O
somebody O
might O
have O
hidden B-TER
in O
the O
summer B-TER
- I-TER
house I-TER
which O
was O
just O
by O
the O
factory B-TER
gate O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
we O
managed O
to O
avoid O
death B-TER
. O

They O
put O
all O
the O
girls B-TER
onto O
the O
trucks O
then O
. O

As O
one O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
’s O
managers O
, O
Daddy O
defended O
them O
, O
then O
one O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
took O
out O
a O
pistol O
and O
wanted O
to O
shoot O
Daddy O
. O

At O
this O
moment O
one O
Polish B-TER
woman B-TER
, O
looking O
at O
all O
this O
from O
the O
upper O
floor O
, O
gave O
a O
terrible O
scream O
. O

This O
must O
have O
disconcerted O
the O
German B-TER
for O
he O
hid O
the O
pistol O
. O

Very O
many O
girls B-TER
were O
taken O
that O
time O
to O

With O

high O
they O
sang O
