From O
October O
1938 O
until O
October O
1941 O
we O
lived O
in O
Prague B-LOC

That O
month O
, O
Jews O
were O
required O
to O
register B-TER

the O
first O

Our O

It O
happened O
like O
this O

Our O

was O
labelled O
with O
our O

After O
all O
of O

1941 O

We O
marched O
past O
SS B-TER
Grupenführer O
Fidler O
, O
who O
took O
away O
all O
of O
our O
musical B-TER
instruments O
and O
any O
luggage O
that O
looked O
fancy O
. O

At O
6 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
we O
boarded O
a O
passenger O
train O
that O
departed O
from O
the O
Bubeneč B-LOC
train O
station O
at O
1 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

It O
traveled O
along O
a O
strange O
route O
through O
Dresden B-LOC
, O
Görlitz B-LOC
, O
Liegnitz B-LOC
, O
Vratislav B-LOC
, O
Lodz B-LOC
. O

Schupo B-ORG
accompanied O
us O
on O
this O
journey O
. O

The O
train O
ride O
lasted O
32 O
hours O
, O
and O
we O
were O
given O
water O
only O
once O
. O

We O
got O
out O
on O
some O
sort O
of O
provisional O
platform O
. O

We O
later O
learned O
that O
this O
was O
Lodz B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish O
police O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
on O
the O
ramp O
, O
and O
it O
split O
us O
into O
groups O
and O
took O
us O
to O
an O
empty O
school O
building B-TER
. O

There O
, O
136 O
people B-TER
were O
stuffed O
into O
a O
room B-TER
measuring O
6x6 O
meters O
. O

Our O
living B-TER
conditions O
improved O
, O
and O
thereafter O
78 O
people O
would O
stay O
in O
this O
room O
. O

We O
slept O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
soon O
became O
sick B-TER
with O
angina B-TER
. O

Right O
after O
I O
got O
better O
, O
my O
mother B-PER
came B-TER
down I-TER
with I-TER
pneumonia B-TER
. O

Because O
the O
hospitals B-TER
were O
too O
full O
, O
she O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
floor O
while O
she O
was O
sick B-TER
. O

The O
rainy O
autumn O
weather O
, O
the O
abnormal O
accommodations B-TER
, O
and O
the O
overcrowded O
living B-TER
conditions O
produced O
a O
lot O
filth O
and O
made O
many O
people O
sick B-TER
. O

After O
three O
weeks O
, O
we O
were O
all O
lice B-TER
- I-TER
infested I-TER
and O
there O
was O
practically O
nothing O
we O
could O
do O
to O
prevent O
it O
. O

We O
ate B-TER
the O
last O
of O
the O
food B-TER
we O
brought O
with O
us O
and O
then O
went O
hungry O
. O

We O
received O
20 O
decagrams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
one O
soup B-TER
per O
day O
. O

The O
Polish B-TER
Jews I-TER
did O
n’t O
help O
us O
, O
not O
a O
bit O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
get O
the O
fuel O
for O
heating O
that O
we O
were O
allotted O
and O
received O
less O
and O
worse O
kinds O
of O
potatoes B-TER
and O
vegetables B-TER
than O
they O
did O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
at O
night O
during O
the O
winter O
, O
and O
as O
a O
consequence O
my O
father B-PER
became O
ill B-TER
with O
phlegmon B-TER
and O
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
on O
5 O
. O

. O

1942 O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
as O
a O
blacksmith O
and O
my O
brother B-PER
as O
a O
leatherworker O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1942 O
, O
there O
were O
mass O
deportations O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
which O
emptied O
many O
apartments B-TER
, O
and O
the O
collectives O
were O
gradually O
shut O
down O
. O

In O
June O
1942 O
, O
we O
were O
given O
an O
apartment B-TER
. O

I O
contracted B-TER
a O
bad O
case O
of O
hepatitis B-TER
and O
I O
became O
severely O
weak O
. O

When O
I O
got O
better O
, O
I O
was O
assigned O
easier O
work B-TER
in O
a O
factory O
that O
manufactured O
wooden O
products O
. O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
25,000 O
Jews O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
were O
sent O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

My O
mother B-PER
was O
also O
supposed O
to O
be O
transported B-TER
, O
but O
I O
bribed O
the O
Jewish O
police O
, O
and O
so O
I O
managed O
to O
free O
my O
mother B-PER
. O

But O
her O
mental O
and O
physical O
condition O
was O
very O
poor O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
she O
died B-TER
on O
12 O
. O

10 O
. O

1942 O
. O

My O
brother B-PER
, O
who O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
tied O
to O
a O
bed O
with O
serious O
tuberculosis B-TER
, O
died B-TER
after O
having O
suffered O
greatly O
on O
19 O
. O

11 O
. O

1942 O
. O

I O
buried B-TER
the O
3 O
closest O
and O
dearest O
people O
to O
me O
according O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
funeral I-TER
custom I-TER
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
time O
for O
me O
. O

After O
an O
11 O
hour O
work B-TER
shift O
, O
I O
had O
to O
wash O
my O
own O
laundry O
, O
cook O
my O
own O
meals O
, O
and O
, O
worse O
, O
do O
my O
own O
shopping O
. O

I O
sold O
everything O
that O
I O
had O
, O
I O
earned O
my O
living O
, O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
I O
supported O
myself O
. O

In O
the O
autumn O
of O
1943 O
we O
were O
given O
permission O
to O
send O
parcels B-TER
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

I O
received O
a O
parcel B-TER
from O
my O
friend O
Heinz B-PER
Prossnitz I-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC
every O
week O
, O
which O
elevated O
my O
spirits O
as O
well O
as O
made O
me O
feel O
good O
physically O
. O

The O
liquidation O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
began O
in O
May O
1944 O
, O
since O
the O
front O
was O
advancing O
. O

But O
we O
did O
n’t O
know O
that O
the O
line O
of O
attack O
stopped O
at O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

Because O
we O
believed O
that O
the O
Red B-TER
Army I-TER
would O
arrive O
soon O
, O
we O
ignored O
the O
order O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
hid B-TER
. O

Neither O
machine O
guns O
, O
nor O
any O
other O
harsh O
measures O
against O
us O
could O
n’t O
force O
us O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
were O
terribly O
hungry O
and O
this O
forced O
us O
to O
report O
ourselves O
for O
transport B-TER
. O

On O
June O
22nd O
, O
1944 O
, O
we O
left O
Lodz B-LOC
in O
a O
cattle O
car O
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
a O
place O
where O
the O
first O
thing O
we O
saw O
were O
giant O
chimneys B-TER
with O
tall O
flames O
shooting O
up O
from O
them O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
by O
prisoners B-TER
in O
prison B-TER
garb O
and O
when O
I O
asked O
them O
what O
is O
being O
produced O
in O
the O
factories O
, O
they O
replied O
with O
ironic O
smiles O
: O
chocolate O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
believe O
that O
, O
but O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
our O
fathers O
, O
mothers O
, O
and O
children O
were O
being O
burnt B-TER
in O
them O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
near I-LOC
Auschwitz I-LOC
. O

After O
the O
selection B-TER
process O
, O
we O
were O
sent O
to O
work O
as O
expert O
mechanics O
and O
dismantled O
airplanes O
that O
had O
been O
shot O
down O
. O

Camp B-TER
life O
, O
as O
has O
often O
been O
described O
, O
set O
in O
. O

I O
witnessed O
terrible O
things O
. O

Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Slovak B-TER
, O
and O
Theresienstadt B-TER
transports I-TER
arrived O
. O

This O
lasted O
until O
January O
1945 O
. O

The O
Russians B-TER
once O
again O
attacked O
near O
Krakow B-LOC
and O
threatened O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
. O

We O
were O
evacuated B-TER
on O
January O
18th O
. O

The O
train O
connection O
did O
n’t O
exist O
any O
longer O
and O
so O
we O
set O
out O
in O
wooden O
shoes O
with O
blankets O
and O
one O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
. O

We O
walked B-TER
all O
night O
and O
day O
and O
our O
strength O
disappeared O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
had O
left O
was O
our O
will O
and O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
liberated B-TER
soon O
. O

Hundreds O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies O
of O
those O
who O
marched B-TER
before O
us O
and O
had O
already O
died B-TER
lay O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
fourth O
day O
, O
we O
boarded O
a O
train O
somewhere O
near O
Katowice B-LOC
. O

They O
squeezed O
120 O
of O
us O
into O
one O
open O
car O
and O
, O
without O
giving O
us O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
we O
rode O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
4 O
nights O
. O

We O
were O
numb O
, O
like O
animals O
. O

In O
Mor B-LOC
. I-LOC

Ostrava I-LOC
and O
Přerov B-LOC
, O
the O
inhabitants O
gave O
us O
some O
food B-TER
. O

The O
SS B-TER
shot O
at O
them O
, O
but O
this O
did O
n’t O
stop O
them O
and O
they O
helped O
us O
however O
they O
could O
. O

On O
27 O
. O

1 O
. O

1945 O
, O
our O
death B-TER
transport O
ended O
in O
Mauthausen B-LOC
near O
Linz B-LOC
. O

Without O
getting O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
they O
sent O
us O
off O
to O
the O
hot O
showers O
and O
then O
they O
made O
us O
run O
naked O
and O
wet O
into O
an O
ice O
storm O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
hours O
until O
they O
let O
us O
into O
the O
block B-TER
. O

There O
were O
1,200 O
people B-TER
in O
the O
building B-TER
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
sleep O
for O
4 O
weeks O
. O

The O
Czechs O
there O
stuck O
together O
and O
helped O
us O
get O
food B-TER
whenever O
possible O
. O

In O
February O
1945 O
, O
I O
was O
transported B-TER
to O
Gusen B-LOC
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
ever O
suffered O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
the O
underground O
Messerschmitt O
airplane O
factory O
under O
terrible O
conditions B-TER
: O
not O
enough O
food B-TER
, O
little O
sleep O
, O
dirt O
, O
back O
- O
breaking O
and O
long O
labor B-TER
, O
bad O
air O
, O
beatings O
, O
and O
cold O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
go O
into O
the O
details O
, O
just O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
3 O
months O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
take O
up O
a O
whole O
new O
workforce B-TER
because O
the O
previous O
one O
died B-TER
a O
natural O
death B-TER
is O
enough O
. O

This O
means O
that O
in O
each O
block O
, O
which O
had O
800 O
people B-TER
, O
an O
average O
of O
10 O
prisoners B-TER
died B-TER
every O
day O
. O

When O
I O
was O
at O
my O
worst O
, O
when O
my O
strength O
was O
starting O
to O
leave O
me O
, O
we O
were O
liberated B-TER
: O
on O
May O
5th O
the O
Americans B-TER
disarmed O
our O
guards O
and O
all O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
left O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
found O
shelter O
in O
the O
Czech O
civilian O
labor B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
Linz B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
quickly O
recovered O
. O

On O
May O
18th O
, O
1945 O
, O
I O
returned O
to O
Prague B-LOC
. O

None O
of O
my O
relatives O
returned O

I O
am O
the O
only O
living O

the O
