It O
’s O
freezing O
. O

We O
are O
forced O
to O
huddle O
together O
, O
cold O
and O
hungry O
with O
no O
hay O
in O
the O
railway O
cars O
. O

It O
does O
n’t O
matter O
. O

The O
main O
thing O
is O
that O
we O
’re O
going O
away O
from O
here O
, O
where O
life O
hangs O
by O
a O
thread O
– O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
want O
to O
live O
, O
so O
far O
all O
of O
us O
still O
do O
. O

So O
few O
of O
us O
are O
left O
. O

It O
’s O
freezing O
. O

We O
get O
off O
the O
train O
. O

As O
if O
our O
lethargy O
had O
left O
us O
, O
all O
at O
once O
a O
thousand O
questions O
. O

How O
long O
have O
we O
been O
travelling O
? O
An O
eternity O
. O

Did O
we O
travel O
through O
forests O
, O
silence O
, O
nature O
? O
How O
long O
has O
it O
been O
since O
we O
’ve O
seen O
nature O
? O
Years O
. O

Where O
are O
we O
? O
What O
will O
happen O
? O
There O
, O
a O
sign O
: O
Kr O
. O

Gef O
. O

LagerBergen O
- O
Belsen O
. O

What O
, O
we O
’re O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
? O
That O
would O
be O
wonderful O
, O
the O
girls B-TER
speculate O
, O
and O
we O
slowly O
become O
interested O
in O
our O
fate O
. O

We O
’ve O
arrived O
. O

Stunning O
, O
vast O
moorlands O
in O
full O
bloom O
, O
dark O
purple O
, O
with O
beautifully O
green O
thin O
pines O
greet O
us O
with O
their O
rustling O
. O

A O
smiling O
sun O
in O
its O
full O
beauty O
in O
a O
clear O
winter O
sky O
– O
it O
ca O
n’t O
be O
possible O
that O
we O
are O
going O
to O
our O
deaths B-TER
. O

Not O
possible O
? O
Haha O
. O

What O
is O
it O
? O
Several O
large O
circus O
tents B-TER
. O

They O
’re O
quarters O
for O
about O
12,000 O
women O
. O

On O
the O
ground O
, O
one O
on O
top O
of O
another O
. O

The O
stronger O
one O
has O
seized O
some O
hay O
to O
sleep O
on O
, O
the O
weak O
one O
has O
nothing O
but O
a O
blanket O
. O

There O
are O
no O
socks O
… O
only O
the O
lucky O
ones O
have O
pants O
… O
and O
it O
grows O
more O
freezing O
by O
the O
day O
– O
it O
’s O
November O
. O

Maybe O
something O
or O
someone O
exists O
in O
heaven O
who O
can O
no O
longer O
look O
at O
the O
thousands O
of O
wretched O
, O
emaciated O
women B-TER
undress O
and O
wash O
themselves O
outside O
, O
and O
there O
’s O
so O
little O
water O
and O
no O
rags O
to O
dry O
yourself O
with O
, O
and O
while O
you O
’re O
washing O
yourself O
someone O
steals O
your O
last O
piece O
of O
rag O
in O
their O
wooden O
clog O
. O

The O
sky O
turned O
a O
menacing O
color O
, O
the O
wind O
foreshadows O
a O
catastrophe O
. O

The O
tent O
canvases O
bulge O
. O

It O
’s O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
book O
The O
Rains O
Came O
comes O
to O
me O
unbidden O
and O
I O
feel O
that O
something O
big O
is O
coming O
. O

Only O
lightning O
illuminates O
the O
terrifyingly O
dark O
landscape O
, O
you O
ca O
n’t O
hear O
your O
neighbor O
speak O
over O
the O
wailing O
wind O
– O
the O
canvases O
are O
billowing O
out O
more O
and O
more O
and O
the O
cries O
of O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
our O
calls O
for O
help O
vanish O
in O
the O
canvases O
’ O
struggle O
with O
the O
wooden O
pillars O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
each O
of O
us O
is O
living O
for O
herself O
alone O
. O

Who O
is O
n’t O
thinking O
about O
their O
loved O
ones O
? O
Our O
time O
has O
come O
. O

The O
main O
pole O
of O
the O
tent O
has O
become O
loose O
, O
the O
canvases O
and O
the O
wood O
slide O
between O
our O
bodies O
– O
panic O
, O
screaming O
, O
wailing O
, O
… O
Eva O
, O
Nita O
, O
Anča O
, O
Valina O
– O
are O
you O
alive O
? O
What O
, O
Helga O
? O
. O

. O

. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
who O
did O
n’t O
make O
it O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
twelve O
tents B-TER
, O
only O
one O
, O
badly O
damaged O
, O
remained O
standing O
. O

This O
terrible O
night O
, O
during O
which O
the O
hair O
of O
many O
of O
us O
went O
white O
with O
fear O
, O
was O
followed O
by O
36 O
hours O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
before O
we O
set O
ourselves O
up O
in O
as O
yet O
unsettled O
barracks B-TER
, O
where O
we O
slept O
in O
three O
- O
tier O
bunks O
, O
2 O
in O
each O
bed O
, O
and O
each O
with O
only O
one O
blanket O
, O
beneath O
us O
a O
thin O
straw O
mattress O
. O

Here O
, O
we O
lived O
through O
December O
with O
no O
clothes O
, O
spoon O
, O
or O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
like O
children O
we O
looked O
forward O
to O
Christmas O
when O
we O
could O
perhaps O
receive O
an O
extra O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Around O
December O
12th O
, O
a O
story O
started O
to O
go O
around O
that O
the O
camp B-TER
would O
be O
liquidated O
. O

Almost O
every O
day O
, O
larger O
and O
smaller O
groups O
would O
be O
selected O
and O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Interestingly O
, O
we O
Czechs B-TER
always O
boarded O
in O
an O
orderly O
manner O
, O
while O
female O
prisoners B-TER
of O
other O
nationalities O
were O
constantly O
eluding O
, O
dodging O
, O
etc O
. O

We O
were O
n’t O
selected O
until O
December O
20th O
– O
nobody O
wanted O
us O
, O
we O
were O
too O
weak O
. O

We O
’ll O
be O
left O
in O
peace O
over O
the O
holidays O
, O
I O
speculated O
, O
but O
we O
were O
lucky O
. O

On O
December O
24th O
, O
when O
we O
were O
so O
disappointed O
because O
we O
did O
n’t O
get O
even O
an O
extra O
crumb O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
they O
selected O
us O
and O
we O
heard O
that O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
on O
January O
20th O
. O

Czech B-TER
women I-TER
had O
a O
reputation O
of O
being O
good O
workers O
. O

January O
in O
this O
camp B-TER
was O
horrible O
. O

Transports B-TER
arrived O
constantly O
and O
not O
a O
single O
morning O
went O
by O
when O
there O
was O
n’t O
a O
heap O
of O
dead B-TER
naked O
bodies O
( O
the O
most O
valuable O
thing O
about O
them O
was O
their O
clothes O
) O
in O
front O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

A O
wagon O
came O
by O
regularly O
to O
collect O
them O
. O

Sick B-TER
women O
were O
constantly O
returning O
from O
work B-TER
in O
such O
a O
state O
that O
they O
were O
just O
dragging O
their O
bones O
back O
to O
bed O
. O

This O
is O
how O
our O
friend O
Dr. O
Wolfová B-PER
returned O
. O

Fourteen O
days O
ago O
she O
was O
on O
her O
feet O
and O
now O
she O
could O
n’t O
even O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
– O
she O
was O
covered O
in O
wounds O
… O
We O
were O
increasingly O
beset O
by O
lice O
, O
and O
, O
along O
with O
them O
, O
typhus B-TER
. O

Blocks O
for O
the O
sick B-TER
were O
the O
seals O
of O
the O
numbered O
days O
of O
your O
life O
. O

Yesterday O
was O
January O
20th O
and O
we O
still O
have O
n’t O
left O
. O

What O
? O
Are O
we O
sentenced O
to O
die B-TER
here O
? O
Do O
n’t O
we O
have O
to O
drag O
our O
bones O
to O
another O
region O
? O
At O
least O
to O
properly O
eat B-TER
and O
wash O
ourselves O
– O
and O
then O
let O
God O
’s O
will O
be O
done O
. O

It O
’s O
January O
31th O
, O
it O
’s O
February O
8th O
. O

Dessau B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
are O
going O
, O
has O
certainly O
been O
levelled O
. O

. O

. O

A O
miracle O
occurred O
. O

On O
February O
10th O
, O
while O
the O
last O
turnip O
soup B-TER
was O
being O
doled O
out O
inside O
the O
horrible O
transport O
block O
, O
where O
getting O
food B-TER
meant O
winning O
the O
lottery O
, O
an O
order O
came O
. O

Girls B-TER
, O
we O
’re O
leaving O
. O

Those O
who O
have O
n’t O
eaten B-TER
yet O
wo O
n’t O
get O
anything O
, O
there O
’s O
no O
time O
( O
so O
that O
the O
block O
staff O
can O
eat B-TER
even O
more O
) O
. O

We O
board O
. O

Hanka O
, O
one O
of O
our O
best O
, O
is O
not O
selected O
, O
but O
she O
ca O
n’t O
live O
without O
us O
, O
she O
’s O
one O
of O
the O
poor O
exhausted O
ones O
. O

We O
try O
to O
take O
her O
with O
us O
. O

She O
sneaks O
in O
with O
us O
. O

She O
’s O
fished O
out O
and O
returned O
. O

On O
shaky O
legs O
, O
she O
fearlessly O
tries O
again O
, O
but O
she O
’s O
beaten O
by O
an O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
until O
we O
look O
away O
. O

We O
say O
goodbye O
with O
painful O
looks O
. O

Hanka O
, O
our O
athlete O
, O
our O
girl B-TER
who O
was O
so O
brave O
and O
not O
long O
ago O
recited O
things O
to O
us O
all O
night O
long O
, O
your O
little O
daughter O
is O
waiting O
for O
you O
– O
be O
with O
God O
. O

And O
Eva O
, O
who O
lived O
with O
her O
and O
took O
care O
of O
her O
so O
sweetly O
, O
we O
are O
no O
less O
sad O
than O
you O
. O

Have O
courage O
. O

We O
’re O
setting O
off O
at O
noon O
and O
happy O
to O
cast O
a O
last O
glance O
at O
the O
terrible O
blocks O
, O
wardens O
, O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

What O
lies O
ahead O
for O
us O
? O
It O
shall O
be O
a O
surprise O
