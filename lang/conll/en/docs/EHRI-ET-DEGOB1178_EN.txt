The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
If O
I O
had O
to O
and O
were O
able O
to O
present O
all O
the O
misery O
I O
experienced O
I O
could O
talk O
for O
weeks O
but O
I O
do O
not O
do O
it O
gladly O
as O
remembering O
is O
horrible O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
Aknaszlatina B-LOC
Hungarians B-TER
treated O
us O
in O
a O
horrible O
way O
. O

They O
terribly O
tortured O
us O
, O
grabbed B-TER
all I-TER
our I-TER
valuables I-TER
but O
that O
was O
not O
all O
. O

They O
said O
we O
kept O
treasures O
even O
under O
our O
skin O
, O
and O
they O
treated O
us O
accordingly O
. O

They O
searched O
us O
undressed O
, O
unfortunately O
not O
only O
us O
but O
also O
our O
wives B-TER
and O
daughters B-TER
. O

Even O
high O
- O
ranking O
officers O
watched O
this O
performance O
. O

When O
we O
learnt O
they O
were O
going O
to O
take O
us O
away O
we O
were O
glad O
to O
go O
. O

Anywhere O
, O
just O
away O
from O
there O
. O

Leaving O
behind O
Aknaszlatina B-LOC
we O
travelled O
90 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
freight B-TER
car I-TER
and O
arrived O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
three O
days O
later O
. O

On O
the O
way O
many O
of O
us O
died B-TER
in O
the O
freight O
car O
because O
we O
got O
no O
water O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-LOC
we O
had O
to O
get O
off O
the O
train B-TER
and O
leave O
our O
entire O
luggage O
behind O
. O

Women B-TER
were O
led O
to O
the O
right O
, O
three O
of O
us O
brothers O
and O
my O
father O
to O
the O
left O
. O

Having O
walked O
a O
little O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
also O
our O
father O
was O
separated B-TER
from O
us O
. O

The O
day O
after O
, O
we O
were O
moved O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
three O
days O
. O

We O
got O
tattoos O
here O
and O
went O
on O
to O
Buna B-LOC
, O
8 O
kilometres O
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

We O
had O
to O
lay O
cables O
in O
the O
ground O
. O

We O
had O
to O
carry O
heavy O
cables O
in O
a O
distance O
of O
4 O
kilometres O
; O
my O
back O
aches O
even O
today O
if O
I O
think O
of O
it O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
our O
camp B-TER
was O
clean O
and O
we O
also O
got O
food B-TER
. O

They O
harmed O
only O
those O
who O
could O
not O
work B-TER
, O
but O
they O
would O
beat O
these O
people B-TER
ruthlessly O
. O

When O
the O
front O
got O
closer O
they O
transferred O
us O
into O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

We O
travelled O
130 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
little O
open O
freight O
car O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
of O
January O
. O

We O
received O
500 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
the O
journey O
. O

Many O
perished B-TER
during O
this O
journey O
. O

12,000 O
people B-TER
departed O
but O
I O
doubt O
there O
were O
as O
many O
as O
6,000 O
of O
us O
when O
we O
arrived O
. O

When O
we O
got O
off O
the O
train B-TER
the O
SS B-TER
immediately O
approached O
and O
shot O
the O
people B-TER
who O
could O
not O
walk O
but O
sat O
down O
. O

Naturally O
, O
we O
had O
to O
watch O
it O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
; O
otherwise O
they O
would O
have O
shot O
us O
as O
well O
, O
since O
they O
had O
the O
weapon O
. O

In O
Buchenwald B-LOC
we O
got O
into O
quarantine O
. O

We O
did O
not O
work B-TER
here O
at O
all O
as O
this O
was O
a O
selecting B-TER
place O
. O

In O
the O
cold O
of O
January O
, O
in O
the O
freezing O
cold O
of O
the O
mornings O
we O
were O
being O
lined O
up O
for O
2 O
- O
6 O
hours O
during O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
suffer O
unbearably O
. O

Many O
died B-TER
during O
the O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
. O

They O
just O
threw O
these O
people B-TER
out O
of O
line O
. O

Crematorium B-TER
was O
working O
day O
and O
night O
but O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
the O
great O
number O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
. O

Later O
, O
I O
was O
singled O
out O
from O
block O
51 O
and O
got O
into O
the O
youthful O
block O
, O
no O
. O

66 O
. O

We O
did O
not O
work B-TER
either O
here O
but O
at O
least O
we O
did O
not O
need O
to O
leave O
the O
block O
but O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
inside O
. O

It O
was O
somewhat O
better O
here O
. O

Our O
leader O
was O
a O
Czech B-TER
who O
treated O
us O
so O
nicely O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
find O
the O
words O
to O
describe O
it O
. O

He O
treated O
us O
like O
a O
father O
his O
children O
. O

Although O
he O
was O
also O
a O
prisoner B-TER
, O
with O
limited O
opportunities O
, O
he O
still O
managed O
to O
obtain O
even O
food B-TER
for O
us O
. O

The O
English B-ORG
were O
already O
quite O
close O
when O
we O
were O
also O
taken O
away O
after O
8 O
weeks O
of O
stay O
. O

There O
were O
60,000 O
people B-TER
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
of O
very O
diverse O
nationalities O
, O
out O
of O
whom O
10,000 O
of O
us O
were O
Jews O
. O

I O
can O
not O
give O
dates O
, O
since O
we O
were O
not O
humans O
here O
, O
but O
lived O
like O
the O
most O
miserable O
beasts O
. O

In O
April O
, O
when O
, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
, O
English B-ORG
troops O
got O
closer O
, O
we O
left O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

They O
hurriedly O
entrained O
us O
in O
Weima B-LOC
r O
, O
putting O
100 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
car O
. O

Travelling O
for O
14 O
days O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
( O
since O
there O
was O
no O
place O
where O
they O
accepted O
us O
) O
, O
we O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
where O
Russians B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

My O
future O
plans O
? O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

First O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
there O
are O
surviving O
members O
of O
my O
family B-TER
, O
and O
will O
make O
plans O
only O
afterwards O
. O
