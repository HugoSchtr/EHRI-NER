regarding O

to O
report O
that O
a O
new O
bill B-TER
calling O
for O
a O
gradual O
diminution O
of O
ritual B-TER
slaughter I-TER
over O
the O
next O
three O

has O

[ O

In O
discussing O
with O
the O
leaders B-TER
of I-TER
various I-TER
Jewish I-TER
groups I-TER
their O
reactions O
, O
I O
gained O
the O
impression O
that O
it O
is O
mainly O
the O
orthodox O
, O
and O
even O
amongst O
their O
number O
the O
more O
strictly O
religious O
, O
who O
, O
from O
a O
religious B-TER
angle I-TER
are O
seriously O
concerned O
over O
the O
prospect O
of O
eventually O
doing O
away O
with O
ritual B-TER
slaughter I-TER
. O

Others O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Zionists B-TER
, O
and O
the O
Zionist O
Revisionists O
, O
and O
particularly O
the O
youth B-TER
thereof O
, O
are O
less O
concerned O
by O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
potential O
effect O
on O
ritual B-TER
slaughter I-TER
than O
by O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
presaging O
further O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
. O

One O
prominent O
member O
of O
the O
Zionist O
Revisionist O
inner O
circles O
imparted O
his O
opinion O
that O
the O
bill B-TER
was O
aimed O
mainly O
as O
propaganda B-TER
to O
force O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
all O
categories O
in O
Poland B-LOC
to O
unite O
in O
support O
of O
the O
Government B-TER
search O
for O
a O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
, O
mainly O
in O
terms O
of O
emigration B-TER
. O

[ O
… O
] O
My O
own O
observation O
led O
me O
to O
believe O
that O
contributing O
to O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
proposal O
there O
are O
the O
following O
military O
and O
social O
aspects O
: O
military O
, O
in O
that O
the O
Army B-TER
’s I-TER
long O
- O
range O
program O
envisages O
the O
eventual O
centralization O
of O
meat O
control O
and O
refrigeration O
to O
meet O
emergency O
periods O
; O
and O
socially O
, O
in O
that O
the O
racial O
Polish B-LOC
peasant O
wants O
to O
replace O
the O
Jew B-TER
in O
the O
meat O
business B-TER
. O

As O
to O
the O
prospects O
of O
the O
bill B-TER
’s I-TER
amendment O
, O
this O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
will O
depend O
largely O
upon O
the O
Government B-TER
’s I-TER
attitude B-TER
in O
general O
towards O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
I O
do O
not O
look O
for O
the O
bill B-TER
to O
be O
rejected O
