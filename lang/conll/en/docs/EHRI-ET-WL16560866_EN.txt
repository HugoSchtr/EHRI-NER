Children B-TER
who O
survived B-TER
the O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
It O
might O
be O
interesting O
, O
not O
only O
for O
human O
interest O
but O
also O
for O
psychological O
and O
pedagogical O
reasons O
, O
to O
have O
a O
detailed O
report O
about O
the O
lives O
of O
sixteen O
to O
eighteen O
young O
children B-TER
who O
came O
to O
England B-LOC
from O
the O
European B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
in O
1945 O
. O

They O
arrived O
in O
different O
transports B-TER
, O
mainly O
of O
adolescents B-TER
. O

Most O
of O
these O
little O
ones O
came O
with O
the O
first O
group O
of O
300 O
children B-TER
and O
their O
first O
home B-TER
was O
the O
nursery O
of O
the O
big O
reception O
camp B-TER
in O
Windermere B-LOC
. O

Most O
were O
between O
three O
and O
five O
years O
old O
, O
with O
a O
few O
between O
six O
and O
seven O
. O

They O
were O
miserable O
little O
creatures O
, O
all O
of O
them O
well O
below O
the O
normal O
size O
for O
their O
age O
, O
and O
they O
were O
extremely O
irritable O
. O

The O
heads O
of O
many O
of O
them O
were O
shaven O
and O
covered O
with O
rashes B-TER
, O
and O
they O
suffered O
from O
all O
kinds O
of O
skin B-TER
diseases I-TER
. O

At O
first O
, O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
house B-TER
sounded O
like O
a O
zoo O
, O
with O
screaming O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Although O
there O
was O
one O
nurse O
for O
every O
two O
or O
three O
children B-TER
, O
that O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
. O

Each O
child B-TER
wanted O
the O
undivided O
love O
and O
care O
of O
one O
person B-TER
for O
him- O
or O
herself O
. O

Although O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
toys O
, O
the O
children B-TER
would O
grab O
whatever O
another O
child B-TER
was O
holding O
. O

An O
adult O
who O
had O
been O
busy O
with O
these O
children B-TER
for O
about O
five O
hours O
would O
be O
completely O
exhausted O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O

There O
was O
no O
indication O
that O
– O
even O
with O
the O
utmost O
patience O
– O
it O
could O
be O
possible O
in O
a O
few O
years O
for O
these O
little O
animal O
creatures O
to O
react O
like O
human O
beings O
when O
approached O
. O

It O
was O
Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
– O
the O
children B-TER
simply O
call O
her O
Alice B-PER
– O
who O
devoted O
herself O
to O
their O
problems O
, O
just O
as O
she O
had O
previously O
to O
other O
tasks O
. O

She O
had O
been O
well O
known O
in O
Germany B-LOC
as O
a O
fully O
trained O
social O
worker B-TER
, O
running O
the O
Jewish O
crèche O
in O
the O
Grolmannstrasse B-LOC
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

The O
well O
- O
ordered O
life O
of O
the O
toddlers B-TER
, O
with O
sleep O
, O
personal O
hygiene B-TER
, O
food B-TER
, O
play O
and O
almost O
full O
- O
time O
outdoor O
activities O
in O
those O
wonderful O
summer O
weeks O
, O
worked O
wonders O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
the O
children B-TER
look O
different O
physically O
, O
one O
could O
sense O
that O
they O
were O
calming O
down O
; O
they O
gradually O
became O
more O
confident O
that O
the O
next O
day O
they O
would O
not O
be O
robbed O
of O
what O
they O
had O
been O
given O
the O
day O
before O
. O

After O
about O
three O
months O
in O
the O
large O
general O
reception O
camp B-TER
( O
which O
despite O
the O
psychological O
drawbacks O
had O
the O
positive O
effect O
of O
careful O
daily O
medical B-TER
supervision O
) O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
to O
move O
Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
and O
her O
little O
ones O
, O
together O
with O
most O
of O
her O
staff O
, O
into O
a O
home B-TER
of O
their O
own O
, O
in O
a O
lovely O
rural O
area O
near O
London B-LOC
, O
Lingfield B-LOC
in O
Surrey B-LOC
. O

This O
home B-TER
has O
proved O
to O
be O
their O
real O
Zuhause O
home O
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
and O
Alice B-PER
has O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
woman B-TER
who O
loves O
them O
like O
a O
mother O
but O
is O
not O
their O
mother O
( O
Alice B-PER
's I-PER
words O
) O
when O
the O
children B-TER
ask O
her O
whether O
she O
has O
now O
become O
their O
mother B-TER
. O

They O
love O
every O
single O
day O
they O
spend O
in O
this O
home B-TER
. O

A O
little O
girl B-TER
said O
: O
I O
do O
n’t O
like O
supper O
, O
because O
then O
we O
soon O
have O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
. O

I O
like O
breakfast O
best O
because O
it O
’s O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
whole O
new O
day O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fairytale O
home B-TER
, O
almost O
too O
beautiful O
and O
therefore O
almost O
unreal O
for O
an O
adult O
who O
takes O
a O
lively O
interest O
in O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
our O
world O
, O
in O
the O
problems O
of O
our O
era O
now O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
. O

A O
large O
, O
long O
, O
two O
- O
storey O
manor O
house B-TER
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
huge O
hilly O
park O
, O
with O
wide O
lawns O
, O
great O
stands O
of O
trees O
, O
flowerbeds O
and O
orchards O
, O
and O
a O
swimming O
pool O
reserved O
for O
the O
children B-TER
provided O
by O
an O
old O
Jewish O
Sir O
. O

The O
furnishings B-TER
are O
simple O
and O
appropriate O
: O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
a O
very O
big O
playroom B-TER
with O
a O
grand O
piano B-TER
and O
glass O
doors O
opening O
onto O
the O
garden O
; O
next O
to O
it O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
, O
with O
lots O
of O
tables O
covered O
with O
oilcloth O
and O
light O
and O
cheerful O
colours O
and O
flowers O
everywhere O
. O

One O
the O
first O
floor O
there O
are O
bedrooms B-TER
with O
colourful O
blankets O
( O
each O
child B-TER
has O
their O
own O
small O
wardrobe O
) O
, O
three O
bathrooms B-TER
, O
lots O
of O
side O
rooms B-TER
and O
pleasant O
rooms B-TER
for O
the O
staff O
. O

This O
house B-TER
provides O
for O
a O
few O
years O
an O
ideal O
setting O
for O
convalescence O
, O
tranquillity O
and O
seclusion O
. O

Here O
the O
children B-TER
find O
peace O
, O
and O
from O
here O
they O
become O
acquainted O
with O
English B-LOC
children B-TER
of O
their O
own O
age O
, O
and O
the O
older O
ones O
go O
to O
school B-TER
. O

Now O
when O
you O
visit O
Lingfield B-LOC
House I-LOC
you O
meet O
healthy B-TER
-looking O
, O
beaming O
children B-TER
, O
spontaneous O
and O
at O
ease O
in O
their O
responses O
, O
who O
feel O
they O
are O
loved O
and O
understood O
, O
who O
play O
imaginatively O
and O
like O
to O
help O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
around O
the O
house B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
go O
to O
school B-TER
are O
almost O
all O
good O
pupils O
. O

The O
all O
feel O
they O
are O
one O
family B-TER
. O

This O
is O
best O
illustrated O
by O
the O
following O
little O
story O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
a O
six O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy B-TER
was O
visited O
by O
one O
of O
the O
financial B-TER
sponsors O
of O
the O
home B-TER
and O
was O
given O
a O
balloon O
, O
which O
made O
him O
extremely O
happy O
. O

Then O
he O
was O
told O
that O
he O
could O
now O
have O
something O
bigger O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
for O
a O
balloon O
for O
each O
child B-TER
at O
the O
home B-TER
. O

This O
is O
what O
you O
can O
see O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
a O
superficial O
picture O
, O
but O
a O
real O
insight O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
children B-TER
lead O
the O
real O
lives B-TER
of O
children B-TER
, O
that O
they O
have O
become O
children B-TER
again O
. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
doubt O
either O
that O
they O
live O
with O
the O
horrors O
of O
their O
past O
, O
both O
consciously O
and O
unconsciously O
. O

It O
was O
the O
family O
atmosphere O
at O
Lingfield B-LOC
which O
gradually O
encouraged O
them O
to O
talk O
. O

One O
evening O
, O
while O
she O
was O
having O
a O
bath B-TER
, O
a O
little O
girl B-TER
of O
about O
seven O
suddenly O
spoke O
about O
how O
her O
mother B-TER
was O
shot B-TER
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
and O
how O
she O
was O
horrified O
when O
she O
saw O
her O
lying O
there O
dead B-TER
and O
her O
little O
brother B-TER
being O
taken O
out O
of O
his O
pram O
. O

She O
ended O
by O
saying O
: O
Now O
we O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
speak O
about O
MuttiMummy O
any O
more O
. O

This O
girl B-TER
, O
who O
from O
the O
start O
seemed O
the O
most O
disturbed O
, O
had O
unfortunately O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
home B-TER
for O
mentally B-TER
disturbed I-TER
children B-TER
[ O
for O
] O
she O
could O
not O
stay O
with O
the O
other O
children B-TER
. O

It O
was O
she O
who O
, O
on O
the O
first O
evening O
in O
Windermere B-LOC
, O
had O
wandered O
through O
the O
house B-TER
screaming O
Do O
n’t O
take O
my O
little O
brother O
away O
. O

You O
wo O
n’t O
take O
my O
little O
brother O
, O
will O
you O
? O
She O
was O
always O
on O
the O
watch O
for O
cats B-TER
and O
dogs B-TER
, O
or O
something O
else O
that O
might O
frighten B-TER
her O
. O

As O
she O
was O
very O
graceful O
and O
responsive O
to O
music B-TER
, O
and O
sometimes O
even O
started O
to O
dance O
, O
it O
had O
been O
hoped O
at O
first O
that O
this O
would O
lead O
her O
to O
normality O
so O
that O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
stay O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
. O

A O
nine O
- O
year O
- O
old O
boy B-TER
who O
– O
as O
was O
known O
– O
had O
been O
hidden B-TER
before O
being O
taken O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
often O
talks O
about O
death B-TER
, O
killing B-TER
, O
maltreatment B-TER
, O
but O
sometimes O
only O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
interesting O
adventure O
. O

Only O
recently O
did O
one O
of O
the O
older O
boys B-TER
tell O
how O
he O
had O
been O
systematically O
maltreated B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
to O
make O
him O
betray O
the O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
of O
his O
elder O
brother B-TER
. O

But O
this O
little O
lad O
, O
then O
not O
yet O
seven O
years O
old O
, O
had O
not O
given O
his O
brother B-TER
away O
despite O
the O
ill O
- O
treatment O
. O

When O
he O
came O
to O
Lingfield B-LOC
, O
very O
pale O
and O
thin O
, O
he O
fell O
ill O
almost O
immediately O
, O
suffering O
seizures O
in O
which O
he O
tore O
his O
clothes B-TER
from O
his O
body O
. O

Now O
he O
is O
physically O
fit O
, O
sings O
beautifully O
, O
and O
demonstrates O
strength O
of O
character O
, O
as O
well O
as O
kindness O
( O
eg O
towards O
younger O
children B-TER
) O
and O
a O
longing O
for O
excitement O
. O

Dennie O
was O
about O
four O
years O
old O
when O
he O
came O
to O
Windermere B-LOC
; O
now O
he O
is O
six O
, O
a O
frail O
, O
strange O
child B-TER
with O
fair O
curls O
and O
dark O
, O
distant O
eyes O
. O

He O
is O
extremely O
sensitive O
, O
can O
not O
bear O
any O
noise O
and O
is O
physically O
under O
- O
developed O
. O

He O
often O
speaks O
about O
God B-TER
: O
Where O
is O
God O
? O
Is O
God O
a O
He O
or O
a O
She O
? O
Is O
He O
up O
in O
the O
sky O
or O
below O
ground O
? O
Such O
are O
his O
questions O
. O

When O
he O
received O
a O
toy O
telephone O
for O
his O
birthday O
he O
said O
: O
I O
was O
lucky O
that O
I O
was O
not O
killed O
when O
I O
was O
a O
baby O
, O
was O
n’t O
I O
? O
Otherwise O
I O
would O
never O
have O
got O
the O
telephone O
. O

He O
asked O
his O
nurse O
: O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
my O
parents O
were O
shotdead O
? O
And O
then O
, O
When O
I O
am O
grown O
up O
I O
’ll O
marry O
Tanja O
[ O
his O
sister O
] O
and O
we O
’ll O
live O
in O
a O
small O
house O
, O
because O
we O
do O
n’t O
like O
many O
people O
around O
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
, O
while O
having O
his O
bath B-TER
, O
he O
urged O
his O
nurse O
to O
have O
a O
baby B-TER
: O
You O
must O
have O
a O
baby O
, O
for O
there O
is O
a O
baby O
that O
wants O
to O
be O
born O
. O

He O
is O
commended O
at O
school B-TER
for O
his O
achievements O
but O
still O
says O
, O
with O
the O
suffering O
face O
of O
an O
old O
man O
, O
My O
head O
is O
often O
completely O
empty O
, O
you O
know O
. O

Tanja O
, O
his O
sister B-TER
, O
is O
three O
years O
older O
and O
gives O
the O
impression O
of O
a O
clumsy O
and O
also O
mentally B-TER
extremely O
inflexible O
child B-TER
. O

She O
does O
not O
get O
on O
well O
at O
school B-TER
and O
loves O
smaller O
children B-TER
especially O
because O
to O
those O
she O
is O
superior O
. O

But O
she O
has O
one O
special O
talent O
: O
she O
dances O
beautifully O
. O

When O
dancing O
she O
is O
completely O
changed O
, O
she O
is O
a O
free O
little O
being O
. O

Every O
evening O
a O
group O
of O
children B-TER
sing B-TER
, O
forming O
a O
circle O
round O
Tanja O
who O
dances O
in O
the O
middle O
. O

This O
evening O
dance O
makes O
her O
calm O
and O
relaxed O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
gains O
her O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
others O
. O

Only O
once O
did O
she O
talk O
about O
her O
parental O
home B-TER
. O

Everything O
there O
had O
been O
bigger O
and O
much O
more O
beautiful O
than O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
: O
the O
garden O
, O
the O
house O
, O
just O
everything O
! O
She O
also O
talked O
about O
a O
sweet O
baby B-TER
with O
curly O
hair O
that O
they O
had O
had O
( O
certainly O
Dennie O
): O
much O
, O
much O
nicer O
that O
Dennie O
. O

She O
needed O
much O
more O
exclusive O
attention O
, O
more O
love O
and O
empathy O
, O
than O
the O
home B-TER
could O
give O
her O
since O
there O
were O
fifteen O
children B-TER
. O

A O
ten O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
came O
to O
Lingfield B-LOC
with O
her O
little O
three O
- O
year O
- O
old O
sister B-TER
( O
a O
brother B-TER
who O
was O
between O
them O
in O
age O
had O
died B-TER
) O
. O

When O
she O
arrived O
she O
resembled O
an O
old O
woman B-TER
in O
posture O
and O
outward O
appearance O
; O
she O
was O
completely O
covered O
in O
a O
rash B-TER
which O
she O
had O
caught O
from O
another O
girl B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

She O
had O
not O
wanted O
to O
hurt O
the O
other O
girl B-TER
’s I-TER
feelings O
, O
so O
she O
had O
stayed O
with O
her O
. O

She O
was O
very O
desperate O
because O
of O
her O
poor O
condition O
and O
at O
first O
she O
was O
very O
shy O
and O
continually O
depressed B-TER
. O

Later O
she O
told O
how O
one O
night O
she O
had O
dreamt O
distinctly O
of O
her O
mother B-TER
’s I-TER
death B-TER
and O
how O
her O
mother B-TER
had O
asked O
her O
to O
look O
after O
her O
younger O
brother B-TER
and O
sister B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
she O
had O
learnt O
that O
that O
had O
been O
the O
very O
night O
when O
her O
mother B-TER
died B-TER
. O

She O
says O
: O
Still O
, O
I O
ca O
n’t O
hate O
the O
Germans O
, O
and O
on O
another O
occasion O
she O
said O
: O
I O
believe O
that O
all O
religion O
is O
love O
. O

These O
few O
examples O
may O
suffice O
to O
show O
the O
reader O
to O
what O
extent O
these O
young O
orphans B-TER
, O
much O
more O
than O
other O
children B-TER
, O
are O
faced O
with O
the O
great O
and O
eternal O
questions O
of O
mankind O
, O
and O
how O
their O
souls O
really O
can O
not O
cope O
with O
them O
. O

For O
all O
of O
them O
death O
is O
something O
real O
and O
concrete O
. O

They O
have O
been O
continually O
surrounded O
by O
it O
. O

They O
simply O
do O
not O
understand O
that O
someone O
can O
die O
without O
being O
killed B-TER
by O
another O
person B-TER
. O

When O
a O
child B-TER
in O
another O
home B-TER
was O
hit O
by O
a O
car O
and O
died B-TER
they O
immediately O
suspected O
one O
of O
his O
friends O
had O
murdered B-TER
him O
. O

They O
all O
talked O
excitedly O
about O
that O
event O
, O
which O
haunted O
them O
for O
weeks O
. O

It O
is O
incomprehensible O
why O
from O
all O
the O
countless O
children B-TER
who O
were O
killed B-TER
just O
these O
survived B-TER
. O

It O
is O
known O
that O
one O
mother B-TER
said O
before O
she O
was O
taken O
away O
that O
her O
little O
girls B-TER
, O
who O
were O
about O
the O
same O
size O
, O
were O
twins O
– O
because O
these O
were O
at O
first O
saved O
for O
medical B-TER
experiments I-TER
. O

In O
some O
cases O
neither O
the O
real O
names O
nor O
any O
dates O
are O
known O
. O

A O
little O
girl B-TER
explained O
with O
a O
beaming O
smile O
that O
Alice B-PER
had O
declared O
a O
certain O
day O
to O
be O
her O
birthday O
, O
and O
now O
she O
too O
could O
have O
a O
lovely O
birthday O
party O
, O
just O
like O
the O
others O
. O

The O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
physical O
state O
of O
health B-TER
is O
– O
as O
already O
mentioned O
– O
generally O
good O
. O

Their O
food B-TER
is O
simple O
and O
nourishing O
, O
they O
get O
plenty O
of O
vegetables B-TER
and O
fruit B-TER
grown O
in O
the O
garden O
. O

At O
first O
they O
could O
not O
be O
persuaded O
to O
eat B-TER
lettuce B-TER
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
like O
it O
, O
we O
’ve O
scoffed O
enough O
grass O
in O
the O
camp O
they O
said O
. O

There O
are O
children B-TER
of O
many O
different O
nations O
: O
Italy B-LOC
, O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
Romania B-LOC
, O
Germany B-LOC
, O
Austria B-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Their O
common O
language O
now O
is O
English B-LOC
, O
which O
they O
have O
learnt O
extremely O
quickly O
, O
just O
like O
a O
game O
, O
and O
which O
they O
speak O
at O
school B-TER
. O

At O
present O
there O
are O
no O
definite O
ideas O
about O
their O
future O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
children B-TER
need O
the O
warmth O
and O
feeling O
of O
togetherness O
of O
a O
close O
family B-TER
circle O
, O
and O
there O
are O
enough O
people B-TER
who O
would O
be O
ready O
to O
adopt B-TER
them O
. O

But O
so O
far O
only O
a O
few O
adoptions B-TER
have O
been O
permitted O
, O
in O
cases O
where O
there O
was O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
prospective O
parents O
were O
really O
prepared O
and O
sensitive O
enough O
to O
accept O
such O
a O
child B-TER
with O
all O
their O
problems O
, O
which O
might O
not O
yet O
be O
foreseeable O
. O

Among O
others O
there O
are O
a O
doctor B-TER
, O
who O
is O
a O
child B-TER
psychologist B-TER
, O
and O
a O
kindergarten B-TER
teacher O
, O
trained O
in O
psychology B-TER
, O
both O
of O
whom O
are O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
great O
task O
and O
responsibility O
they O
face O
, O
and O
they O
have O
adopted B-TER
one O
child B-TER
each O
. O

One O
child B-TER
is O
a O
very O
charming O
but O
very O
nervous B-TER
little O
boy B-TER
, O
the O
other O
a O
five O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
who O
is O
a O
simple O
character O
who O
had O
at O
first O
been O
considered O
to O
be O
mentally B-TER
retarded I-TER
and O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
a O
Child B-TER
Guidance O
Clinic B-TER
for O
a O
period O
of O
observation O
. O

There O
they O
discovered O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
setback O
in O
her O
development O
which O
she O
is O
gradually O
overcoming O
. O

She O
is O
definitely O
not O
what O
you O
would O
call O
an O
attractive O
child B-TER
, O
but O
she O
is O
lovable O
and O
needs O
a O
lot O
of O
affection O
. O

An O
operation O
to O
cure O
her O
squint O
has O
helped O
considerably O
to O
promote O
her O
development O
. O

I O
must O
say O
, O
it O
is O
very O
unusual O
in O
a O
case O
like O
this O
that O
there O
is O
someone O
willing O
to O
do O
everything O
for O
the O
girl B-TER
and O
is O
happy O
with O
this O
child B-TER
and O
the O
progress O
she O
is O
making O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
time O
now O
to O
make O
the O
children B-TER
more O
familiar O
with O
real O
life B-TER
, O
to O
end O
their O
rural O
isolation O
. O

And O
so O
the O
home B-TER
is O
planning O
to O
move O
to O
London B-LOC
in O
the O
near O
future O
, O
and O
they O
hope O
to O
find O
a O
simple O
house B-TER
and O
garden O
somewhere O
on O
the O
outskirts O
. O

There O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
even O
more O
than O
in O
Lingfield B-LOC
to O
meet O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
needs O
: O
some O
need O
continuing O
contact O
with O
experienced O
child B-TER
psychologists B-TER
, O
others O
need O
better O
schools B-TER
which O
will O
meet O
their O
individual O
needs O
to O
a O
greater O
extent O
, O
and O
others O
again O
could O
do O
with O
more O
varied O
lessons O
in O
accordance O
with O
their O
special O
talents O
. O

Perhaps O
there O
will O
be O
more O
adoptions B-TER
in O
time O
. O

But O
a O
small O
nucleus O
of O
children B-TER
who O
can O
not O
be O
transplanted O
will O
stay O
and O
form O
a O
kind O
of O
natural O
family B-TER
. O

Alice B-PER
Goldberger I-PER
will O
go O
on O
guiding O
their O
education B-TER
in O
the O
most O
caring O
and O
attentive O
way O
until O
they O
start O
work B-TER
or O
go O
on O
to O
vocational B-TER
training I-TER
. O
