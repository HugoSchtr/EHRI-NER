On O
April O
16 O
, O
1938 O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
inhabitants I-TER
of O
Kittsee B-LOC
and O
Pama B-LOC
, I-LOC
Burgenland I-LOC
, I-LOC
Austria I-LOC
, O
were O
ejected O
from O
their O
homes O
, O
robbed O
of O
what O
money O
and O
identity O
papers O
they O
had O
and O
, O
during O
the O
night O
, O
marooned O
on O
some O
small O
island O
in O
the O
Czech B-LOC
section O
of O
the O
Danube B-LOC
. O

On O
April O
17 O
, O
they O
were O
found O
by O
the O
Czech B-LOC
frontier O
guard O
and O
taken O
to O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

That O
very O
same O
day O
they O
were O
expelled O
from O
Czecho B-LOC
- I-LOC
Slovakia I-LOC
and O
once O
again O
taken O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
border O
. O

On O
a O
narrow O
streak O
, O
“ O
No O
- O
man’s O
- O
land O
” O
, O
somewhere O
between O
the O
borders O
of O
Czecho B-LOC
- I-LOC
Slovakia I-LOC
, O
Hungaria B-LOC
and O
Austria B-LOC
, O
they O
spent O
three O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
in O
the O
bitter O
cold O
, O
half O
starved O
, O
and O
without O
a O
roof O
over O
their O
heads O
, O
between O
the O
fixed O
bayonets O
of O
the O
sentries O
of O
all O
3 O
countries O
which O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
, O
17 O
in O
all O
, O
managed O
to O
get O
back O
to O
Kittsee B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
old O
men O
and O
children O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
cellar O
, O
and O
the O
grown O
ups O
, O
men O
and O
women O
, O
were O
made O
do O
hard O
scrubbing B-TER
work I-TER
. O

Exhausted O
from O
3 O
days O
’ O
starving O
, O
the O
poor O
people O
’s O
strength O
threatened O
to O
fail O
, O
but O
ruthless O
beating O
put O
them O
to O
work B-TER
again O
. O

During O
the O
night O
, O
after O
a O
30 O
miles O
walk O
, O
they O
were O
taken O
back O
to O
the O
Czech B-LOC
frontier O
. O

At O
long O
last O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Bratislava B-LOC
found O
a O
temporary O
way O
- O
out O
. O

They O
hired O
a O
tug O
- O
boat O
, O
which O
landed O
on O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
side O
of O
the O
Danube B-LOC
, O
near O
Royka B-LOC
, O
and O
received O
the O
people O
, O
68 O
altogether O
, O
agricultural O
workers O
and O
merchants O
, O
infants O
and O
80 O
years O
old O
men O
. O

No O
country O
along O
the O
Danube B-LOC
being O
prepared O
to O
grant O
the O
refugees B-TER
leave O
on O
land O
, O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
authorities O
extend O
the O
permit O
from O
week O
to O
week O
, O
hoping O
that O
the O
Jewish B-TER
organisations I-TER
will O
secure O
their O
emigration B-TER
overseas O
. O

It O
is O
now O
three O
months O
that O
these O
people O
, O
smitten O
with O
despair O
, O
refused O
by O
every O
country O
, O
and O
even O
grudged O
the O
stay O
aboard O
the O
ship O
– O
it O
is O
now O
three O
months O
that O
they O
are O
thus O
kept O
in O
the O
vague O
hope O
of O
salvation O
. O

Efforts O
were O
made O
to O
induce O
various O
countries O
overseas O
to O
receive O
these O
unfortunates O
. O

Though O
some O
of O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O
boat O
managed O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
, O
the O
majority O
could O
not O
be O
emigrated B-TER
, O
being O
unable O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
requirements O
set O
up O
by O
the O
countries O
overseas O
. O

It O
was O
in O
full O
realisation O
of O
this O
plight O
of O
theirs O
that O
we O
went O
to O
see O
the O
refugees B-TER
on O
the O
boat O
, O
on O
July O
10 O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
their O
unspeakable O
mental O
distress O
, O
even O
increased O
by O
physical O
torture O
, O
as O
they O
either O
must O
stay O
in O
the O
narrow O
rooms O
downstairs O
which O
are O
infested O
with O
rats O
and O
vermin O
, O
or O
on O
the O
upper O
deck O
where O
they O
are O
left O
to O
the O
weather O
’s O
mood O
. O

There O
must O
be O
an O
end O
to O
this O
awful O
tragedy O
. O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
that O
Jewry B-TER
must O
suffer O
all O
the O
humiliation O
that O
is O
being O
heaped O
upon O
it O
? O
Are O
we O
going O
to O
proclaim O
no O
, O
before O
the O
whole O
world O
, O
our O
utter O
helplessness O
, O
deliver O
up O
these O
poorest O
of O
the O
poor O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
allow O
a O
mass O
suicide B-TER
? O
We O
have O
taken O
down O
all O
particulars O
of O
every O
one O
of O
these O
unfortunates O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
, O
worked O
out O
a O
plan O
to O
lead O
this O
problem O
towards O
its O
solution O
, O
it O
being O
in O
the O
last O
resort O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
question O
of O
finance O
