The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
There O
were O
thirty O
Jewish O
families B-TER
living O
in O
Csepe B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
farmers O
, O
craftsmen O
, O
tradesmen O
; O
most O
of O
them O
lived O
in O
financially O
sound O
circumstances O
. O

We O
had O
land O
and O
we O
also O
lived O
in O
wealth O
. O

One O
day O
after O
Passover B-TER
the O
Jewish O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
village O
were O
driven O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
but O
we O
were O
sent O
home O
from O
there O
and O
we O
were O
told O
to O
collect O
our O
most O
necessary O
clothes B-TER
, O
underwear O
and O
food B-TER
, O
then O
we O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
barn O
. O

Two O
days O
later O
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

In O
Nagyszöllős B-LOC
we O
spent O
the O
first O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
where O
they O
deprived B-TER
us O
of O
all O
our O
more O
valuable O
belongings O
, O
then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
five O
weeks O
. O

József B-PER
Jarusil I-PER
, O
village O
notary B-TER
reported B-TER
against O
our O
father O
and O
based O
on O
that O
he O
was O
interned O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
as O
a O
communist B-TER
. O

He O
was O
locked O
up O
there O
for O
five O
weeks O
, O
during O
which O
time O
he O
was O
beaten B-TER
very O
much O
and O
a O
stripe O
had O
been O
cut O
in O
his O
hair O
already O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
set O
off O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
together O
with O
our O
father O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
know O
, O
nobody O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
those O
who O
died B-TER
, O
died B-TER
of O
natural O
causes O
, O
although O
they O
beat B-TER
us O
very O
cruelly O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
especially O
the O
wealthier O
people O
. O

The O
gendarmes B-TER
invented O
all O
sorts O
of O
tortures O
, O
they O
found O
fault O
with O
everything O
and O
they O
took O
every O
opportunity O
to O
treat O
us O
cruelly O
. O

So O
, O
for O
example O
, O
on O
one O
occasion O
the O
men B-TER
tried O
to O
get O
some O
dry O
wood O
and O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
having O
noticed O
it O
, O
beat B-TER
them O
up O
brutally O
. O

They O
cut O
the O
hair O
of O
many O
girls B-TER
completely O
; O
the O
women B-TER
were O
stripped B-TER
naked I-TER
and O
men B-TER
bared O
their O
heads O
. O

They O
lined O
everybody O
up O
already O
on O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

We O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
look O
back O
; O
they O
threw O
stones O
at O
those O
who O
did O
. O

It O
was O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
who O
did O
all O
of O
this O
. O

They O
beat O
up O
even O
those O
who O
could O
not O
jump O
up O
from O
the O
stool O
when O
a O
gendarme B-TER
came O
by O
. O

No O
complaint O
was O
taken O
against O
the O
work O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
council I-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
a O
communal B-TER
kitchen I-TER
, O
but O
those O
who O
ran O
out O
of O
supplies O
were O
given O
uncooked O
food B-TER
. O

After O
five O
weeks O
we O
were O
always O
told O
that O
we O
would O
go O
to O
work B-TER
on O
Transdanubia B-LOC
, O
more O
precisely O
all O
the O
men B-TER
would O
. O

Before O
the O
deportation B-TER
they O
had O
taken O
away O
all O
our O
papers O
in O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
they O
searched O
us O
and O
entrained O
us O
. O

They O
crammed O
80 O
people O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

They O
gave O
us O
some O
water O
and O
a O
bucket O
for O
a O
toilet O
too O
. O

Nobody O
died B-TER
in O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
and O
nobody O
escaped B-TER
from O
it O
either O
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
over O
us O
in O
Kassa B-LOC
we O
understood O
the O
situation O
already O
. O

After O
a O
three O
- O
day O
- O
long O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
7th O
May O
. O

We O
were O
still O
in O
the O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
when O
Polish B-TER
prisoners B-TER
dressed B-TER
in I-TER
striped I-TER
clothes I-TER
told O
us O
to O
get O
off O
and O
leave O
all O
our O
baggage O
there O
. O

After O
that O
they O
lined O
us O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
five O
and O
formed O
groups O
of O
us O
, O
one O
of O
which O
was O
sent B-TER
on O
the O
left O
, O
the O
other O
on O
the O
right O
hand O
side O
. O

They O
took O
us O
in O
the O
bathhouse O
and O
stripped O
us O
; O
they O
gave O
us O
grey O
prisoner‘s B-TER
clothes B-TER
and O
sent O
us O
to O
Camp B-TER
B. O
700 O
of O
us O
were O
put O
in O
a O
block O
, O
12 O
of O
us O
on O
a O
bunk B-TER
. O

Our O
provisions O
were O
the O
well O
- O
known O
camp B-TER
provisions B-TER
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
for O
hours O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
a O
warehouse O
of O
clothes B-TER
; O
we O
were O
the O
ones O
to O
dress O
the O
transports B-TER
. O

We O
took O
off O
the O
shoes O
of O
those O
who O
were O
selected B-TER
out O
from O
Camp B-TER
C I-TER
and O
if O
a O
person O
showed O
obstinacy O
or O
insisted O
on O
his O
shoes B-TER
very O
much O
we O
had O
to O
hit O
him O
, O
because O
if O
we O
did O
not O
, O
we O
were O
beaten O
up O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
day O
and O
night O
shifts O
; O
the O
transports B-TER
came O
to O
be O
dressed O
at O
night O
, O
but O
even O
from O
those O
transports B-TER
the O
weaker O
people O
were O
picked O
up O
and O
lined O
up O
naked O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O

There O
was O
a O
strict O
block O
curfew O
when O
the O
transports B-TER
were O
selected B-TER
; O
we O
had O
to O
switch O
off O
the O
light O
and O
trucks O
came O
from O
the O
crematorium B-TER
on O
which O
the O
naked O
people O
were O
put O
. O

We O
worked O
some O
metres O
away O
from O
the O
crematorium B-TER
; O
from O
there O
we O
saw O
as O
the O
trucks O
were O
turned O
over O
and O
people O
were O
spilt O
from O
them O
to O
the O
burning O
pit O
like O
bags O
of O
potatoes O
. O

We O
often O
heard O
shouting O
, O
crying O
and O
moaning O
especially O
at O
night O
, O
when O
the O
voices O
reached O
us O
more O
easily O
, O
but O
we O
also O
saw O
fires O
and O
flames O
frequently O
. O

When O
a O
transport B-TER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
arrived O
in O
September O
they O
took O
away O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
together O
. O

They O
led O
them O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
in O
groups O
of O
five O
. O

In O
September O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
traffic O
there O
anyway O
; O
transports B-TER
came O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
from O
other O
camps B-TER
too O
and O
those O
people O
were O
also O
quickly O
thrown O
into O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

There O
were O
transports B-TER
coming O
from O
Slovakia B-LOC
still O
in O
November O
; O
these O
were O
not O
killed B-TER
by O
gas B-TER
but O
the O
mothers B-TER
with O
their O
small O
children B-TER
were O
sent O
away O
and O
older O
boys O
and O
men B-TER
were O
assigned O
to O
do O
some O
work O
. O

In O
November O
, O
the O
crematorium B-TER
was O
dismantled O
; O
we O
also O
worked O
there O
for O
a O
week O
. O

They O
wanted O
every O
sign O
of O
the O
crematorium B-TER
to O
disappear O
: O
even O
the O
bricks O
were O
carried O
away O
. O

In O
December O
, O
we O
were O
put O
in O
a O
transport B-TER
as O
well O
and O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Hundsfeld B-LOC
near O
Brezlau B-LOC
. O

It O
took O
us O
one O
day O
to O
get O
there O
. O

We O
did O
somewhat O
better O
there O
, O
since O
it O
was O
a O
little O
camp B-TER
and O
the O
factory B-TER
provided O
us O
with O
food B-TER
, O
so O
the O
provisions B-TER
were O
naturally O
better O
. O

Although O
we O
stayed O
there O
only O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
, O
as O
the O
Russian B-ORG
troops I-ORG
were O
approaching O
, O
they O
formed O
a O
transport B-TER
from O
us O
again O
and O
sent O
us O
to O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
. O

The O
march B-TER
lasted O
for O
three O
days O
since O
it O
was O
January O
; O
there O
was O
a O
great O
snowstorm O
and O
it O
was O
terribly O
cold O
. O

We O
had O
to O
push O
big O
carts O
in O
which O
we O
were O
taking O
the O
belongings O
of O
the O
overseers B-TER
. O

One O
night O
we O
slept O
in O
a O
chamber O
; O
the O
ill B-TER
and O
weak O
people B-TER
were O
taken O
after O
us O
on O
trucks O
, O
but O
we O
heard O
that O
some O
of O
them O
were O
taken O
off O
the O
truck O
to O
be O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

They O
were O
buried O
right O
there O
in O
the O
snow O
. O

We O
had O
to O
help O
the O
ill B-TER
people O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
. O

We O
were O
very O
weak O
, O
we O
had O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
and O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
pull O
the O
carts O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
ill B-TER
people O
’s O
cart O
there O
, O
so O
we O
left O
the O
ill B-TER
and O
we O
were O
being O
chased O
along O
. O

We O
were O
so O
exhausted O
already O
that O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
go O
any O
further O
; O
we O
would O
not O
have O
minded O
if O
they O
had O
shot O
us O
dead O
immediately O
. O

At O
last O
they O
took O
pity O
on O
us O
and O
, O
since O
we O
were O
not O
far O
away O
from O
our O
destination O
, O
they O
had O
the O
carts O
pulled O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
by O
horses O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
women I-TER
shot B-TER
down I-TER
those O
women B-TER
who O
collapsed O
from O
weakness O
with O
bone O
chilling O
coolness O
. O

1,200 O
people O
started O
with O
the O
transport B-TER
, O
but O
by O
the O
time O
we O
arrived O
our O
number O
had O
been O
reduced O
to O
700 O
. O

The O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
camp B-TER
was O
only O
for O
men B-TER
; O
there O
we O
received O
clothes B-TER
and O
we O
had O
a O
rest O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
we O
continued O
our O
journey O
to O
Mauthausen B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
took O
us O
to O
a O
bath O
for O
men B-TER
, O
male O
prisoners B-TER
disinfected O
us O
, O
then O
we O
were O
given O
a O
pair O
of O
long O
underpants B-TER
and O
a O
shirt B-TER
. O

There O
were O
no O
women B-TER
’s O
clothes B-TER
there O
. O

After O
three O
days O
we O
got O
our O
disinfected O
clothes B-TER
back O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
the O
Russians B-ORG
came O
closer O
and O
there O
was O
no O
time O
to O
give O
everybody O
her O
own O
clothes B-TER
. O

We O
picked O
up O
the O
clothes O
at O
random O
and O
so O
we O
ran O
away O
like O
that O
, O
dressed B-TER
improperly O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
ten O
days O
later O
. O

On O
the O
way O
we O
lived O
on O
a O
little O
amount O
of O
food B-TER
that O
we O
had O
managed O
to O
bring O
with O
us O
. O

Several O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
reached O
us O
on O
the O
way O
, O
but O
many O
of O
us O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
too O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
for O
three O
months O
. O

It O
was O
a O
collecting O
camp B-TER
and O
everybody O
was O
taken O
there O
from O
before O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

1,200 O
of O
us O
were O
crammed O
in O
a O
block O
. O

We O
slept B-TER
on O
the O
ground O
in O
filth O
and O
lice O
; O
we O
did O
not O
have O
blankets O
. O

We O
were O
given O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
twice O
a O
day O
and O
a O
thin O
slice O
of O
bread B-TER
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

At O
the O
end O
we O
did O
not O
even O
see O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
weeks O
. O

We O
worked O
in O
the O
kitchen O
18 O
- O
20 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
so O
we O
sometimes O
managed O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
raw O
carrots B-TER
. O

The O
English B-ORG
troops I-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
15th O
April O
and O
soon O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
. O

They O
accommodated B-TER
us O
in O
a O
garrison O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

There O
we O
had O
a O
good O
place O
, O
nice O
treatment O
and O
proper O
provisions B-TER
. O

The O
ill B-TER
people O
received O
medical O
treatment O
. O

From O
there O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Celle B-LOC
, O
then O
with O
a O
Czech B-TER
transport O
we O
came O
home O
. O

Two O
men B-TER
were O
assigned O
to O
escort O
us O
in O
Pozsony B-LOC
, O
thus O
we O
came O
home O
through O
Komárom B-LOC
. O

Our O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
we O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine B-LOC
soon O
. O
