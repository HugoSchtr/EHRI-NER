Eli B-PER
Rozenberg I-PER
, O
born O
in O
1924 O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
at O
25 B-LOC
Gęsia I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

My O
father O
was O
murdered B-TER
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
1940 O
. O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
I O
was O
deported B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
along O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
, O
we O
were O
packed O
100 O
to O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

When O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
, O
it O
was O
already O
dawn O
I O
saw O
the O
Małkinia B-LOC
station O
through O
the O
little O
barred O
window O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
detaching O
groups O
of O
15 O
wagons B-TER
that O
went O
on O
a O
special O
side O
- O
track O
leading O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
when O
the O
wagons B-TER
stopped O
, O
they O
started O
shouting O
raus O
, O
raus O
. O

Women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
were O
separate B-TER
, O
saying O
good O
- O
bye O
to O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
to O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
side O
, O
where O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
sit B-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
ground I-TER
, O
telling O
us O
that O
the O
baths B-TER
are O
here O
and O
that O
when O
we O
are O
bathed O
then O
everyone O
would O
be O
reunited O
with O
their O
family O
, O
would O
get O
new O
clothing B-TER
and O
we O
would O
travel O
on O
further O
to O
where O
we O
would O
be O
working B-TER
. O

At O
this O
point O
a O
German B-TER
ran O
up O
to O
us O
as O
we O
were O
sitting B-TER
on O
the O
ground O
, O
picking B-TER
out I-TER
30 O
boys O
and O
me O
, O
telling O
us O
that O
we O
are O
going O
off O
to O
work B-TER
, O
happy O
that O
I O
would O
see O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
again O
, O
we O
took O
us O
to O
a O
big O
yard B-TER
where O
there O
were O
huge O
piles O
of O
clothing B-TER
, O
suitcases O
, O
men O
’s O
and O
women O
’s O
shoes O
, O
baggage O
, O
money B-TER
, O
and O
mounds O
of O
other O
things O
, O
then O
the O
German B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
take O
off O
our O
coats O
and O
start O
working B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
consisted O
of O
sorting B-TER
every O
thing O
: O
shoes O
with O
shoes O
, O
coats O
with O
cots O
, O
etc O
. O

Not O
knowing O
anything O
about O
what O
was O
going O
on O
there O
, O
I O
asked O
a O
few O
boys O
, O
but O
no O
one O
gave O
me O
a O
real O
answer O
, O
I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
we O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
talk B-TER
to O
each O
other O
, O
suddenly O
I O
recognized O
someone O
I O
knew O
who O
used O
to O
live O
in O
one O
of O
the O
buildings O
in O
our O
courtyard O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
away O
4 O
days O
before O
I O
was O
, O
so O
having O
asked O
him O
what O
this O
was O
here O
and O
where O
all O
the O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
were O
, O
he O
turned O
away O
, O
and O
with O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
he O
told O
me O
just O
one O
word O
: O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
mother O
or O
sister O
any O
more O
. O

Before O
he O
managed O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
happened O
to O
them O
and O
how O
, O
2 O
Germans B-TER
ran O
up O
to O
us O
and O
started O
to O
thrash O
us O
in O
the O
head O
with O
whips B-TER
, O
then O
an O
additional O
25 O
blows O
on O
our O
bare O
bodies B-TER
. O

I O
got O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
with O
great O
difficulty O
, O
after O
we O
sorted B-TER
things O
for O
another O
2 O
hours O
until O
10 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
they O
herded O
us O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
suddenly O
they O
started O
shouting O
in O
German O
: O
they O
stabbed B-TER
Maks B-PER
SS‑Unterscharführer O
Max O
Bialas O
was O
killed O
on O
September O
10 O
or O
11 O
, O
1942 O
by O
Meir O
Berliner O
, O
a O
prisoner O
. O

As O
retaliation O
, O
the O
Germans O
killed O
160 O
prisoners O
. O

with O
a O
knife O
, O
who O
then O
was O
dying O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
then O
they O
started O
to O
shoot B-TER
at O
us O
and O
torture B-TER
us O
mercilessly O
, O
with O
whatever O
they O
could O
. O

We O
pushed O
against O
each O
other O
like O
sheep O
, O
and O
when O
I O
fell O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
I O
was O
hit B-TER
on O
the O
fingers O
with O
a O
bayonet O
. O

After O
an O
hour O
of O
being O
chased O
like O
that O
, O
they O
killed B-TER
100 O
boys O
, O
including O
the O
hero O
[ O
who O
had O
stabbed O
Max B-PER
] O
, O
and O
chased O
us O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
that O
I O
managed O
to O
rip O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
shirt B-TER
off O
to O
bandage O
my O
hand O
, O
each O
one O
of O
us O
laid O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
crying O
and O
in O
pain B-TER
, O
to O
rest O
a O
little O
. O

The O
boys O
who O
had O
already O
been O
there O
for O
a O
few O
days O
or O
weeks O
already O
knew O
that O
we O
had O
to O
get B-TER
up I-TER
when O
the O
light O
was O
still O
grayish O
outside O
and O
wait O
until O
they O
open O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
did O
n’t O
open O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
they O
only O
threatened B-TER
us O
with O
machine O
guns O
and O
said O
that O
they O
would O
all O
kill O
us O
in O
a O
minute O
, O
so O
waiting O
impatiently O
for O
death B-TER
. O

They O
opened O
the O
barracks B-TER
only O
at O
11 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
shouting O
alles O
raus O
, O
they O
put O
us O
in O
rows O
and O
took O
200 O
boys B-TER
away O
, O
shot B-TER
them O
with O
a O
machine O
gun O
and O
herded O
the O
rest O
to O
work B-TER
, O
punishing B-TER
them O
for O
3 O
days O
by O
giving O
them O
no O
food B-TER
or O
water O
. O

In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
a O
German B-TER
came O
to O
the O
group O
that O
was O
sorting B-TER
shoes O
and O
took O
50 O
boys O
away O
including O
me O
, O
telling O
us O
that O
we O
were O
only O
going O
to O
do O
some O
light O
work B-TER
for O
10 O
minutes O
, O
and O
took O
us O
through O
the O
whole O
yard O
to O
some O
gate O
, O
and O
when O
we O
went O
through O
that O
gate O
my O
blood O
froze O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
heap O
of O
dead O
people B-TER
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
bloodied O
boys O
going O
up O
to O
them O
with O
stretchers O
, O
grabbing O
corpses B-TER
by O
the O
hands O
and O
legs O
, O
they O
laid O
them O
on O
the O
stretcher O
and O
ran O
away O
with O
them O
, O
thinking O
about O
all O
of O
this O
, O
I O
looked O
on O
with O
tears O
in O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
felt O
a O
blow O
to O
my O
head O
with O
a O
riding O
crop O
, O
the O
boys O
who O
were O
already O
there O
for O
a O
few O
days O
told O
us O
that O
two O
boys O
should O
take O
a O
stretcher O
and O
carry B-TER
corpses B-TER
to O
the O
pit O
, O
I O
went O
quickly O
to O
the O
stretcher O
, O
and O
taking O
the O
stretcher O
back O
, O
we O
went O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
they O
hit O
us O
with O
whips B-TER
, O
shouting O
: O
faster O
, O
you O
dogs O
. O

I O
ran O
to O
the O
ramp O
quickly O
, O
we O
put O
the O
stretcher O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
clumsily O
laid O
the O
corpse B-TER
onto O
the O
stretcher O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
the O
Germans B-TER
began O
to O
torture B-TER
us O
mercilessly O
, O
they O
threw O
me O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
head O
, O
shouting O
that O
I O
had O
n’t O
picked O
up O
the O
corpse B-TER
the O
right O
way O
, O
that O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
pick O
them O
up O
by O
the O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
lay O
them O
down O
evenly O
on O
the O
stretcher O
. O

I O
got O
up O
off O
the O
ground O
with O
difficulty O
and O
taking O
the O
stretcher O
with O
my O
friend O
, O
we O
ran O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
pit B-TER
, O
on O
the O
way O
to O
the O
pit B-TER
boys O
were O
running O
with O
corpses B-TER
, O
on O
after O
another O
, O
and O
coming O
closer O
to O
the O
pit B-TER
I O
saw O
another O
tragic O
scene O
, O
in O
the O
pit B-TER
I O
saw O
only O
a O
huge O
puddle O
of O
blood O
and O
when O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
pit B-TER
, O
they O
sunk O
into O
the O
blood O
, O
I O
carried O
corpses B-TER
for O
a O
whole O
month O
, O
then O
they O
moved O
me O
to O
the O
ramp O
, O
that O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
, O
pulling O
out O
gassed B-TER
corpses B-TER
. O

I O
pulled O
out O
corpses B-TER
for O
5 O
months O
, O
all O
of O
those O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
pits B-TER
and O
spread O
with O
chlorine O
, O
in O
1943 O
, O
in O
February O
, O
the O
order O
was O
issued O
to O
dig O
out O
all O
those O
corpses B-TER
and O
burn B-TER
them O
, O
so O
3 O
diggers B-TER
were O
brought O
in O
that O
lowered O
their O
buckets O
into O
the O
pit B-TER
and O
grabbed O
the O
pieces O
of O
flesh O
and O
bones O
with O
their O
teeth O
and O
then O
threw O
them O
onto O
the O
ground O
above O
, O
boys O
standing O
nearby O
with O
pitchforks O
put O
the O
pieces O
of O
flesh O
and O
bones O
on O
stretchers O
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
fire O
, O
burning B-TER
8 O
thousand O
people O
a O
day O
