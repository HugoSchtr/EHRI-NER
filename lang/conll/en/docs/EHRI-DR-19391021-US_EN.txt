It O
would O
seem O
, O
from O
all O
indications O
, O
that O
the O
intent O
is O
to O
obtain O
a O
large O
group O
of O
workers B-TER
for O
use O
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

What O
this O
use O
is O
seems O
to O
be O
problematical O
, O
but O
it O
may O
well O
be O
to O
prepare O
a O
place O
for O
the O
permanent O
settlement B-TER
of O
the O
families B-TER
, O
etc O
. O

, O
of O
these O
men B-TER
. O

It O
would O
seem O
that O
this O
movement O
may O
well O
be O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
movement O
of O
populations O
which O
the O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
are O
carrying O
out O
, O
including O
the O
bringing O
back O
of O
German B-TER
families B-TER
from O
the O
Baltic O
States O
, O
Russia B-LOC
, O
and O
those O
parts O
of O
Poland B-LOC
recently O
occupied O
by O
Russia B-LOC
. O

There O
are O
many O
rumors B-TER
, O
but O
to O
date O
unverified O
, O
that O
the O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
intend O
to O
bring O
into O
Bohemia B-TER
and I-TER
Moravia I-TER
many O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
who O
are O
being O
evacuated B-TER
from O
others O
sections O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
including O
some O
of O
those O
who O
are O
leaving O
the O
country O
near O
the O
German B-LOC
- O
Frenche B-LOC
French O
war O
zone O
. O

If O
these O
rumors B-TER
are O
warranted O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
the O
plan O
to O
replace B-TER
some O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
populations I-TER
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
and I-LOC
Moravia I-LOC
by O
German B-TER
populations O
