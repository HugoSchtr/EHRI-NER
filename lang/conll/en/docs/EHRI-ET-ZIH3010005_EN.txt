. O

It O
was O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
so O
called O
Aussiedlung O
. O

The O
transporting B-TER
of O
Jews O
out O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
had O
been O
continuing O
for O
two O
months O
already O
. O

Around O
half O
past O
four O
in O
the O
afternoon O
a O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
officers I-TER
and O
Ukrainians B-TER
arrived O
at O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
ordered O
everyone O
to O
go O
outside O
into O
the O
yard O
and O
from O
there O

200 O
persons O
, O
women B-TER

The O

We O
travelled O
in O
crowded O
conditions O
until O
seven O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

The O
journey O
was O
horrible O
because O
the O
thirst B-TER
drove O
us O
simply O
to O
madness O
, O
sweat O
was O
dripping O
from O
us O
because O
of O
the O
heat B-TER

In O

, O
at O
the O

station O
, O
the O

was O
divided O
into O
three O
parts O
of O
20 O

and O
20 O
cars B-TER
were O
sent O

a O
railway O

The O
train B-TER
stopped O
by O
a O
platform O
, O
there O
were O
two O
barracks O
next O
to O
it O
. O

Not O

from O
the O
barracks O
there O
was O
a O
yard O
fenced O
with O

The O
whole O

and O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
had O
barbed O

fences O
, O
usually O
with O
wire O
- O
poles O
and O
also O
a O

- O
net O
over O
them O
. O

On O
the O
platform O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
of O
previous O
transports B-TER
, O
80 O
men B-TER
, O
waited O
for O
us O
. O

40 O
men B-TER
worked B-TER
on O
the O
platform O
, O
that O
is O
, O
they O
opened O
the O
cars B-TER
, O
told O
the O
people O
to O
get O
out O
, O
removed O
the O
bodies B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
dead I-TER
from O
the O
cars B-TER
and O
cleaned O
up O
the O
railway O
in O
general O
. O

This O
group O
carried O
blue O
bands O
on O
their O
left O
arm O
and O
were O
called O
Blau O
Kommando O
. O

The O
other O
40 O
men B-TER
worked B-TER
in O
the O
yard O
, O
where O
the O
transport B-TER
was O
sent O
in O
order O
to O
undress B-TER
themselves O
. O

They O
carried O
red O
armbands O
. O

During O
all O
this O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
would O
come O
and O
beat O
us O
murderously O
with O
whips O
and O
sticks O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
yard O
the O
unit O
with O
the O
red O
armbands O
called O
out O
that O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
left O
and O
men B-TER
to O
the O
right O
. O

The O
women B-TER
then O
went O
to O
the O
left O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
barrack O
, O
and O
the O
men B-TER
to O
the O
right O
to O
another O
barrack O
, O
where O
everyone O
was O
made O
to O
stand O
in O
lines O
. O

The O
Rot O
Kommando O
then O
shouted O
to O
the O
women B-TER
to O
remove O
their O
shoes B-TER
and O
tie O
them O
up O
securely O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
string O
. O

Those O
who O
did O
n’t O
have O
any O
string O
were O
given O
some O
. O

Then O
the O
women B-TER
were O
allowed O
to O
enter O
into O
the O
barrack O
: O
at O
the O
entrance O
the O
shoes O
were O
tied O
together O
and O
put O
aside O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
did O
not O
happen O
without O
the O
savage O
beatings O
. O

There O
was O
one O
German B-TER
from O
Frankfurt B-LOC
among O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
his O
name O
was O
Sepp B-PER
Hitreider I-PER
. O

He O
was O
especially O
active O
in O
mistreating O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
he O
once O
said O
something O
to O
a O
child B-TER
and O
the O
child B-TER
did O
not O
understood O
him O
, O
he O
grabbed O
the O
child B-TER
by O
the O
little O
legs O
and O
threw O
him O
against O
the O
wall O
smashing O
his O
head O
. O

He O
would O
give O
a O
kick O
a O
pregnant O
woman B-TER
to O
her O
belly O
so O
she O
would O
immediately O
[ O
.. O
? O
] O
or O
simply O
fall O
dead B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
, O
so O
that O
there O
were O
many O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
around O
the O
barracks O
. O

Women B-TER
were O
so O
gravely O
injured O
that O
they O
were O
being O
unable O
to O
walk O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bath O
. O

In O
the O
barrack O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
Rot O
Kommando O
told O
the O
women B-TER
to O
dress B-TER
down I-TER
naked O
. O

The O
undressing B-TER
did O
not O
happen O
without O
the O
murderous O
beatings O
. O

When O
a O
part O
of O
the O
women B-TER
understood O
what O
was O
happening O
, O
they O
started O
to O
wail O
. O

Then O
a O
German B-TER
came O
in O
and O
held O
a O
speech O
, O
telling O
them O
not O
to O
be O
afraid O
, O
nothing O
bad O
would O
not O
happen O
to O
anyone O
, O
the O
women B-TER
would O
only O
be O
bathed O
and O
then O
receive O
new O
clothes B-TER
and O
leave O
for O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
occasion O
he O
also O
announced O
that O
all O
the O
documents O
and O
gold O
jewelry O
had O
to O
be O
deposited O
at O
a O
cashier O
’s O
and O
that O
these O
things O
would O
be O
given O
back O
later O
. O

The O
women B-TER
were O
then O
sent O
to O
a O
hairdresser O
, O
where O
their O
hair O
was O
shaved O
short O
. O

( O
By O
the O
way O
, O
the O
hair O
was O
later O
picked O
up O
, O
disinfected O
and O
sent O
away O
in O
freight O
cars O
. O

) O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
men B-TER
were O
ordered O
to O
undress B-TER
completely O
, O
only O
holding O
their O
shoes O
, O
documents O
and O
valuables O
in O
their O
hands O
. O

While O
undressing B-TER
, O
the O
unfortunate O
were O
murderously O
and O
sadistically O
beaten O
, O
especially O
by O
a O
certain O
Kurt B-PER
Franz I-PER
from O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
the O
vice O
commander O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
who O
set O
his O
dog O
Bari O
on O
the O
unfortunate O
ones O
and O
their O
skin O
was O
being O
torn O
away O
. O

After O
leaving O
their O
shoes O
on O
the O
ground O
there O
, O
the O
men B-TER
were O
led O
to O
a O
side O
alley O
, O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
called O
Himmelgasse O
. O

The O
men B-TER
had O
to O
run O
all O
the O
way O
, O
about O
300 O
metres O
. O

This O
way O
led O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
alley O
there O
was O
a O
cashier O
’s O
booth O
, O
where O
all O
things O
had O
to O
be O
left O
. O

A O
Jew O
, O
also O
a O
victim B-TER
, O
had O
to O
select O
20 O
- O
30 O
men B-TER
that O
were O
in O
the O
best O
health O
from O
among O
the O
running O
ones O
. O

They O
were O
stopped O
and O
made O
to O
carry O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
transport B-TER
that O
had O
just O
arrived O
to O
a O
designated O
place O
. O

This O
group O
was O
beaten O
especially O
savagely O
. O

The O
dog O
was O
tearing O
away O
pieces O
of O
flesh O
, O
they O
were O
beaten O
with O
shovels O
and O
metal O
rods O
. O

After O
finishing O
the O
work O
that O
was O
assigned O
to O
them O
, O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
alley O
. O

I O
want O
to O
add O
that O
the O
unfortunate O
ones O
were O
thirsty O
and O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
drink O
. O

Water O
was O
available O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Ukrainians B-TER
guarded O
the O
pumps O
and O
did O
not O
permit O
to O
swallow O
even O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
ones O
begged O
them O
: O
A O
little O
water O
and O
then O
you O
can O
shoot O
us O
. O

Right O
after O
the O
men B-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
were O
brought O
. O

When O
the O
alley O
ended O
, O
a O
building O
appeared O
before O
the O
eyes O
, O
it O
was O
partly O
made O
of O
stone O
and O
partly O
of O
wood O
, O
of O
a O
beautiful O
style O
, O
with O
flowers O
around O
a O
huge O
star O
of O
David O
on O
the O
roof O
. O

People O
were O
brought O
into O
this O
building O
when O
they O
had O
to O
take O
the O
so O
- O
called O
bath O
. O

Before O
entering O
the O
building O
, O
a O
group O
of O
Ukrainians B-TER
would O
usually O
wait O
for O
them O
. O

One O
of O
them O
especially O
stood O
out O
from O
the O
others O
. O

His O
specialty O
was O
torturing O
women B-TER
, O
whose O
breasts O
or O
ears O
he O
would O
cut O
off O
, O
or O
very O
often O
rape B-TER
them O
in O
front O
of O
everybody O
. O

There O
was O
no O
end O
to O
the O
wailing O
and O
the O
shouting O
. O

The O
door O
opened O
and O
about O
800 O
persons O
were O
pushed O
inside O
the O
chamber B-TER
, O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
separately O
. O

They O
were O
pushed O
inside O
with O
their O
hands O
up O
in O
the O
air O
, O
so O
that O
more O
would O
fit O
in O
. O

The O
murders B-TER
jabbed O
at O
the O
backs O
with O
bayonets O
, O
and O
after O
filling O
up O
the O
chamber B-TER
there O
was O
no O
space O
for O
even O
a O
pin O
. O

With O
a O
special O
machine O
, O
the O
air O
from O
the O
building O
was O
sucked O
out O
and O
the O
building O
was O
hermetically O
closed O
, O
and O
a O
car O
engine O
with O
gas B-TER
was O
started O
. O

The O
engine O
worked O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
. O

After O
10 O
minutes O
, O
a O
specially O
designated O
unit O
of O
Jews O
opened O
the O
chamber B-TER
, O
and O
a O
mass O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
appeared O
, O
their O
stood O
in O
the O
same O
position O
as O
when O
they O
were O
pushed O
inside O
. O

The O
Jewish O
unit O
removed O
the O
bodies B-TER
and O
carried O
them O
to O
the O
special O
pits B-TER
that O
were O
ready O
, O
as O
deep O
as O
a O
two O
- O
storey O
building O
and O
more O
, O
and O
there O
the O
bodies B-TER
were O
laid O
in O
layers O
one O
on O
the O
other O
. O

After O
every O
transport B-TER
, O
the O
layer O
was O
covered O
with O
sand O
, O
and O
when O
the O
pit B-TER
was O
full O
, O
chlorine O
was O
poured O
on O
and O
it O
was O
covered O
. O

After O
a O
certain O
time O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
, O
the O
burning B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
cadavers I-TER
started O
. O

Sort O
of O
grates O
from O
iron O
railings O
were O
constructed O
, O
wood O
was O
placed O
under O
them O
and O
the O
bodies B-TER
were I-TER
burned I-TER
. O

The O
content O
from O
the O
long O
- O
ago O
overfilled O
pits B-TER
was O
removed O
by O
special O
machines O
and O
placed O
next O
to O
the O
pits B-TER
. O

The O
specially O
designated O
Jews O
had O
to O
sift O
through O
the O
sand O
with O
their O
bare O
hands O
, O
collect O
all O
the O
flesh B-TER
and I-TER
bones I-TER
aside O
and O
carry O
it O
on O
stretchers O
in O
order O
to O
be O
burned B-TER
. O

A O
death O
punishment O
awaited O
those O
who O
would O
miss O
a O
smallest O
bone B-TER
in O
sand O
. O

The O
informant O
tells O
that O
he O
was O
a O
member O
of O
a O
worker O
unit O
that O
sorted O
through O
clothes B-TER
and O
did O
different O
other O
jobs O
. O

He O
spent O
11 O
months O
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
. O

The O
worker O
unit O
stayed O
alive O
for O
so O
long O
for O
a O
certain O
reason O
, O
that O
is O
, O
because O
one O
time O
, O
a O
transport B-TER
with O
Jews O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
arrived O
, O
a O
group O
of O
200 O
persons O
were O
selected O
and O
tortured O
horribly O
. O

A O
certain O
German B-TER
called O
Max B-PER
Biela I-PER
took O
a O
special O
part O
in O
this O
sadism O
. O

A O
Jew O
from O
the O
transport B-TER
ran O
to O
this O
German B-TER
and O
stuck O
a O
knife O
to O
his O
back O
, O
killing B-TER
him O
. O

As O
a O
punishment O
, O
around O
150 O
workers O
from O
the O
unit O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

The O
following O
day O
, O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
Stangl B-PER
decided O
that O
in O
order O
not O
to O
repeat O
the O
experience O
of O
selecting O
new O
workers O
, O
the O
unit O
that O
was O
already O
working O
and O
comprised O
700 O
- O
1000 O
persons O
should O
for O
the O
time O
being O
stay O
for O
a O
longer O
period O
. O

In O
July O
1943 O
a O
group O
of O
workers O
started O
to O
organize O
an O
uprising B-TER
in O
order O
to O
destroy O
the O
death B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
to O
escape B-TER
afterwards O
. O

We O
stole O
guns O
and O
ammunition O
in O
sacks O
and O
hid O
it O
. O

While O
we O
were O
carrying O
the O
weapons O
, O
the O
workers O
were O
cleaning O
water O
basins O
pounding O
them O
violently O
on O
purpose O
in O
order O
to O
make O
a O
great O
noise O
– O
the O
Germans B-TER
moved O
further O
away O
from O
the O
barracks O
and O
we O
used O
the O
opportunity O
. O

On O
the O
2nd O
of O
August O
1943 O
, O
at O
4.15 O
PM O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
signal O
, O
a O
revolver O
shot O
, O
the O
uprising B-TER
broke O
out O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Jews O
set O
the O
petrol O
reserves O
on O
fire O
with O
grenades O
and O
then O
burned O
down O
the O
barracks O
and O
the O
fence O
. O

A O
considerable O
part O
of O
Ukrainians B-TER
defended O
themselves O
and O
