Just O
like O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
, O
a O
number O
of O
special O
provisions B-TER
apply O
to O
Jews B-TER
in O
Ostland B-TER

These O
Regulations O
are O
only O
to O
a O
very O
limited O
extent O
drawn O
up O
by O
the O
administrative B-TER
Authorities I-TER

Thus O
, O
only O
a O
single O
related O
regulation O
is O
seen O
to O
have O
been O
issued O
by O
the O
Minister B-ORG

State I-ORG
for I-ORG

, O
see O
below O

B.VIII O
, O
and O
the O
Office O
of O
the O
Commissioner O
of O
the O
Interior O
essentially O
confines O
himself O
to O
an O
Order O
of O
13 O
October O
of O
the O
previous O
year O
, O
regarding O
the O
Treatment O
of O
Jewish B-TER
Wealth I-TER
in O
the O
State O
Commission O
of O
Ostland B-TER
. O

The O
Area O
Commissioners O
or O
the O
Self- O
Government B-TER
administrative O
Authorities O
have O
drafted O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
provisions O
, O
and O
many O
of O
these O
Provisions O
are O
hardly O
published O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
regulations B-TER
in O
question O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
access O
for O
the O
legation O
, O
and O
there O
may O
also O
be O
some O
minor O
differences O
in O
the O
rules O
at O
the O
various O
locations O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
the O
legation O
will O
refer O
to O
some O
of O
the O
special B-TER
provisions I-TER
applicable O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Ostland B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
the O
foregoing O
, O
it O
is O
not O
certain O
that O
all O
the O
rules O
made O
under O
B. O
IV O
to O
VII O
apply O
throughout O
Ostland B-TER
. O

However O
, O
the O
envoy O
has O
intended O
to O
refrain O
from O
conducting O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
they O
are O
applicable O
everywhere O
, O
as O
their O
applicability O
in O
most O
places O
is O
undoubted O
, O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
more O
the O
general O
principles O
which O
have O
been O
adopted O
by O
the O
authorities B-TER
. O

The O
following O
draws O
upon O
some O
of O
the O
Special B-TER
Provisions I-TER
of O
Interest O
. O

A. O
So O
far O
there O
is O
no O
provision B-TER
for O
what O
is O
meant O
by O
the O
term O
' O
Jew B-TER
' O
. O

However O
, O
one O
would O
assume O
that O
the O
rules O
of O
this O
term O
in O
Ostland B-TER
, O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
ones B-TER
used O
in O
Germany B-TER
