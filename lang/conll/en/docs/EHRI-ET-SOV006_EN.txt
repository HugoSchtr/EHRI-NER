the O
horror O
in O

I O
will O
focus O
on O
the O
last O
camp B-LOC
– O
in O
Minsk B-LOC
. O

The O
camp B-LOC
was O
located O
in O
Komarovska B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
Moscow B-LOC
highway O
. O

It O
was O
in O
a O
not O

five O
- O
story O
house O
. O

More O
than O
5000 O
prisoners B-TER
of O

When O

– O
approximately O
1000 O
men B-TER

, O
we O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
a O

We O
were O

some O

of O
roasted B-TER

. O

Bread B-TER
was O
not O

In O

it O

October O
after O

One O
time O
, O
someone O
yelled O
food O
. O

Everyone O
ran O
outside O
without O
extinguishing O
the O

and O
the O
stable O

. O

They O

The O
commander O
counted O
off O
100 O
men B-TER
. O

They O
were O
immediately O
shot B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

Everyone O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
, O
because O
the O
inhabitants O
used O
to O
slip O
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
to O
us O
. O

There O
were O
too O
many O
claimants O
for O
work B-TER
. O

The O
sentries O
used O
to O
beat O
us O
with O
sticks O
of O
rubber O
and O
shot B-TER
at O
us O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
they O
used O
to O
kill B-TER
between O
30 O
and O
40 O
men B-TER
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
started O
to O
get O
sick B-TER
with I-TER
dysentery I-TER
. O

Whenever O
we O
went O
outside O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
shooting B-TER
. O

In O
the O
mornings O
, O
we O
used O
to O
find O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
murdered B-TER
. O

When O
they O
used O
to O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
, O
they O
used O
to O
kill B-TER
for O
any O
reason O
: O
if O
you O
said O
a O
word O
to O
a O
friend O
or O
if O
someone O
of O
the O
weakened O
prisoners B-TER
halted O

a O
minute O
. O

From O
the O

station O
to O
Komarovska B-LOC
, O
one O
could O
see O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
murdered B-TER
prisoners B-TER
. O

One O
time O
, O
they O
brought O
prisoners B-TER
from O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
Novgorod B-LOC
- I-LOC
Siverskyi I-LOC
. O

From O
2000 O
men B-TER

total O
only O
300 O
made O
it O
to O
Minsk B-LOC

the O

Many O

after O
arrival O
in O
Minsk B-LOC
. O

Two O
days O
in O
a O
row O
, O
we O
buried B-TER
them O
. O

Then O
, O
an O
epidemic B-TER
of I-TER
typhus I-TER
broke O
out O
. O

Every O
day O
, O
around O
200 O
prisoners B-TER
died B-TER
. O

All O
those O
who O
could O
still O
move O
a O
little O
, O
used O
to O
carry O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
out O
to O
the O
park O
. O

We O
were O
not O
able O
to O
bury B-TER
them O
, O
though O
– O
the O
soil O
was O
frozen O
through O
and O
through O
. O

We O
piled O
them O
up O
. O

When O
spring O
was O
approaching O
, O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
started O
to O
decay O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
the O
general O
commissar O
of O
Belarus B-LOC
commanded O
that O
the O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
were O
to O
be O
doused O
with O
fuel O
and O
burned B-TER
. O

I O
survived O
by O
mere O
accident O
– O
I O
do O
n’t O
look O
like O
a O
Jew O
. O

The O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
were O
usually O
stripped O
naked O
, O
they O
usually O
got O
beaten O
, O
killed B-TER

Afterwards O
, O
they O
would O
be O
thrown O
into O
a O
basement O
where O
water O
reached O
over O
their O
knees O
. O

After O
three O
days O
, O
they O
were O
dragged O
out O
of O
there O
and O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
many O
Jews O
remained O
– O
old O
people O
and O
women B-TER
with O
children B-TER
who O
had O
not O
managed O
to O
evacuate O

There O

The O

Old O

The O

Into O
the O

the O
murdered B-TER
used O
to O
fall O
as O
well O
as O
wounded O
ones O
, O
those O
barely O
alive O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
pits B-TER
were O
covered O
with O

. O

Such O
massacres B-TER
usually O
took O
place O
once O
per O

, O
definitely O
around O
Shabes O

The O

gathered O
together O
in O
one O
go O

There O
were O
more O

their I-TER
heads I-TER

The O
whole O
city B-LOC

in O
a O
state O
of O
anxiety O
, O
in O
the O
deep O
darkness O
of O
these O
unprecedented O
massacres B-TER
. O

Through O
the O
summer O
of O
1942 O

the O
Germans B-TER
