Interview O
with O
Miss O

The O
interview O
took O
place O
on O
3.11.1954 O
, O
partly O
in O
English B-LOC
, O
partly O
in O
German B-LOC
. O

Miss O
X O
was O
born O
at O
Breslau B-LOC
in O
June O
1923 O
. O

Her O
father B-TER
is O
Jewish O
, O
her O
mother B-TER
Aryan O
. O

Her O
parents B-TER
separated O
, O
for O
purely O
private O
reasons O
, O
in O
1930 O
and O
were O
divorced O
in O
1934 O
. O

Miss O
stayed O
with O
her O
mother B-TER
who O
, O
shortly O
afterwards O
, O
married B-TER
an O
Aryan O

Mr. O
Krimke B-PER
emigrated B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
in O
1938 O

Miss O
Krimke B-PER
joined O
her O
father B-TER
there O
after O
the O
war B-TER
. O

Miss O
X O
First O
of O
all O
I O
should O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
in O
some O
respects O
my O
story O
is O
not O
a O
typical O
one O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
living O
in O
an O
entirely O
non O
- O
Jewish O
household O
, O
am O
of O
Nordic O
appearance O
, O
and O
was O
converted B-TER
in O
June O
1933 O
from O
my O
father B-TER
’s I-TER
Jewish O
to O
my O
mother B-TER
’s I-TER
Protestant B-TER
faith B-TER
probably O
saved O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
unpleasantness O
. O

Neither O
my O
father B-TER
nor O
my O
mother B-TER
are O
strict O
in O
their O
respective O
religions B-TER
, O
and O
my O
early O
religious B-TER
upbringing O
had O
been O
correspondingly O
liberal O
; O
so O
that O
the O
conversion B-TER
itself O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
remember O
, O
made O
little O
impression O
on O
me O
. O

The O
practical O
significance O
, O
however O
, O
became O
soon O
apparent O
: O
At O
that O
time O
I O
attended O
a O
private O
school B-TER
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
Jewish O
pupils O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
1933 O
the O
classes B-TER
were O
separated O
into O
a O
Christian B-TER
and O
a O
Jewish O
section O
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
not O
on O
official O
orders B-TER
, O
but O
the O
initiative O
of O
the O
Headmaster O
. O

I O
was O
at O
first O
put O
into O
the O
Jewish O
section O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
was O
made O
to O
realize O
the O
problem O
of O
my O
part B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
parentage O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
that O
I O
was O
very O
upset O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
protested O
to O
the O
Headmaster O
, O
and O
I O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Christian B-TER
section O
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
incident O
, O
my O
school B-TER
- I-TER
life I-TER
was O
quite O
happy O
when O
I O
was O
twelve O
I O
changed O
over O
to O
a O
Lyzeum O
. O

The O
school B-TER
kept O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
to O
its O
liberal O
traditions O
. O

The O
teachers O
showed O
no O
discrimination B-TER
against O
me O
, O
although O
they O
all O
learned O
sooner O
or O
later O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
my O
work B-TER
was O
seriously O
affected O
by O
worry B-TER
about O
my O
father B-TER
in O
London B-LOC
, O
my O
Latin O
mistress O
went O
out O
of O
her O
way O
to O
be O
sympathetic O
and O
helpful O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
master O
who O
evidenced O
animosity O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
this O
was O
from O
racial B-TER
prejudice I-TER
. O

In O
such O
lessons O
as O
German B-LOC
, O
history O
and O
geography O
we O
were O
taught O
an O
exaggerated O
patriotism O
rather O
than O
specifically O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
doctrines O
. O

I O
can O
not O
recall O
any O
direct O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
observations O
Jewish O
achievements O
were O
simply O
not O
mentioned O
. O

The O
names O
of O
Spinoza O
, O
Ehrlich O
, O
Offenbach O
and O
Einstein O
- O
to O
gave O
but O
a O
few O
examples O
- O
were O
unknown O
to O
me O
until O
I O
came O
to O
England B-LOC
after O
the O
war B-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
only O
non O
- O
Aryan O
in O
my O
class B-TER
. O

There O
were O
some O
other O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
girls O
in O
the O
school B-TER
and O
I O
learnt O
from O
hearsay O
that O
their O
position O
was O
sometimes O
difficult O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
was O
always O
on O
excellent O
terms O
with O
my O
class O
- O
mates O
. O

My O
class B-TER
may O
have O
been O
exceptional O
in O
that O
it O
contained O
not O
a O
single O
ardent O
Nazi O
. O

At O
first O
my O
fellow O
pupils O
did O
not O
know O
of O
being O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

When O
somebody O
told O
them O
they O
decided O
, O
as O
I O
learnt O
later O
, O
to O
hide O
their O
knowledge O
from O
me O
in O
order O
to O
spare O
me O
any O
embarrassment O
. O

We O
were O
altogether O
not O
greatly O
interested O
in O
politics B-TER
. O

I O
passed O
my O
Abitur O
in O
1941 O
, O
the O
last O
year O
when O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
I O
was O
faced O
with O
my O
first O
real O
difficulties O
. O

Politics B-TER
had O
entered O
into O
my O
home O
life O
earlier O
and O
more O
forcefully O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
was O
a O
violent O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Nazi I-TER
. O

She O
talked O
very O
freely O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
constant O
fear O
that O
she O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
. O

My O
step B-TER
- I-TER
father I-TER
was O
a O
Nazi O
of O
the O
idealistic O
type O
, O
who O
expected O
wonderful O
things O
of O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
. O

There O
were O
frequent O
and O
sometimes O
rather O
violent O
political O
arguments O
between O
him O
and O
my O
mother B-TER
. O

About O
Jews O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
strong O
feelings O
either O
for O
and O
against O
, O
and O
he O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
if O
were O
his O
own O
daughter O
. O

He O
had O
been O
a O
Party B-TER
member I-TER
, O
but O
although O
he O
had O
been O
told O
that O
the O
Party B-TER
would O
not O
object O
to O
his O
marrying B-TER
the O
former O
wife O
of O
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
mother B-TER
of O
a O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
child B-TER
, O
he O
was O
afterwards O
put O
under O
pressure O
to O
leave O
the O
Party B-TER
. O

My O
presence O
caused O
a O
number O
of O
problems O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
. O

I O
particularly O
remember O
the O
problem O
of O
ration O
stamps O
: O
As O
a O
rule O
, O
ration B-TER
stamps O
were O
distributed O
into O
the O
households O
by O
the O
street O
warden O
; O
but O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
had O
to O
collect O
them O
personally O
from O
a O
special O
Centre O
. O

This O
applied O
also O
to O
every O
member O
of O
a O
household O
which O
contained O
a O
non- O
Aryan B-TER
. O

To O
be O
seen O
regularly O
at O
this O
Centre O
for O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
would O
have O
gravely O
endangered O
my O
step B-TER
- I-TER
father I-TER
’s I-TER
position O
in O
the O
firm B-TER
which O
employed B-TER
him O
. O

He O
finally O
managed O
to O
obtain O
dispensation O
from O
the O
rule B-TER
, O
but O
we O
were O
still O
obliged O
to O
collect O
our O
ration B-TER
stamps O
from O
the O
Food B-TER
Office O
direct O
, O
and O
were O
not O
granted O
occasional O
extra O
rations B-TER
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
. O

This O
and O
similar O
difficulties O
are O
trifling O
in O
retrospect O
, O
but O
seemed O
very O
important O
at O
the O
time O
and O
made O
me O
disturbingly O
aware O
of O
my O
inferior O
status O
in O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
. O

This O
feeling O
increased O
with O
the O
problems O
which O
arose O
on O
my O
leaving O
school B-TER
. O

I O
had O
set O
my O
heart O
on O
a O
University B-TER
education B-TER
, O
but O
one O
could O
not O
be O
enrolled O
at O
a O
Univerity B-TER
before O
having O
completed O
the O
six O
months O
’s O
Labour B-TER
Service I-TER
( O
Arbeitsdienst O
) O
, O
from O
which O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
excluded O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
had O
to O
complete O
a O
Year O
of O
Duty O
( O
Pflichtjahr O
at O
some O
place O
where O
there O
was O
urgent O
need O
for O
a O
servant O
, O
as O
in O
families B-TER
with O
many O
children B-TER
. O

In O
my O
first O
service O
of O
this O
kind O
I O
did O
not O
mention O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
; O
when O
my O
employer B-TER
was O
informed O
of O
it O
, O
I O
was O
dismissed B-TER
. O

I O
finished O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
Protestant B-TER
cleric B-TER
, O
Kirchenrätin O
Viebig O
. O

She O
was O
markedly O
pro O
- O
Jewish O
, O
keeping O
up O
contact O
, O
at O
great O
risk O
to O
herself O
, O
with O
her O
Jewish O
friends O
until O
these O
were O
deported B-TER
. O

I O
was O
treated O
more O
as O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
house B-TER
than O
as O
a O
servant O
. O

During O
that O
time O
9 O
made O
several O
further O
application O
for O
admittance O
into O
the O
Labour B-TER
Service I-TER
. O

I O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
suggest O
that O
I O
was O
the O
illegitimate O
child B-TER
of O
an O
Aryan O
father B-TER
. O

I O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O

I O
felt O
very O
bitter O
about O
the O
whole O
situation O
in O
a O
quite O
childishly O
self O
- O
centred O
way O
. O

I O
blamed O
my O
mother B-TER
for O
having O
married B-TER
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
several O
times O
even O
told O
her O
so O
to O
her O
face O
. O

It O
was O
not O
that O
I O
experienced O
any O
conflict O
of O
loyalties O
or O
felt O
tainted O
by O
my O
Jewish O
blood O
. O

I O
simply O
resented O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
under O
a O
special O
handicap O
; O
most O
of O
all O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
start O
a O
career O
to O
which O
I O
felt O
my O
talents O
and O
education B-TER
entitled O
me O
. O

Inconsistently O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O
did O
not O
affect O
feelings O
towards O
my O
father B-TER
. O

I O
had O
always O
been O
on O
most O
affectionate O
terms O
with O
him O
. O

From O
the O
time O
when O
my O
parents O
separated O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
his O
emigration B-TER
I O
had O
visited O
him O
regularly O
. O

Shortly O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
I O
spent O
a O
holidays O
with O
him O
in O
London B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
considered O
for O
a O
while O
joining O
him O
there O
permanently O
. O

All O
through O
the O
war B-TER
I O
tried O
to O
obtain O
news O
from O
him O
though O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

My O
social O
relations O
with O
other O
young O
people O
were O
less O
problematic O
than O
the O
official O
discrimination B-TER
against O
non O
- O
Aryans O
would O
lead O
one O
to O
expect O
. O

None O
of O
my O
old O
friends O
changed O
her O
or O
his O
attitude O
. O

Whenever O
I O
met O
a O
young O
man B-TER
who O
seemed O
to O
take O
an O
illegible O
interest O
in O
me O
I O
told O
him O
at O
once O
that O
I O
was O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
. O

I O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
special O
implications O
. O

I O
considered O
such O
firendships O
and O
flirtations O
as O
proof O
that O
my O
personal O
attractions O
were O
stronger O
than O
the O
influence O
of O
official O
disapproval O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
I O
found O
that O
at O
least O
in O
the O
circles O
in O
which O
I O
moved O
the O
younger O
generation O
took O
Nazi B-TER
doctrines I-TER
far O
less O
seriously O
than O
their O
elders O
. O

The O
interest O
of O
my O
friends O
was O
mainly O
limited O
to O
their O
personal O
affairs O
; O
they O
were O
rather O
cynical O
in O
their O
attitude O
to O
politics B-TER
and O
the O
war B-TER
. O

The O
one O
exception O
I O
remember O
was O
, O
curiously O
enough O
, O
a O
Czech B-LOC
with O
whom O
I O
formed O
a O
serious O
attachment O
. O

He O
had O
pronounced O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
feeling O
, O
and O
at O
first O
I O
could O
not O
find O
the O
moral O
courage O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
my O
father B-TER
was O
Jewish O
. O

When O
I O
told O
him O
eventually O
, O
he O
got O
over O
the O
shock O
after O
having O
wrestled O
with O
the O
problem O
, O
as O
he O
told O
me O
, O
for O
a O
whole O
sleepless O
night O
. O

Our O
friendship O
continued O
, O
and O
at O
one O
stage O
we O
seriously O
considered O
marrying B-TER
. O

This O
brought O
home B-TER
to O
me O
the O
paradox O
of O
my O
position O
in O
regard O
to O
marriage B-TER
: O
as O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
I O
could O
marry B-TER
neither O
a O
Jew O
nor O
an O
Aryan O
without O
special O
permission O
; O
and O
as O
a O
German B-LOC
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
marry B-TER
, O
or O
have O
intimate O
relations O
with O
, O
a O
man B-TER
of O
inferior O
foreign B-TER
nationality I-TER
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
frequently O
warned O
that O
I O
had O
been O
seen O
in O
the O
company O
of O
this O
Czech B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
this O
might O
get O
me O
into O
trouble O
. O

It O
did O
not O
come O
to O
a O
formal O
application O
for O
permission O
to O
marry B-TER
, O
but O
once O
I O
made O
a O
general O
enquiry O
as O
to O
my O
chances O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
marry B-TER
an O
Aryan O
. O

The O
official O
in O
charge O
of O
non O
- O
Aryan O
affairs O
in O
Breslau B-LOC
told O
me O
that O
my O
chances O
were O
fairly O
good O
, O
since O
neither O
my O
father B-TER
himself O
nor O
a O
member O
of O
his O
family B-TER
had O
received O
a O
University B-TER
education B-TER
; O
thus O
there O
was O
little O
risk O
of O
my O
transmitting O
Jewish O
intelligence O
to O
my O
children B-TER
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
I O
learnt O
that O
a O
strict O
watch O
was O
kept O
on O
all O
non O
- O
Aryans O
. O

The O
official O
knew O
practically O
everything O
about O
my O
family B-TER
affairs O
, O
work B-TER
, O
friendships O
etc O
. O

After O
the O
completion O
of O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
I O
found O
it O
difficult O
, O
as O
a O
half B-TER
- I-TER
Jewess I-TER
, O
to O
find O
suitable O
employment B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
finish O
a O
course O
in O
shorthand O
- O
typing O
at O
the O
[ O
Städtische O
Handelsschule O
] O
. O

I O
had O
to O
leave O
a O
congenial O
position O
as O
shop B-TER
assistant I-TER
in O
a O
music O
shop O
, O
because O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
forbidden O
employment B-TER
which O
would O
bring O
them O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
general O
public O
. O

I O
applied O
for O
a O
job B-TER
in O
a O
factory B-TER
owned O
by O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
my O
father B-TER
's I-TER
. O

At O
first O
he O
did O
not O
dare O
take O
me O
on O
because O
, O
having O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
wife O
, O
he O
was O
himself O
in O
a O
delicate O
position O
. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
him O
a O
little O
later O
through O
the O
official O
employment B-TER
exchange O
, O
he O
engaged O
me O
as O
a O
typist B-TER
. O

I O
had O
no O
difficulties O
with O
my O
fellow B-TER
- I-TER
workers I-TER
in O
the O
office O
. O

In O
August O
1944 O
I O
was O
drafted O
into O
a O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
, O
Unternehmen O
Berthold O
, O
about O
20 O
miles O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

We O
numbered O
approximately O
150 O
girls B-TER
, O
for O
the O
greater O
part O
children B-TER
of O
mixed O
marriages B-TER
, O
like O
myself O
( O
though O
there O
were O
also O
some O
Aryan O
and O
a O
few O
Jewesses O
who O
somehow O
had O
escaped B-TER
arrest B-TER
and O
deportation B-TER
before O
them O
) O
. O

divided O
into O
5 O
groups O
. O

Some O
Nordic O
-looking O
girls B-TER
, O
including O
myself O
, O
were O
picked O
out O
to O
be O
group O
leaders O
. O

We O
were O
made O
to O
dig O
fortifications O
, O
but O
supervision O
was O
rather O
lax O
and O
we O
did O
not O
overwork O
ourselves O
. O

Our O
accommodation B-TER
, O
first O
in O
a O
barn B-TER
, O
later O
on O
the O
dance O
floor O
of O
a O
country O
inn B-TER
, O
was O
primitive O
, O
the O
food B-TER
bad O
and O
insufficient O
, O
and O
the O
sanitary B-TER
arrangements O
shocking O
. O

Our O
guards O
, O
uniformed B-TER
members O
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
were O
unpleasant O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
physical O
violence B-TER
. O

Frequent O
beatings B-TER
, O
however O
, O
occurred O
in O
the O
men B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
near O
- O
by O
, O
as O
we O
learnt O
from O
the O
men B-TER
when O
we O
met O
them O
at O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
daily O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
were O
perfunctory O
, O
and O
some O
of O
us O
went O
several O
times O
secretly O
to O
Breslau B-LOC
for O
a O
day O
. O

We O
did O
not O
try O
to O
escape B-TER
altogether O
, O
as O
we O
feared O
that O
reprisals O
would O
be O
taken O
against O
those O
left O
behind O
. O

Almost O
from O
the O
beginning O
we O
developed O
a O
strong O
spirit O
of O
solidarity O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
acquired O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
positive O
attitude O
towards O
the O
Jewish O
part O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Previously O
I O
had O
felt O
the O
kind O
of O
Jewish O
antisemitism O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
was O
often O
found O
in O
some O
sections O
of O
German B-LOC
Jewry O
. O

This O
feeling O
I O
lost O
completely O
through O
the O
intimate O
contact O
with O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
, O
some O
of O
whom O
had O
physically O
and O
mentally O
strong O
Jewish O
characteristics O
. O

Without O
that O
experience O
, O
I O
doubt O
that O
later O
on O
I O
would O
have O
made O
the O
decision O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
and O
live O
with O
my O
father B-TER
. O

Some O
girls B-TER
- O
very O
few O
- O
tried O
to O
curry O
favour O
with O
the O
guards B-TER
and O
slept O
with O
them O
. O

They O
were O
boycotted O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
. O

Their O
behaviour O
was O
considered O
treacherous O
. O

There O
was O
no O
objection O
to O
sexual B-TER
misbehaviour O
, O
as O
such O
including O
Lesbian B-TER
practices O
, O
of O
which O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
outlook O
on O
sexual B-TER
behaviour O
amongst O
my O
contemporaries O
had O
become O
completely O
cynical O
under O
the O
Nazi O
regime O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
war B-TER
. O

When O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
the O
Russian B-ORG
army I-ORG
had O
advanced O
to O
within O
hearing O
distance O
of O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
I O
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
girls B-TER
made O
our O
escape B-TER
. O

This O
was O
not O
difficult O
, O
as O
by O
that O
time O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
already O
demoralised O
and O
hardly O
tried O
to O
maintain O
control O
. O
