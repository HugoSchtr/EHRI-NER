“ O
I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
considerable O
controversy O
has O
followed O
the O
introduction O
into O
Parliament B-ORG
of O
the O
new O
Jew B-TER
Bill B-TER
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
and O
the O
Gentile B-TER
press B-TER
came O
to O
grips O
over O
it O
. O

The O
former O
printed O
articles O
by O
prominent O
Gentile B-TER
Hungarians B-TER
, O
many O
of O
the O
aristocracy O
, O
advancing O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
Bill B-TER
was O
contrary O
to O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity B-TER
, O
violated O
the O
Constitution O
, O
and O
was O
inhumane O
. O

The O
Gentile B-TER
press B-TER
stressed O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
to O
assimilate O
, O
their O
practicing O
a O
doctrine O
of O
race O
defense O
, O
their O
inferior O
outlook O
on O
life O
, O
and O
their O
failure O
to O
accept O
the O
general O
principles O
of O
Christian B-TER
morals O
, O
and O
it O
was O
predicted O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
would O
attempt O
sabotage B-TER
to O
vitiate O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
Bill B-TER
. O

Protests B-TER
against O
the O
Bill B-TER
were O
expressed O
in O
sermons B-TER
delivered O
in O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
synagogues B-TER
. O

Many O
see O
in O
the O
presenting O
of O
this O
drastic O
bill B-TER
a O
clever O
move O
by O
Imrédy B-PER
to O
steal O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
National I-ORG
Socialists I-ORG
, O
to O
produce O
per O
se O
a O
revulsion O
to O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
sentiment O
( O
because O
in O
wide O
circles O
it O
is O
considered O
un- O
Hungarian B-TER
and O
unfair O
) O
, O
and O
to O
make O
Hungary B-LOC
unattractive O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
neighboring O
countries O
who O
would O
flee B-TER
to O
it O
as O
a O
haven O
from O
persecution B-TER
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
the O
last O
analysis O
, O
many O
responsible O
Hungarians B-TER
are O
wondering O
what O
will O
become O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
especially O
the O
poorer O
ones O
, O
when O
they O
are O
deprived B-TER
of B-TER
their I-TER
means I-TER
of I-TER
livelihood I-TER
. O

They O
feel O
that O
the O
Government B-TER
is O
making O
a O
huge O
problem O
for O
itself O
by O
accelerating O
this O
problem O
without O
sufficient O
preparation O
. O

The O
German B-TER
Minister I-TER
told O
me O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
possible O
for O
the O
Hungarians B-TER
to O
carry O
on O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
policy B-TER
as O
they O
conceived O
it O
because O
, O
unlike O
Germany B-TER
, O
there O
were O
no O
skilled O
Gentiles B-TER
to O
replace O
the O
Jews B-TER
. O
