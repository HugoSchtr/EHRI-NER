the O
following O
report O
on O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
Generalgouvernement B-TER
General O

: O
“ O
After O
the O
latest O
air B-TER
- I-TER
raids I-TER
by O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
, O
the O
town O
appears O
very O
much O
damaged B-TER
. O

It O
is O
estimated O
that O
the O
German B-ORG
bombings I-ORG
, O
when O
Warsaw O
was O
conquered O
, O
damaged O
15 O
- O
20 O
% O
of O
the O
buildings O
, O
and O
the O
damage O
inflicted O
by O
the O
Bolsheviks O
is O
estimated O
to O
be O
the O
same O
. O

This O
means O
that O
30 O
- O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
buildings O
are O
almost O
totally O
destroyed O
, O
every O

In O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
a O
vast O
area O
right O
in O
the O
centre B-LOC
of I-LOC
town I-LOC
and O
separated B-TER
from O
it O
only O
by O
a O
high O
wall O
built O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
when O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
requested O
that O
a O
few O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
should O
be O
sent O
out O
to O
work B-TER
in O
factories O
, O
the O
Jews O
refused O
to O
obey O
the O
order B-TER
, O
saying O
that O
they O
had O
not O
heard O
again O
from O
the O
Jews O
that O
had O
previously O
left B-TER
the I-TER
ghetto I-TER
, O
As O
we O
know O
, O
a B-TER
war I-TER
ensued O
that O
is O
still O
continuing O
. O

On O
the O
one O
side O
the B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
of O
whom O
there O
are O
still O
perhaps O
about O
15,000 O
and O
who O
have O
dug O
themselves O
in O
inside O
the O
ghetto O
, O
building O
underground O
bunkers O
up O
to O
thirty O
meters O
deep O
, O
powerfully B-TER
armoured I-TER
and O
equipped O
with O
heavy O
and O
light O
machine O
guns O
, O
who O
are O
supported O
and O
led O
by O
Bolsheviks B-TER
sent O
from O
Moscow B-LOC
, O
and O
have O
huge O
stockpiles O
of O
food O
and O
ammunition O
that O
could O
last O
them O
for O
years O
of O
fighting O
. O

On O
the O
other O
, O
SS B-ORG
units O
who O
systematically O
and O
without O
needlessly O
endangering O
the O
lives O
of O
their O
soldiers O
advance O
from O
house O
to O
house O
, O
following O
even O
the O
sewers O
and O
the O
underground O
canals O
where O
fighting O
goes O
on O
, O
and O
subdue O
resistance B-TER
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
Chief O
told O
me O
that O
he O
expects O
to O
subdue B-TER
all I-TER
resistance I-TER
within O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

In O
this O
climate O
, O
while O
the O
population O
is O
being O
bombarded O
from O
the O
sky O
, O
mined O
underground O
by O
the O
fighting B-TER
within O
the O
ghetto O
and O
by O
the O
ghetto O
’s O
emissaries B-TER
( O
Communists B-TER
and O
Jews O
who O
have O
managed O
to O
leave O
the O
ghetto O
and O
are O
hiding O
in O
town O
) O
and O
forced O
on O
the O
ground O
to O
rely O
on O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
to O
survive O
among O
all O
kinds O
of O
threats O
, O
secret B-TER
organizations I-TER
of O
Communists O
and O
Jews O
flourish O
, O
as O
well O
as O
others O
by O
Polish O
nationalists O
, O
both O
of O
which O
try O
to O
prepare O
the O
revolt O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
want O
to O
cause O
terror O
among O
the O
ruling O
group O
. O

The O
organizers O
warn O
the O
German B-TER
rulers I-TER
and O
those O
Poles B-LOC
that O
are O
believed O
to O
sympathize B-TER
with O
them O
that O
they O
will O
be O
liquidated B-TER
, O
and O
every O
day O
there O
are O
murders O
taking O
place O
in O
circumstances O
worthy O
of O
a O
crime O
thriller O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
Gestapo O
chiefs O
and O
Nazi B-ORG
party I-ORG
leaders O
, O
always O
in O
civilian O
clothes O
, O
going O
around O
with O
their O
revolver O
at O
the O
ready O
. O

I O
have O
noticed O
that O
when O
they O
have O
to O
go O
somewhere O
, O
they O
resort O
to O
stratagems O
to O
mislead O
those O
who O
might O
be O
following O
them O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
During O
my O
stay O
in O
Warsaw O
I O
have O
contacted O
local O
leaders O
of O
the O
General O
Governorate O
, O
of O
the O
Nazi O
party O
, O
of O
the O
Gestapo O
, O
of O
Russian O
and O
Polish O
circles O
close O
to O
the O
German B-TER
occupying I-TER
authorities I-TER
. O

[ O
… O
] O
These O
same O
people O
suggest O
that O
a O
solution O
might O
be O
found O
by O
transforming O
the O
struggle O
, O
which O
right O
now O
has O
taken O
on O
the O
character O
of O
an O
exclusively O
German O
struggle O
against O
Russia B-LOC
, O
thus O
endowing O
Stalin B-PER
with O
a O
pedestal O
as O
Russia O
’s O
saviour B-TER
, O
and O
having O
it O
revert O
, O
as O
the O
Duce B-PER
had O
suggested O
, O
to O
its O
true O
essence O
: O
the O
struggle O
of O
Europe O
, O
led O
by O
the O
Axis B-TER
, O
against O
Bolshevism O
. O

For O
this O
struggle O
one O
could O
rely O
on O
the O
organization O
of O
some O
millions O
of O
Russians O
who O
would O
fight O
even O
more O
fanatically O
than O
Axis B-TER
troops O
against O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
to O
free O
their O
fatherland O
from O
Bolshevism B-TER
. O

To O
this O
Russia B-LOC
military O
organization O
, O
the O
armed O
forces O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
ought O
to O
provide O
the O
structure O
and O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
reserves O
. O

To O
make O
the O
military O
struggle O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
against O
Bolshevism B-TER
feasible O
in O
this O
manner O
one O
would O
have O
to O
establish O
, O
as O
a O
fundamental O
prerequisite O
, O
the O
political B-TER
conditions I-TER
for O
the O
cooperation O
of O
all O
anti O
- O
Bolshevik O
Polish O
and O
Russia B-LOC
peoples O
on O
a O
political O
platform O
that O
might O
look O
like O
this O
: O
Russia O
to O
the O
Russia B-LOC
– O
Poland B-LOC
to O
the O
Poles O
, O
both O
obviously O
under O
the O
control B-TER
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
powers O
and O
their O
allies O
; O
war B-TER
against O
Bolshevism B-TER
; O
war B-TER
against I-TER
Jews I-TER
