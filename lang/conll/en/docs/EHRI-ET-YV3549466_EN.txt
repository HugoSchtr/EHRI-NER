The O
testimony B-TER
of O
Ernestine B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
is O
of O
particular O
relevance O
, O
because O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
reports B-TER
about O
a O
camp O
beyond O
the O
river O
Bug O
, O
and O
apart O
from O
that O
because O
it O
confirms O
and O
complements O
another O
report B-TER
. O

So O
far O
it O
was O
only O
known O
from O
the O
first O
letter B-TER
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
from O
November O
10 O
, O
1955 O
that O
there O
is O
a O
book B-TER
by O
Arnold B-PER
Daghani I-PER
( O
Korn O
) O
, O
which O
deals O
with O
the O
camp B-LOC
Tarasivka I-LOC
and O
also O
contains O
sections O
about O
the O
son B-PER
of O
Mrs. B-PER
Rosengarten I-PER
. O

We O
had O
tried O
in O
vain O
so O
far O
to O
obtain O
it O
for O
the O
library B-TER
, O
because O
Dr. B-PER
Weinstein I-PER
, O
who O
is O
mentioned O
in O
the O
letter B-TER
as O
the O
owner O
of O
a O
Romanian B-LOC
copy O
, O
once O
lent O
it O
to O
someone O
and O
does O
not O
remember O
to O
whom O
and O
did O
not O
get O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
library B-TER
has O
so O
far O
also O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
obtain O
an O
English B-LOC
copy O
through O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
World I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
said O
to O
have O
helped O
to O
publish O
an O
English B-LOC
edition O
at O
that O
time O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

– O
As O
a O
result O
, O
we O
then O
put O
a O
search O
note O
in O
the O
newspaper B-TER
of O
the O
Bukovina B-LOC
Jews O
in O
Israel B-LOC
Die O
Stimme O
, O
and O
subsequently O
Dr. B-PER
Fischer I-PER
, O
who O
works O
at O
the O
URO B-ORG
in O
Tel B-LOC
Aviv I-LOC
, O
lent O
a O
Romanian B-LOC
copy O
to O
the O
library B-TER
. O

However O
, O
- O
2 O
- O
I O
myself O
have O
not O
yet O
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
take O
note O
of O
the O
content O
, O
as O
it O
has O
been O
lent O
for O
scientific O
work O
. O

– O
Furthermore O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
my O
trip O
to O
Europe B-LOC
I O
became O
aware O
of O
another O
report B-TER
on O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
located O
at O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
and O
whose O
author O
is O
a O
Mr. O
Segall B-PER
probably O
Nathan O
Segall O
, O
murdered O
in O
Tarasivka O
1943 O
, O
who O
wrote O
this O
report B-TER
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
. O

An O
accompanying O
report B-TER
by O
another O
author O
, O
who O
is O
not O
mentioned O
, O
shows O
that O
Segall B-PER
wrote O
this O
report B-TER
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
, O
whereto O
he O
traveled O
from O
Tarasivka B-LOC
in O
the O
company O
of O
an O
SS B-ORG
man O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man O
then O
continued O
to O
Bukovina B-LOC
and O
Romania B-LOC
to O
seek O
help B-TER
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
and O
later O
Segall B-PER
returned O
there O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
man O
, O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
accompanying O
report B-TER
, O
died O
there O
during O
the O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
on O
December O
13 O
, O
1943 O
. O

As O
I O
heard O
from O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
this O
Segall B-PER
report B-TER
to O
Yad B-ORG
Vashem I-ORG
with O
the O
next O
shipment O
of O
testimonies B-TER
is O
imminent O
. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
author O
of O
the O
accompanying O
report B-TER
is O
not O
given O
, O
and O
must O
not O
yet O
be O
given O
by O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
, O
because O
he O
himself O
intends O
to O
publish O
it O
. O

- O
It O
is O
now O
very O
interesting O
that O
this O
SS B-ORG
Lieutenant O
Elsässer B-PER
, O
who O
visited O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
according O
to O
the O
report B-TER
of O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
and O
provided O
help B-TER
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
is O
the O
same O
who O
had O
previously O
been O
in O
Mogilev B-LOC
and O
about O
whom O
the O
Wiener B-ORG
Library I-ORG
has O
the O
mentioned O
report B-TER
, O
because O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
told O
me O
in O
the O
course O
of O
her O
testimony B-TER
that O
Elsässer B-PER
first O
went O
to O
Mogilev B-LOC
with O
a O
Jew O
named O
Segall B-PER
, O
but O
could O
not O
take O
him O
further O
, O
and O
then O
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
alone O
with O
a O
sergeant O
. O

So O
one O
report B-TER
confirms O
the O
other O
! O
There O
are O
some O
more O
details O
to O
note O
about O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
’s I-PER
statement B-TER
: O
the O
assumption O
of O
Mrs. O
Rosengarten B-PER
that O
Elsässer B-PER
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Todt B-ORG
organization I-ORG
and O
the O
camp B-LOC
- O
3 O
- O
is O
not O
very O
likely O
, O
because O
in O
general O
these O
functions O
were O
separate O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
whole O
action O
of O
Elsässer B-PER
and O
his O
behavior O
is O
something O
unique O
. O

There O
is O
no O
other O
case O
known O
that O
a O
German B-LOC
SS B-ORG
man O
or O
officer O
undertook O
such O
a O
journey O
, O
which O
was O
apparently O
officially O
approved O
or O
at O
least O
permitted O
. O

According O
to O
the O
descriptions B-TER
of O
Mrs. O
R. B-PER
and O
also O
of O
Segall B-PER
he O
also O
seems O
to O
have O
really O
wanted O
to O
help B-TER
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
and O
not O
to O
make O
money O
for O
the O
SS B-ORG
or O
to O
go O
raiding B-TER
. O

It O
would O
be O
worth O
considering O
whether O
one O
should O
try O
to O
determine O
if O
he O
survived O
the O
war B-TER
and O
to O
contact O
him O
. O

In O

of O
November O

to O
Yad B-ORG
Vashem I-ORG
, O
I O
already O

my O

fate O
. O

In O
summary O
of O
this O
information O
and O
for O
further O
details O
, O
I O
report B-TER
: O
My O
son B-PER
and O
his O
wife B-TER
Anni B-PER
( I-PER
Hanna I-PER
) I-PER
were O
taken O
out O
of O
their O
home O
in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
on O
June O
14 O
, O
1942 O
and O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
Laidzin I-LOC
probably O
Ladyzhin O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
. O

From O
there O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
across O
the O
river O
Bug B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
they O
came O
through O
Bershad B-LOC
from O
there O
we O
received O
a O
postcard O
with O
a O
greeting O
. O

My O
son B-PER
was O
an O
excellent O
engineer O
, O
and O
beyond O
the O
river O
Bug B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
were O
probably O
in O
different O
camps B-TER
, O
at O
least O
in O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
Organisation B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
( O
as O
all O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
did O
handwritten O
addition O
) O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
or O
end O
of O
October O
1943 O
, O
a O
senior O
lieutenant O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
with O
a O
sergeant O
from O
Tarasivka B-LOC
to O
collect O
donations O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
. O

He O
lodged O
with O
the O
grammar O
school O
professor O
Schwarz B-PER
, O
the O
father B-TER
of O
my O
daughter B-PER
- I-PER
in I-PER
- I-PER
law I-PER
, O
he O
brought O
a O
general O
letter B-TER
( O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
... O
crossed O
out O
in O
the O
original O
) O
from O
my O
son B-PER
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
in O
which O
he O
asked O
for O
help B-TER
for O
all O
Jews O
in O
Tarasivka B-LOC
, O
and O
a O
second O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
to O
us O
. O

Everything O
I O
report B-TER
in O
the O
following O
is O
based O
on O
this O
lieutenant O
’s O
statements B-TER
. O

His O
name O
was O
Elsässer B-PER
, O
in O
civilian O
life O
he O
was O
a O
contractor O
and O
came O
from O
Cologne B-LOC
. O

He O
came O
at O
the O
instigation O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
Tarasivka B-LOC
camp I-LOC
to O
fetch O
gifts O
for O
them O
. O

On O
his O
departure O
from O
- O
5 O
- O
Tarasivka B-LOC
with O
the O
sergeant O
he O
took O
two O
Jews O
with O
him O
, O
my O
son B-PER
and O
another O
one O
called O
Segall B-PER
. O

But O
my O
son B-PER
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Bug B-LOC
and O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
any O
further O
. O

The O
other O
one O
, O
Segall B-PER
, O
accompanied O
him O
to O
Mogilev B-LOC
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
he O
also O
had O
to O
stay O
. O

The O
lieutenant O
and O
the O
sergeant O
continued O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
Elsässer B-PER
was O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
group O
of O
the O
organization B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
, O
which O
was O
building O
roads O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
-controlled O
area O
beyond O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

Since O
he O
was O
powerful O
, O
I O
assume O
that O
he O
coincidentally O
was O
the O
leader O
of O
the O
camp B-LOC
Tarasivka I-LOC
, O
too O
. O

It O
was O
not O
only O
Jews B-TER
coming O
from O
Transnistria B-LOC
working B-TER
there O
but O
also O
two O
other O
groups O
, O
i.e. O
not O
only O
Bukovina B-LOC
Jews O
, O
but O
also O
Ukrainian B-LOC
Jews O
. O

Jews O
who O
came O
from O
Ukraine B-LOC
( O
Transnistria B-LOC
) O
, O
and O
Polish B-LOC
Jews O
. O

But O
in O
total O
there O
were O
only O
300 O
people O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
enclosed O
letter B-TER
by O
my O
son B-PER
. O

Elsässer B-PER
brought O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
the O
Jews O
in O
T. B-LOC
to O
the O
congregation O
. O

in O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
, O
with O
a O
cry O
for O
help O
. O

He O
also O
brought O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
, O
whose O
transcript O
I O
have O
handed O
over O
. O

My O
son B-PER
’s I-PER
letter B-TER
is O
written O
in O
Romanian B-LOC
. O

Since O
we O
only O
ever O
spoke O
and O
wrote O
German B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
can O
only O
assume O
that O
my O
son B-PER
did O
not O
want O
the O
German B-LOC
officer O
to O
read O
the O
letter B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
of O
the O
community B-TER
of O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
behaved O
magnificently O
, O
although O
most O
of O
them O
were O
already O
impoverished B-TER
. O

They O
donated B-TER
food B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
shoes B-TER
in O
large O
amounts O
. O

They O
also O
gave O
Elsässer B-PER
a O
large O
shipment O
of O
champagne O
, O
ham B-TER
, O
bacon B-TER
, O
new O
shoes B-TER
and O
fur B-TER
coats I-TER
for O
the O
SS B-ORG
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
so O
that O
the O
SS B-ORG
was O
satisfied O
and O
refrained O
from O
taking O
possession O
of O
things O
intended O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
was O
a O
shipment O
of O
4 O
- O
5 O
trucks O
. O

( O

personally O
, O
El- B-PER
crossed O

The O
jeweler O
Goldstein O
from O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
( O
whose O
famil B-TER
y O
was O
together O
with O
my O
son B-PER
) O
gave O
Elsässer B-PER
, O
among O
other O
innumerable O
gifts O
handwritten O

, O
- O

- O
( O

) O
a O
golden O
watch O
for O
himself O
and O
other O
objects O
for O
his O
wife B-TER
and O
daughter B-TER
. O

From O
us O
personally O
, O
Elsässer B-PER
received O
valuable O
gifts O
, O
leather O
goods O
, O
jewelry O
, O
etc O
.. O
handwritten O
addition O
Elsässer B-PER
told B-TER
us O
further O
: O
My O
son B-PER
was O
his O
most O
outstanding O
worker B-TER
. O

When O
a O
difficult O
part O
of O
the O
technical O
work B-TER
was O
finished O
, O
a O
big O
party O
was O
celebrated O
. O

Elsässer B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
having O
my O
son B-PER
and O
daughter B-PER
- I-PER
in I-PER
- I-PER
law I-PER
invited O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
festival O
he B-PER
and O
his O
wife B-PER
were O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
on O
a O
sleigh O
. O

Elsässer B-PER
gave O
the O
coachman O
the O
instruction O
: O
Go O
where O
Mr. O
Rosengarten O
wants O
you O
to O
go O
. O

Apparently O
he O
wanted O
to O
give O
him O
the O
opportunity O
to O
escape B-TER
back O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
via O
the O
river B-LOC
Bug I-LOC
. O

But O
my O
son B-PER
did O
not O
take O
that O
chance O
. O

Because O
for O
every O
Jew O
who O
fled B-TER
, O
10 O
others O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

Elsässer B-PER
told O
us O
this O
, O
albeit O
not O
with O
these O
very O
words O
, O
and O
added O
: O
A O
Rosengarten O
does O
not O
do O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

My O
son B-PER
’s I-PER
letter B-TER
was O
dated O
September O
14 O
, O
1943 O
, O
but O
my O
statement O
in O
the O
preface O
to O
the O
letter B-TER
, O
namely O
that O
Elsässer B-PER
came O
to O
us O
in O
September O
, O
is O
inaccurate O
, O
he O
did O
n’t O
come O
until O
mid- O
October O
or O
late O
October O
. O

After O
he O
had O

short O

a O

in O
a O
safe O
way O

that O
the O

We O
always O
said O

that O

My O

once O

My O
son B-PER
gave O
her O
the O
only O

still O
owned O

Sometime O
before O
that O
, O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
my O
son B-PER
had O
arrived O
, O
obviously O
in O
his O
own O
handwriting O
, O
which O
contained O
a O
sign O
of O
life O
from O
T. B-LOC

The O
letter B-TER
was O
written O
on O
very O
good O
white O
stationery O

and O
sent O
in O
an O
equally O
good O
white O

from O
a O

addressed O
to O

This O
was O
a O
very O
unusual O
formulation O
in O
the O
style O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
of O
the O
Reich O
, O
and O
the O
letter O
was O
also O
written O
in O
this O
style O

Apparently O
he O
had O
given O
it O
to O
an O
officer O
who O
went O
on O
vacation O
to O
Germany B-LOC

and O
the O

I O
am O
convinced O
that O
the O
only O
reason O
that O
my O
son B-PER
wrote O
the O
letter B-TER
in O
Romanian B-LOC
is O
that O
the O
letter B-TER
was O
delivered O
by O
a O
German B-LOC
officer O
, O
and O
my O
son B-PER
, O
God O
bless O

want O

I O

I O
said O

report B-TER

no O

known O
to O
me O
that O
an O
SS B-ORG

had O
sought O

Mrs. O

a O
few O
of O
the O
people O
mentioned O
in O
the O

personally O
. O

She O
told O
me O
that O
relatively O
often O
SS B-ORG

from O
Bukovina B-LOC
and O
Transnistria B-LOC
came O
to O
Chernivtsi B-LOC
who O
brought O
news O
about O
the O
deportees B-TER
, O
and O
took O
food B-TER
for O
them O
, O
not O
infrequently O
even O
free O
of O
charge O
. O

Her O
own O
father B-TER
was O
interned B-TER
in O

died O
there O
, O
and O
she O
had O
sent O

In O

of O
a O
letter B-TER
of O
Mr. O
Jaegerndorf B-PER
to O
Dr. B-PER
Fildermann I-PER
from O
1944 O
contained O
in O
our O
archives O
in O
volume O

, O
I O
found O
a O
remark O
referring O
to O
the O
family B-TER
of O
the O
engineer O
Rosengarten B-PER
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
family B-TER
Segall B-PER
. O

The O
remark O
reads O
: O
Dear O
friends O
! O
... O
nevertheless O
, O
I O
feel O
compelled O
to O
warmly O
word O
missing O
, O
probably O
recommend O
to O
you O
again O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
Tulcin B-LOC
Jews O
, O
and O
I O
will O
assume O
that O
he O
has O
not O
only O
discussed O
this O
case O
with O
you O
, O
but O
that O
he O
will O
also O
bring O
something O
concrete O
with O
him O
. O

I O
myself O
wrote O
to O
you O
in O
detail O
at O
the O
time O
, O
after O
Mr O
Segall B-PER
’s I-PER
visit O
, O
and O
asked O
you O
to O
send O
an O
urgent O
order O
from O
there O
to O
the O
Tulcin B-LOC
Prefecture O
to O
demand O
the O
return O
of O
all O
Jews B-TER
who O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
pertaining O
request O
was O
unsuccessful O
and O
today O
there O
is O
nobody O
left O
to O
bring O
back O
. O

My O
personal O
intervention O
in O
Tulcin B-LOC
in O
this O
matter O
probably O
was O
successful O
in O
so O
far O
that O
the O
order O
was O
given O
for O
the O
families B-TER
Segall B-PER
and O
Ing O
. O

Rosengarten B-PER
to O
bring O
them O
back O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
chain O
of O
circumstances O
they O
were O
already O
dead O
two O
days O
before O
that O
, O
just O
like O
