The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
During O
the O
rule O
of O
the O
Czechs B-TER
we O
did O
very O
well O
in O
Várpalánka B-LOC
. O

They O
never O
abused O
Jews O
and O
we O
enjoyed O
equal O
rights O
with O
the O
others O
. O

When O
the O
Hungarians B-TER
came O
in O
, O
they O
took O
away O
the O
trade O
licenses O
and O
abused B-TER
the I-TER
Jewish I-TER
inhabitants I-TER
of O
the O
village O
quite O
a O
lot O
. O

There O
was O
a O
garrison O
in O
the O
village O
and O
the O
soldiers B-TER
marching O
there O
sang O
satirical O
songs O
, O
the O
target O
of O
which O
was O
Jews O
. O

Later O
, O
incited O
by O
young O
ethnic O
Germans B-TER
they O
broke O
in O
some O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
led O
by O
officers O
called O
Kiss B-PER
and O
István B-PER
Boldog I-PER
. O

They O
went O
to O
Munkács B-LOC
every O
evening O
and O
they O
broke O
in O
Jewish O
houses O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
those O
were O
military B-TER
exercises O
. O

They O
robbed O
the O
Jews O
of O
every O
possession O
and O
beat O
them O
to O
a O
pulp O
. O

They O
came O
back O
to O
Palánka B-LOC
at O
12 O
o'clock O
at O
night O
and O
continued O
with O
us O
. O

Terrible O
noises O
, O
screams O
could O
be O
heard O
in O
the O
night O
. O

We O
lived O
through O
terrible O
times O
, O
trembling O
in O
horrible O
fear O
; O
that O
was O
the O
time O
when O
I O
got O
a O
heart O
ailment O
. O

The O
army B-TER
terrorized O
the O
inhabitants O
all O
the O
time O
and O
beat B-TER
Jewish I-TER
men I-TER
horribly I-TER
without O
any O
reason O
. O

A O
lance O
corporal O
called O
Vörös B-PER
also O
behaved O
in O
such O
a O
base O
way O
that O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
in O
the O
evening O
at O
all O
. O

That O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
terror O
for O
us O
. O

Then O
we O
already O
had O
to O
be O
in O
hiding B-TER
in O
Hungary B-LOC
; O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
sleep O
at O
home O
, O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
at O
our O
relatives O
living O
in O
nearby O
towns O
, O
where O
we O
slept B-TER
in I-TER
barns I-TER
and I-TER
haylofts I-TER
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
had O
already O
treated O
us O
in O
an O
inhuman O
and O
cruel O
way O
before O
the O
German B-TER
invasion O
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
committed O
more O
horrible O
tortures O
than O
the O
Germans B-TER
did O
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
completely O
ruined O
us O
psychically O
. O

70 O
Jewish O
families O
lived O
in O
Várpalánka B-LOC
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
tradesmen O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
lived O
in O
good O
financial O
conditions O
and O
were O
not O
short O
of O
anything O
. O

I O
was O
a O
dressmaker O
and O
I O
earned O
as O
much O
as O
I O
needed O
. O

It O
was O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
police B-TER
of O
Munkács B-LOC
who O
ordered O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
decrees I-TER
against O
us O
. O

The O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
village O
behaved O
in O
a O
relatively O
considerate O
way O
, O
except O
the O
ethnic O
German B-TER
members O
of O
the O
organization O
Jugendheiz O
, O
who O
were O
the O
followers O
of O
Hitler B-PER
and O
acted O
in O
a O
shameful O
manner O
towards O
us O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
give O
10,000 O
pengős O
to O
the O
notary O
's O
office O
in O
order O
to O
let O
us O
stay O
in O
the O
village O
but O
they O
could O
not O
do O
anything O
. O

After O
Passover B-TER
they O
took O
us O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
in O
the O
brickyard O
of O
Munkács B-LOC
. O

There O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
forced O
the O
men B-TER
to O
crawl O
on O
their O
bellies O
in O
the O
mud O
and O
hit O
their O
heads O
with O
rifle O
butts O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
and O
3 O
Germans B-TER
, O
one O
of O
them O
was O
called O
Sefcsenko B-PER
, O
beat O
the O
young O
boys O
extremely O
hard O
, O
some O
of O
them O
they O
beat O
to O
death B-TER
. O

We O
were O
already O
so O
desperate O
that O
we O
could O
hardly O
wait O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
lied O
that O
they O
would O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Hortobágy B-LOC
. O

They O
entrained O
us O
in O
Munkács B-LOC
but O
they O
did O
not O
give O
us O
water O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
give O
us O
a O
bucket O
for O
toilet O
purposes O
. O

In O
Sátoraljaújhely B-LOC
, O
Jewish O
labour B-TER
servicemen I-TER
saw O
us O
and O
they O
wanted O
to O
give O
us O
water O
, O
which O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
policemen B-TER
did O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
do O
so O
. O

80 O
of O
us O
were O
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
: O
fainting O
old O
people O
, O
crying O
little O
children B-TER
. O

They O
handed O
us O
over O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
told O
us O
that O
they O
would O
take O
us O
to O
work B-TER
at O
a O
good O
place O
. O

On O
our O
arrival O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
they O
separated B-TER
me O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family B-TER
and O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
was O
in O
store O
for O
me O
. O

We O
did O
not O
even O
want O
to O
believe O
it O
from O
a O
Slovakian B-TER
woman B-TER
there O
that O
they O
were O
burning O
our O
family B-TER
members O
in O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

They O
took O
all O
the O
expectant O
mothers B-TER
away O
and O
still O
we O
managed O
to O
hide O
an O
expectant O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
gave O
birth O
to O
her O
child B-TER
in O
secret O
; O
of O
course O
we O
arranged O
it O
so O
that O
the O
child B-TER
would O
not O
remain O
alive O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Geislingen B-LOC
, O
we O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
place O
to O
stay O
, O
because O
we O
could O
sit O
at O
a O
table O
, O
where O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

We O
did O
well O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
but O
later O
German B-TER
Capos B-TER
came O
and O
stole O
our O
food B-TER
. I-TER

We O
slept O
in O
cold O
rooms O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
worked B-TER
in O
a O
factory O
, O
which O
was O
not O
heated O
. O

Our O
hands O
got O
frostbitten O
and O
the O
flesh O
between O
our O
fingers O
cracked O
. O

After O
Passover B-TER
, O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Münchenallsch O
where O
we O
stayed O
only O
for O
two O
weeks O
, O
then O
they O
entrained O
us O
. O

We O
did O
not O
receive O
anything O
else O
to O
eat B-TER
than O
a O
little O
bread B-TER
for O
a O
week O
. O

We O
starved B-TER
very O
, O
very O
much O
, O
we O
lost O
weight O
, O
we O
were O
nothing O
but O
skin O
and O
bones O
and O
several O
men B-TER
died B-TER
. I-TER

The O
American B-TER
troops O
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
1st O
May O
. O

They O
supplied O
us O
with O
the O
best O
things O
imaginable O
, O
like O
first O
- O
class O
food B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
shoes O
. O

They O
took O
us O
to O
Illdorf B-LOC
near O
Stahldoch O
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
then O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
home O
for O
members O
of O
the O
Hitlerjugend B-ORG
in O
Feldafing B-LOC
. O

We O
received O
excellent O
medical O
treatment O
. O

A O
Czech B-TER
soldie B-TER
r O
came O
for O
us O
and O
told O
us O
not O
to O
speak O
Hungarian B-TER
anywhere O
; O
they O
put O
us O
in O
a O
car O
and O
after O
a O
nine O
- O
hour O
journey O
we O
arrived O
in O
Pilsen B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
Czech B-TER
villages O
, O
children B-TER
, O
old O
people O
and O
men B-TER
ran O
to O
meet O
us O
and O
received O
us O
very O
happily O
. O

We O
were O
crying O
from O
emotion O
when O
we O
saw O
that O
welcome O
boards O
were O
put O
on O
view O
and O
mothers B-TER
were O
holding O
their O
children B-TER
up O
in O
the O
windows O
. O

Then O
they O
took O
us O
to O
Prague B-LOC
by O
bus O
and O
from O
there O
, O
we O
came O
to O
Pest B-LOC
through O
Pozsony B-LOC
. O

Now O
I O
am O
going O
home O
to O
see O
whether O
my O
little O
son B-TER
is O
there O
and O
then O
we O
will O
go B-TER
together O
to O
Palestine B-TER
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
living O
among O
the O
evil O
people O
at O
home O
, O
so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
work O
on O
building O
of O
our O
new O
homeland O
in O
Palestine B-TER
. O
