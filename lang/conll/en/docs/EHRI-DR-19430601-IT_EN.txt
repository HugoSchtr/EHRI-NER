Nuncio B-PER
Cassulo I-PER
’s I-PER
visit O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
apparently O
had O
a O
far O
more O
definite O
purpose O
than O
had O
been O
assumed O
. O

I O
have O
heard O
, O
that O
is O
, O
that O
the O
Holy O
Father O
is O
said O
to O
have O
expressed O
the O
wish O
to O
exert O
a O
direct O
influence O
on O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
Government B-TER
so O
as O
to O
obtain O
a O
more O
humane O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER

Monsignor O
Cassulo O
’s O
journey O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
believed O
therefore O
to O
have O
been O
a O
voyage O
of O
inspection O
in O
order O
to O
report O
to O
the O
Vatican O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

As O
to O
the O
question O
if O
the O
Nuncio O
’s O
journey O
served O
indeed O
the O
purpose O
of O
providing O
an O
exact O
picture O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
situation O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
I O
already O
reported O
on O
this O
in O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Nuncio O
was O
not O
convinced O
by O
the O
tame O
ghetto B-TER
he O
was O
shown O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
Vatican O
concerning O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
was O
joined O
by O
further O
pressure O
from O
the O
international O
Red B-TER
Cross I-TER
, O
which O
has O
friends O
and O
supporters O
among O
the O
highest O
Romanian O
circles O
. O

As O
for O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
as O
follows O
. O

When O
Romanian B-LOC
and O
German B-TER
troops B-TER
occupied B-TER
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews B-TER
at O
first O
experienced O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
– O
particularly O
in O
Odessa B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
about O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
persons O
who O
had O
not O
been O
evacuated B-TER
– O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
carried O
out O
a O
registration B-TER
and O
some O
arrests B-TER
. O

After O
the O
terrorist O
acts O
and O
particularly O
after O
the O
one O
of O
23rd O
October O
there O
were O
brutal O
reprisals O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
numbers O
, O
but O
many O
thousands O
, O
perhaps O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Jews B-TER
were O
eliminated B-TER
and O
arrested B-TER
. O

In O
was O
then O
that O
temporary O
ghettoes B-TER
and O
places O
for O
concentration B-TER
were O
created O
. O

Orders O
however O
were O
as O
yet O
unclear O
, O
and O
already O
in O
November O
many O
of O
these O
Jews B-TER
were O
set O
free O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
December O
’ O
41 O
and O
in O
January O
’ O
42 O
, O
during O
the O
harshest O
of O
winters O
, O
that O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
decided O
to O
remove B-TER
the O
Jews O
from O
Odessa B-LOC
. O

I O
hardly O
need O
to O
describe O
how O
this O
emigration B-TER
took O
place O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
themselves O
admit O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
with O
greater O
humanity O
. O

Anyway O
, O
those O
who O
managed O
to O
reach O
on O
foot O
the O
places O
of O
concentration B-TER
, O
were O
banned O
to O
ghettoes B-TER
, O
that O
is O
to O
sites O
in O
the O
suburbs O
of O
small O
provincial O
towns O
. O

Considering O
the O
meteorological O
and O
political O
climate O
, O
they O
were O
treated O
with O
scant O
regard O
and O
no O
doubt O
the O
well O
- O
known O
oppressive B-TER
measures I-TER
will O
have O
continued O
there O
, O
set O
off O
by O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
, O
for O
their O
part O
, O
have O
acted O
similarly O
in O
the O
areas O
surrounding O
the O
territories O
inhabited O
by O
German B-TER
communities O
. O

This O
system O
of O
things O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
has O
been O
useful O
to O
all O
to O
rebuild O
what O
had O
been O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
losses O
and O
to O
create O
benefits O
, O
lasted O
more O
or O
less O
intensely O
, O
more O
or O
less O
arbitrarily O
until O
June O
of O
last O
year O
. O

After O
that O
the O
situation O
stabilized O
or O
, O
to O
put O
it O
more O
exactly O
, O
was O
rendered O
legal O
. O

For O
a O
start O
, O
rules B-TER
began O
to O
be O
published O
regarding O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
the O
deadline O
for O
reporting O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
also O
the O
activity O
of O
Jews B-TER
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
ghettoes B-TER
has O
been O
specified O
, O
they O
have O
been O
granted O
a O
form O
of O
self B-TER
- I-TER
government I-TER
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
if O
the O
oppressive B-TER
measures I-TER
have O
ceased O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
would O
depend O
on O
the O
local O
authorities O
and O
on O
whether O
the O
Jews B-TER
are O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
compromise O
with O
them O
. O

What O
can O
be O
said O
with O
certainty O
is O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
during O
the O
past O
months O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
not O
grown O
any O
worse O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
this O
in O
person O
. O

In O
Balta B-LOC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
approx O
. O

fifteen O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
is O
in O
a O
suburban O
part O
of O
the O
town O
and O
is O
made O
up O
of O
wretched O
cottages O
where O
a O
great O
many O
families B-TER
live O
in O
deplorable O
hygienic B-TER
conditions O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curfew B-TER
imposed O
on O
the O
ghetto B-TER
which O
starts O
at O
sundown O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
are O
not O
allowed O
into O
the O
public O
market O
, O
nor O
can O
they O
frequent O
the O
town B-TER
’s I-TER
establishments I-TER
. O

There O
is O
a O
municipal O
authority O
that O
manages O
the O
community O
and O
supplies O
the O
required O
manpower O
. O

Jews O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
in O
the O
surrounding O
areas O
. O

Those O
who O
work B-TER
receive O
one O
mark O
a O
day O
and O
a O
substantial O
bread O
ration O
. O

The O
more O
unfortunate O
Jews B-TER
, O
however O
, O
live O
or O
rather O
vegetate O
inside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
; O
the O
more O
able O
ones O
and O
particularly O
the O
young O
female O
elements O
manage O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
live O
outside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
in O
any O
case O
enjoy O
visible O
advantages O
for O
their O
lives O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
this O
situation O
in O
Balta B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Rybnitsa B-LOC
is O
more O
or O
less O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
other O
ghettoes B-TER
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
numbers O
of O
deported B-TER
or O
concentrated B-TER
Jews I-TER
change O
all O
the O
time O
. O

( O
I O
have O
myself O
seen O
in O
Balta B-LOC
about O
a O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
just O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
, O
mostly O
young O
people O
assigned O
to O
four O
months O
of O
compulsory O
work O
there O
) O
. O

In O
Bereswka O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
even O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
Prefecture O
, O
to O
posts O
of O
varying O
importance O
, O
with O
regular O
salaries O
. O

This O
denotes O
a O
marked O
improvement O
compared O
to O
last O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
in O
itself O
would O
not O
have O
any O
great O
significance O
, O
if O
some O
recent O
information O
, O
such O
as O
the O
news O
that O
has O
prompted O
the O
present O
report O
, O
did O
not O
confer O
on O
the O
situation O
an O
aspect O
that O
I O
believe O
ought O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
an O
excellent O
source O
that O
recently O
, O
at O
an O
ordinary O
conference O
of O
the O
Prefects O
of O
Transnistria B-LOC
held O
by O
the O
Governor O
in O
Rybniysa B-LOC
, O
these O
officials O
allegedly O
gave O
as O
their O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
present O
situation O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
war B-TER
remains O
uncertain O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
seemed O
advisable O
to O
improve O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
or O
to O
lessen O
the O
restrictions B-TER
on O
their O
freedom O
and O
allow O
them O
ways O
to O
resume O
a O
greater O
activity O
. O

Reportedly O
there O
was O
even O
talk O
of O
giving O
the O
Jews O
some O
compensation B-TER
for O
the O
damages O
they O
have O
suffered O
. O

Thus O
their O
situation O
would O
be O
rendered O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
and O
in O
other O
Romanian B-LOC
towns O
. O

Naturally O
this O
news B-TER
, O
which O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
discernible O
general O
trend O
towards O
improving O
the O
condition B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
, O
has O
annoyed O
German B-TER
circles O
and O
made O
them O
mistrustful O
. O

They O
suggest O
that O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
can O
not O
be O
handled O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
any O
differently O
from O
how O
it O
has O
been O
handled O
until O
now O
. O

The O
reasons O
given O
by O
the O
Prefects O
and O
by O
those O
in O
favour O
of O
improving O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews B-TER
arise O
from O
a O
pessimistic O
view O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
’s O
general O
situation O
, O
and O
that O
is O
totally O
unacceptable O
. O

They O
are O
therefore O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
entire O
matter O
is O
essentially O
decided O
by O
the O
Government B-TER
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
influenced O
by O
the O
steps O
undertaken O
by O
the O
Vatican O
and O
by O
Geneva B-TER
, O
and O
has O
easily O
taken O
root O
in O
the O
Anglophile O
and O
Francophile O
circles O
, O
whether O
military B-TER
or O
civilian O
, O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
therefore O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
Romania O
and O
of O
the O
opinion O
held O
by O
certain O
classes O
of O
Romanians B-LOC
concerning O
the O
development O
of O
that O
situation O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
am O
reporting O
all O
this O
because O
it O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
ascertained O
facts O
and O
conversations O
that O
have O
actually O
taken O
place O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
in O
local O
Romanian B-LOC
circles O
there O
is O
a O
widespread O
feeling O
that O
the O
present O
events O
warrant O
serious O
worries O
, O
a O
feeling O
caused O
mainly O
by O
the O
uncertainty O
about O
German B-TER
intentions O
and O
capabilities O
with O
regard O
to O
Russia B-LOC
