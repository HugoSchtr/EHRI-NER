Testimony O
: O
We O
lived O
in O
our O
own O
little O
house O
on O
Dworskiego B-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
Przemyśl B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
seized O
Przemyśl B-LOC
in O
1941 O
, O
my O
father O
still O
ran O
a O
little O
trade O
of O
various O
goods O
. O

We O
had O
[ O
money O
] O
for O
living O
and O
we O
did O
n’t O
lack O
anything O
. O

My O
sister O
Tosia B-PER
was O
4 O
years O
older O
than O
me O
( O
she O
was O
born O
in O
1930 O
) O
. O

I O
remember O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
ordered O
the O
Jews O
to O
wear O
armbands B-TER
. O

Father O
did O
n’t O
put O
the O
armband B-TER
on O
for O
3 O
months O
, O
but O
later O
he O
had O
to O
, O
because O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
for O
not O
wearing O
it O
. O

In O
1942 O
we O
had O
to O
move O
out O
of O
our O
house O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
there O
my O
father O
had O
his O
store O
of O
various O
goods O
for O
only O
2 O
weeks O
, O
because O
there O
was O
an O
action O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
have O
stamps O
on O
our O
papers O
therefore O
we O
had O
to O
be O
resettled O
. O

My O
parents O
went O
to O
the O
gathering O
place O
and O
we O
walked O
them O
there O
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
cried O
and O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
be O
separated O
, O
but O
my O
father O
calmed O
us O
down O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
would O
come O
back O
and O
my O
uncle O
, O
who O
was O
a O
commandant O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
, O
Ordners- O
from O
Yiddish O
: O
policemen O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Police O
in O
the O
ghetto O
called O
Ordnungdienst O
Polizei O
( O
“ O
Order O
Service O
” O
) O
[ O
recorders O
’s O
remark O
] O
. O

took O
us O
to O
auntie O
’s O
apartment O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

My O
Aunt O
had O
permission O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
as O
a O
result O
one O
had O
to O
go O
through O
document O
checks O
. O

After O
a O
few O
hours O
, O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
-man O
came O
, O
my O
aunt O
showed O
him O
a O
document O
and O
said O
that O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
we O
were O
her O
children B-TER
. O

My O
father O
and O
mommy O
did O
n’t O
come O
back O
and O
we O
cried O
a O
lot O
. O

Finally O
they O
came O
back O
from O
the O
gathering O
place O
, O
where O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
line O
and O
did O
n’t O
dare O
move O
. O

Our O
uncle O
Manek B-PER
Trau I-PER
, O
who O
was O
the O
commandant O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
, O
rescued O
my O
parents O
by O
saying O
that O
my O
father O
was O
a O
locksmith O
, O
although O
daddy O
never O
was O
a O
locksmith O
and O
did O
n’t O
know O
anything O
about O
locksmithing O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
end O
of O
July O
1943 O
, O
and O
again O
in O
November O
there O
was O
an O
action O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
had O
to O
move O
twice O
, O
because O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
made O
smaller O
. O

During O
the O
second O
action O
we O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
little O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
, I-TER
which O
my O
father O
covered O
with O
a O
wardrobe O
moving O
it O
forward O
with O
a O
rope O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
be O
able O
to O
recognize O
whether O
there O
was O
an O
entry O
to O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
behind O
the O
wardrobe O
. O

Gestapo B-ORG
-men O
went O
searching O
whether O
Jews O
were O
hiding B-TER
and O
they O
came O
into O
our O
apartment O
. O

They O
broke O
the O
door O
down O
with O
an O
axe O
and O
made O
a O
search O
of O
the O
apartment O
. O

Using O
the O
axe O
they O
broke O
down O
a O
buffet O
and O
a O
wardrobe O
, O
behind O
which O
the O
door O
to O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
was O
. O

Fortunately O
they O
did O
n’t O
move O
the O
wardrobe O
away O
. O

I O
was O
terrified O
when O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
-men O
were O
breaking O
down O
the O
wardrobe O
, O
but O
I O
stood O
quietly O
and O
did O
n’t O
cry O
. O

There O
was O
little O
room O
in O
the O
still B-TER
- I-TER
room I-TER
and O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
there O
for O
24 O
hours O
. O

There O
, O
we O
had O
bread B-TER
and O
water O
. O

We O
relieved O
ourselves O
in O
the O
bucket O
. O

Uncle O
did O
n’t O
come O
to O
us O
until O
the O
next O
day O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
told O
us O
that O
the O
action O
was O
over O
. O

After O
the O
action O
the O
quarter B-TER
was O
divided O
into O
two O
parts O
: O
one O
for O
employed O
and O
the O
other O
for O
unemployed O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
the O
quarter O
for O
working O
people O
, O
although O
my O
father O
was O
n’t O
employed O
. O

He O
had O
to O
hide B-TER
there O
, O
so O
the O
commandant O
of O
the O
labour B-TER
camp I-TER
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
would O
n’t O
see O
us O
. O

He O
was O
a O
German B-TER
, O
an O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
. O

Children B-TER
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
be O
in O
the O
quarter O
for O
working O
people O
and O
because O
of O
it O
we O
went O
out O
on O
the O
street O
only O
when O
the O
commandant O
was O
n’t O
in O
the O
quarter O
. O

In O
the O
quarter B-TER
for O
working O
people O
there O
was O
a O
Jewish O
orchestra O
, O
a O
little O
choir O
and O
a O
Jewish O
ballet O
. O

They O
performed O
for O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
and O
when O
the O
commandant O
was O
n’t O
there O
they O
rehearsed O
and O
played O
for O
the O
Jews O
who O
ruled O
in O
theghetto O
. O

They O
had O
their O
own O
premises O
and O
sometimes O
I O
snuck O
out O
of O
the O
house O
and O
went O
there O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
music B-TER
and O
singing O
. O

Janka B-PER
Haubenówna I-PER
was O
singing O
and O
Stegmanówna O
was O
dancing O
. O

On O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
of O
September O
1943 O
there O
was O
a O
third O
action O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

Daddy O
already O
knew O
before O
that O
there O
would O
be O
an O
action O
and O
hid B-TER
us O
in O
the O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
. O

It O
was O
above O
the O
attic O
, O
and O
the O
entrance O
to O
this O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
was O
through O
the O
opening O
in O
the O
roof O
, O
and O
then O
sheet O
iron O
was O
slipped O
in O
, O
so O
no O
one O
would O
notice O
. O

There O
were O
18 O
of O
us O
there O
. O

Among O
the O
others O
who O
were O
saved O
was O
Samuel B-PER
Hauben I-PER
, O
who O
in O
a O
few O
days O
would O
be O
killed B-TER
by O
the O
watchman B-TER
who O
patrolled O
under O
the O
fence O
surrounding O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

Hauben B-PER
stole O
things O
from O
the O
apartments O
abandoned O
by O
the O
Jews O
during O
the O
action O
and O
traded O
those O
things O
under O
the O
fence O
for O
food B-TER
with O
the O
Christian B-TER
tradesmen O
. O

Every O
time O
he O
gave O
50 O
zloty O
to O
the O
watchman B-TER
( O
who O
previously O
was O
a O
Soviet O
soldier O
) O
. O

Once O
he O
gave O
him O
only O
10 O
zloty O
and O
then O
the O
watchman B-TER
killed B-TER
him O
, O
thrusting O
into O
his O
mouth O
the O
10 O
zloty O
piece O
and O
robbing O
the O
dead B-TER
body I-TER
. O

After O
that O
action O
we O
found O
out O
that O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
would O
be O
liquidated O
and O
all O
Jews O
would O
be O
taken O
away O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
this O
my O
parents O
decided O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
town O
at O
a O
Polish B-TER
woman O
’s O
with O
whom O
they O
were O
acquainted O
and O
with O
whom O
daddy O
had O
previously O
arranged O
. O

My O
mommy O
and O
sister O
left O
earlier O
and O
daddy O
and O
I O
were O
supposed O
to O
leave O
the O
next O
day O
. O

But O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
, O
because O
the O
action B-TER
started O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Daddy O
and O
I O
hid B-TER
again O
in O
the O
same O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
. O

This O
time O
there O
were O
20 O
people O
there O
. O

Other O
people O
also O
wanted O
to O
come O
in O
there O
, O
but O
daddy O
did O
n’t O
let O
them O
, O
because O
there O
was O
no O
room O
and O
the O
ceiling O
below O
us O
, O
above O
the O
attic O
, O
would O
collapse O
. O

Faced O
with O
this O
, O
the O
Jews O
who O
did O
n’t O
come O
in O
, O
threatened O
that O
they O
would O
denounce B-TER
us O
in O
case O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
detect O
them O
. O

And O
so O
they O
did O
. O

The O
next O
day O
German B-TER
soldiers O
came O
, O
they O
climbed O
the O
ladder O
up O
to O
the O
roof O
and O
started O
to O
beat O
us O
with O
axes O
above O
our O
hiding B-TER
- I-TER
place I-TER
and O
called O
out O
: O
Heraus O
. O

Everyone O
came O
out O
except O
daddy O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman O
named O
Feuerowa B-PER
and O
I O
stayed O
. O

We O
hid O
under O
the O
feather O
bed O
, O
but O
a O
German B-TER
saw O
my O
father O
’s O
legs O
sticking O
out O
from O
the O
feather O
bed O
through O
the O
opening O
in O
the O
roof O
and O
shot O
in O
a O
way O
that O
wounded O
both O
my O
daddy O
’s O
legs O
and O
blood O
started O
to O
run O
from O
his O
wounds O
. O

I O
got O
scared O
of O
the O
Germans B-TER
’ O
screaming O
and O
I O
yelled O
for O
my O
father O
to O
come O
out O
and O
he O
came O
out O
on O
to O
the O
roof O
with O
me O
. O

From O
there O
we O
went O
down O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
pushed O
and O
kicked O
my O
father O
. O

When O
we O
were O
to O
leave O
the O
building O
, O
my O
father O
saw O
Jews O
standing O
in O
the O
courtyard O
with O
their O
hands O
in O
the O
air O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
basement B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
then O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
First O
floor O
here O
refers O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
according O
to O
the O
American O
standards O
. O

and O
in O
the O
courtyard O
. O

We O
hid B-TER
in O
the O
basement B-TER
, O
covering O
ourselves O
with O
plywood O
that O
was O
there O
. O

My O
father O
threw O
the O
wrap O
that O
he O
had O
in O
his O
hands O
into O
the O
neighboring O
basement O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
searched O
the O
whole O
building O
and O
were O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
but O
they O
did O
n’t O
move O
the O
plywood O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
other O
basement O
, O
where O
they O
found O
the O
wrap O
, O
they O
searched O
thoroughly O
and O
even O
dug O
. O

We O
sat O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
until O
the O
night O
and O
later O
, O
wounded O
in O
both O
legs O
, O
my O
father O
dragged O
himself O
on O
all O
fours O
to O
the O
apartment O
and O
washed O
the O
wounds O
with O
water O
. O

At O
night O
my O
uncle O
came O
to O
us O
and O
called O
over O
Dr. O
Schattner B-PER
who O
bandaged O
daddy O
’s O
legs O
. O

Uncle O
told O
us O
to O
hide O
, O
because O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
going O
from O
house O
to O
house O
and O
blowing O
up O
the O
bunkers B-TER
, O
but O
father O
could O
n’t O
get O
up O
and O
stayed O
in O
bed O
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
and O
blew O
up O
the O
bunkers B-TER
in O
the O
basement B-TER
and O
in O
the O
attic O
in O
the O
building O
where O
we O
lived O
, O
but O
did O
n’t O
come O
into O
our O
apartment O
and O
in O
this O
manner O
we O
were O
saved O
again O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
under O
the O
wardrobe O
and O
father O
hid B-TER
under O
the O
feather O
bed O
. O

It O
was O
in O
the O
building O
on O
26 B-LOC
Iwaszkiewicza I-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
next O
day O
daddy O
and O
I O
left O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
at O
night O
in O
secret O
and O
we O
hid B-TER
at O
a O
Polish B-TER
woman O
’s O
in O
Przemyśl B-LOC
where O
mommy O
was O
supposed O
to O
wait O
for O
us O
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
find O
her O
there O
, O
because O
she O
had O
returned O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
find O
out O
what O
happened O
to O
us O
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
the O

a O
Polish B-TER
bloodhound O
encountered O
her O
and O
took O
all O
my O

When O
