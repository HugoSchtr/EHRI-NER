The O
persons O
in O
question O
have O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Our O
father O
was O
a O
grain O
dealer O
. O

He O
had O
a O
house O
and O
we O
made O
a O
decent O
living O
from O
our O
income O
until O
around O
1943 O
, O
when O
the O
front O
was O
approaching O
our O
town O
. O

One O
year O
before O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
, O
Hungarian B-TER
soldiers B-TER
marching O
to O
the O
frontline O
came O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
street O
. O

They O
blocked O
a O
section O
of O
it O
and O
then O
entered O
each O
house O
. O

They O
were O
looting B-TER
and O
beating B-TER
up I-TER
women B-TER
and O
sometimes O
even O
children B-TER
. O

Afterwards O
they O
chased O
the O
people O
out O
of O
the O
houses O
and O
forced O
them O
to O
do O
punitive B-TER
exercises I-TER
on O
the O
street O
. O

Later O
it O
turned O
even O
worse O
, O
since O
they O
started O
firing O
and O
as O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
they O
even O
mounted O
a O
cannon O
in O
the O
street O
. O

A O
few O
people O
died B-TER
or O
were O
wounded O
in O
that O
incident O
. O

After O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
those O
kinds O
of O
acts O
became O
common O
occurrences O
and O
were O
institutionalised O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
looting B-TER
and O
searching O
for O
money O
and O
jewellery O
all O
the O
time O
. O

We O
were O
very O
scared O
. O

The O
mayor B-TER
was O
Engelbreckl B-PER
and O
we O
had O
no O
cause O
for O
complaint O
against O
him O
. O

However O
, O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
saw O
to O
it O
that O
all O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
decrees I-TER
were O
put O
into O
effect O
ruthlessly O
. O

One O
day O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
all O
the O
Jews O
in O
town O
should O
move B-TER
into O
streets O
designated O
for O
them O
by O
6 O
o’clock O
the O
following O
day O
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
as O
many O
things O
as O
we O
could O
carry O
. O

However O
, O
two O
days O
later O
we O
had O
to O
move O
from O
the O
designated O
streets O
, O
since O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
been O
restricted O
to O
an O
even O
smaller O
area O
. O

Therefore O
we O
had O
to O
move O
into O
another O
street O
, O
but O
that O
time O
we O
were O
given O
only O
half O
an O
hour O
to O
move O
and O
we O
were O
supervised O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
never O
forgot O
to O
beat O
us O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
from O
Munkács B-LOC
remember O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Black O
Sabbath O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
going O
to O
the O
synagogue B-TER
that O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
Germans B-TER
arrested B-TER
them O
on O
the O
way O
and O
said O
they O
would O
take O
them O
to O
work O
. O

Indeed O
, O
they O
took O
away O
ca O
. O

200 O
men B-TER
and O
made O
them O
remove O
the O
gates O
from O
the O
street O
- O
front O
and O
later O
rounded O
them O
up O
in O
the O
yard O
of O
the O
synagogue B-TER
and O
beat B-TER
them I-TER
up I-TER
severely O
. O

One O
of O
our O
uncles O
, O
Mendel B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
among O
them O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
beat B-TER
him I-TER
up I-TER
so O
badly O
that O
he O
was O
lying O
ill B-TER
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
forced O
the O
men B-TER
to O
bring O
out O
all O
the O
furnishings O
from O
the O
synagogue B-TER
. O

They O
even O
threw B-TER
out I-TER
the O
Torah B-TER
scrolls I-TER
and O
had O
the O
Jews O
wash O
the O
floor O
with O
their O
talliths O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
some O
of O
the O
men B-TER
who O
had O
been O
beaten O
to O
a O
bloody O
pulp O
died B-TER
of O
their O
injuries O
. O

We O
had O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
, O
including O
Segelstein B-PER
and O
others O
. O

We O
had O
a O
soup B-TER
kitchen I-TER
, O
which O
provided O
the O
other O
ghetto B-TER
in O
the O
brickyard O
with O
food B-TER
as O
well O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fence O
and O
it O
was O
not B-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
move I-TER
from O
one O
ghetto B-TER
to O
the O
other O
; O
only O
a O
half O
hour O
was O
given O
a O
day O
to O
do O
that O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
guarded O
by O
military O
gendarmes B-TER
, O
who O
collected B-TER
jewellery O
, O
money O
and O
all O
the O
valuables O
they O
could O
find O
. O

The O
internal O
order O
was O
maintained O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
police I-TER
. O

We O
were O
staying O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
for O
four O
weeks O
. O

One O
morning O
at O
7 O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
broke O
the O
gates O
in O
with O
rifle O
butts O
, O
entered O
the O
flats O
and O
chased O
all O
of O
us O
out O
. O

They O
were O
virtually O
dragging O
people O
out O
of O
bed O
. O

Meanwhile O
they O
were O
beating B-TER
everybody O
mercilessly O
, O
including O
the O
children B-TER
. O

That O
was O
our O
most O
terrifying O
experience O
during O
our O
deportation B-TER
. O

The O
gendarmes B-TER
went O
from O
house O
to O
house O
joined O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
who O
were O
also O
beating O
us O
. O

They O
jointly O
rounded O
up O
everybody O
on O
the O
marketplace O
, O
lined O
us O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
five O
and O
we O
were O
set O
off O
for O
the O
brickyard O
. O

The O
cruelties B-TER
continued O
: O
those O
who O
could O
not O
keep O
pace O
were O
beaten O
to O
a O
pulp O
. O

Among O
many O
others O
, O
one O
of O
our O
relatives O
also O
died B-TER
during O
that O
trip O
, O
because O
he O
had O
a O
stroke B-TER
due O
to O
over O
- O
excitement O
. O

We O
stayed O
five O
more O
days O
in O
the O
brickyard O
ghetto B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
made O
the O
men B-TER
do O
punitive B-TER
exercises I-TER
and O
beat B-TER
them I-TER
up I-TER
once O
again O
. O

Then O
they O
locked O
up O
religious O
men B-TER
and O
forced B-TER
them I-TER
to I-TER
sign I-TER
a O
statement O
that O
read O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
the O
blood B-TER
of I-TER
a I-TER
Christian I-TER
girl I-TER
for O
the O
Passover B-TER
matzo O
. O

They O
beat O
the O
poor O
victims O
until O
they O
signed O
the O
statement O
. O

They O
took O
away O
the O
wealthy O
people O
and O
beat B-TER
them O
to O
a O
pulp O
as O
well O
. O

We O
had O
already O
packed O
up O
our O
luggage O
and O
we O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
when O
they O
searched O
us O
once O
again O
. O

If O
they O
found O
money O
or O
any O
valuable O
item O
on O
someone O
, O
they O
beat B-TER
that O
person O
to O
death B-TER
. O

We O
remember O
an O
ethnic O
German B-TER
named O
Sefcsik B-PER
, O
who O
was O
especially O
cruel O
. O

Before O
our O
departure O
they O
rounded O
up O
the O
girls B-TER
and O
had O
them O
disassemble O
the O
empty O
barracks O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Those O
who O
refused O
to O
go O
were O
beaten O
up O
. O

We O
heard O
that O
we O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
work O
in O
Diósgyőr B-LOC
. O

Soon O
they O
entrained O
us O
. O

Seventy O
people O
were O
put O
into O
our O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
, O
which O
was O
an O
ambulance O
car O
with O
15 O
people O
confined O
to O
a O
bed O
. O

Therefore O
it O
was O
very O
crowded O
. O

The O
passengers O
included O
a O
one O
- O
day O
- O
old O
baby B-TER
, O
a O
little O
boy B-TER
in O
plaster O
to O
the O
waist O
and O
an O
insane B-TER
woman B-TER
as O
well O
as O
many O
patients O
from O
the O
hospital B-TER
and O
people O
from O
the O
home O
for O
the O
aged O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
imagine O
how O
terrible O
journey B-TER
we O
had O
. O

Surprisingly O
enough O
, O
nobody O
died B-TER
in O
our O
car O
. O

At O
departure O
we O
were O
given O
buckets O
for O
water O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
WC O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
had O
bread B-TER
put O
into O
the O
cars O
as O
well O
. O

There O
was O
another O
search O
for O
valuables B-TER
in O
Kassa B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
took O
over O
the O
train B-TER
there O
and O
then O
we O
went O
further O
at O
the O
speed O
of O
a O
fast O
train B-TER
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
on O
May O
25 O
in O
the O
early O
morning O
. O

Polish B-TER
prisoners I-TER
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
assisted O
in O
detraining O
us O
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
behind O
our O
luggage O
. O

They O
lined O
up O
the O
men B-TER
and O
the O
women B-TER
separately O
. O

Then O
they O
divided O
the O
women B-TER
into O
two O
groups O
: O
some O
of O
us O
were O
sent B-TER
to O
the O
right O
and O
the O
others O
to O
the O
left O
. O

After O
that O
, O
we O
went O
to O
the O
bath O
where O
our O
heads O
were O
shaven O
and O
we O
got O
rags O
in O
return O
for O
our O
clothes B-TER
. O

Our O
better O
shoes B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
housed O
in O
camp B-TER
C. O
One O
thousand O
of O
us O
stayed B-TER
in O
one O
block O
and O
12 O
of O
us O
on O
one O
bunk O
. O

The O
wake O
- O
up O
call O
was O
at O
3 O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
then O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
, O
which O
sometimes O
lasted O
as O
long O
as O
three O
or O
four O
hours O
. O

We O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
area O
until O
the O
numbers O
did O
not O
match O
. O

Afterwards O
we O
went O
to O
the O
block O
totally O
exhausted O
and O
we O
got O
some O
plain O
coffee B-TER
. O

We O
got O
half O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
at O
noon O
in O
large O
pots O
. O

Spoons O
and O
plates O
were O
unknown O
there O
and O
therefore O
12 O
of O
us O
had O
to O
drink B-TER
from O
the O
same O
pot O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

We O
got O
bread B-TER
only O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Then O
we O
had O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
at O
least O
for O
two O
hours O
and O
the O
Zulage B-TER
was O
distributed O
only O
after O
that O
. O

Selections B-TER
began O
about O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
Berta B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
in O
August O
and O
I O
worked O
there O
until O
November O
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
very O
hard O
, O
but O
the O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
better O
there O
and O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
line O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
. O

Later O
camp B-TER
C I-TER
was O
disbanded O
and O
so O
was O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

Then O
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
labourers B-TER
transport I-TER
in O
camp B-TER
D I-TER
. O

One O
thousand O
of O
us O
went O
out O
regularly O
to O
a O
workplace B-TER
that O
was O
eight O
kilometres O
away O
to O
perform O
earthwork O
. O

It O
was O
very O
hard O
; O
we O
worked B-TER
from O
7 O
am O
to O
3 O
pm O
. O

We O
got O
food B-TER
only O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

We O
suffered O
a O
lot O
from O
the O
weather B-TER
. O

We O
often O
had O
to O
march O
and O
to O
work B-TER
in O
mud B-TER
and I-TER
rain I-TER
in O
our O
bad O
shoes B-TER
. O

We O
passed O
the O
crematorium B-TER
every O
day O
. O

In O
December O
we O
saw O
it O
being O
demolished O
. O

Meanwhile O
I O
got O
injured O
at O
work B-TER
: O
a O
tram O
hit O
my O
leg O
and O
I O
was O
lying B-TER
ill I-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

My O
leg O
still O
hurts O
. O

They O
set O
me O
off O
for O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
with O
a O
transport B-TER
on O
January O
1 O
. O

I O
, O
the O
aforementioned O
Jolán B-PER
Bleier I-PER
, O
was O
selected B-TER
on O
September O
15 O
and O
taken O
to O
Weisswasser B-LOC
with O
a O
labourer B-TER
’s I-TER
transport I-TER
of O
300 O
. O

We O
were O
travelling O
for O
two O
days O
; O
55 O
of O
us O
were O
in O
a O
freight O
car O
. O

We O
got O
one O
third O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
Zulage O
for O
provisions O
as O
well O
as O
clean O
clothes B-TER
and O
better O
shoes B-TER
. O

In O
Weisswasser B-LOC
we O
stayed B-TER
in O
rooms O
: O
12 O
persons O
in O
each O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
in O
an O
armament O
factory B-TER
; O
we O
went O
out O
to O
work B-TER
in O
groups O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
very O
hard O
for O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

The O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
scarce O
and O
therefore O
we O
ate O
even O
potato B-TER
peels I-TER
and O
other O
vegetables B-TER
from O
the O
garbage O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
there O
until O
February O
2 O
, O
when O
we O
were O
set O
off O
on O
foot O
. O

After O
walking O
for O
two O
days O
, O
we O
were O
entrained B-TER
. O

Fifty O
of O
us O
were O
put O
into O
one O
car O
and O
taken O
to O
Horneburg B-LOC
on O
a O
five O
- O
day O
journey O
. O

We O
were O
given O
half O
a O
loaf B-TER
of I-TER
bread I-TER
and O
some O
Zulage B-TER
for O
provisions O
. O

Just O
like O
in O
Weisswasser B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
working B-TER
in O
an O
armament O
factory B-TER
for O
five O
weeks O
. O

However O
, O
we O
had O
a O
much O
stricter O
commander O
, O
an O
Unterscharführer B-TER
, O
who O
beat B-TER
us I-TER
severely O
for O
the O
slightest O
offence O
. O

Even O
very O
young O
girls B-TER
were O
sometimes O
sentenced O
for O
25 B-TER
strokes I-TER
. O

If O
we O
queued O
up O
for O
another O
helping O
of O
food B-TER
at O
lunch O
and O
he O
noticed O
that O
, O
he O
beat O
and O
kicked O
us O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
avoid O
him O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
being O
badly O
wounded O
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
a O
transport B-TER
once O
again O
on O
April O
13 O
. O

After O
two O
days O
of O
travel O
we O
arrived O
in O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

I O
met O
my O
sister B-TER
, O
Berta B-PER
Bleier I-PER
there O
two O
days O
before O
liberation B-TER
. O

She O
was O
working B-TER
hard O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
shortly O
after O
we O
met O
, O
she O
fell O
ill B-TER
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

The O
English B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
on O
April O
15 O
, O
but O
the O
kitchen B-TER
continued O
to O
operate O
afterwards O
. O

From O
there O
we O
went O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
and O
then O
to O
Zelle B-LOC
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
four O
weeks O
and O
after O
that O
we O
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
via O
Pilsen B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Our O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
as O
soon O
as O
our O
family B-TER
is O
reunited O
, O
which O
we O
hope O
for O
, O
we O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to I-TER
Palestine B-LOC
