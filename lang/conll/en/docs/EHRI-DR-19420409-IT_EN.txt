Re O
: O
Jewish O
question O
The O
coldness O
with O
which O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Catholic O
press B-TER
has O
greeted O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
action I-TER
of O
Minister O
of O
Interior O
Mach B-PER
is O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Catholic O
population B-TER
which O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
provinces O
, O
feels B-TER
no I-TER
ill I-TER
will O
towards O
Jews B-TER
and O
because O
of O
their O
meekness O
and O
religious O
upbringing O
disagrees O
with O
the O
violent O
methods O
used O
by O
the O
men O
carrying O
out O
the O
expulsion O
decrees O
. O

There O
have O
even O
been O
instances O
in O
which O
local O
authorities O
have O
not O
carried O
out O
or O
carried O
out O
only O
partially O
the O
ministerial O
orders O
. O

As O
many O
as O
three O
prefects O
have O
been O
deposed O
or O
recalled O
and O
subjected O
to O
an O
enquiry O
. O

Church B-TER
authorities O
have O
also O
objected O
to O
the O
methods O
employed O
. O

It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
the O
Minister O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
to O
the O
Vatican B-LOC
has O
been O
here O
, O
and O
there O
have O
been O
rumours O
about O
a O
note O
from O
the O
Secretariat O
of O
State O
to O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
Legation O
. O

There O
has O
indeed O
been O
such O
a O
step O
and O
the O
Chargé O
d’Affaires O
of O
the O
Holy O
See O
here O
has O
repeatedly O
seen O
the O
Prime B-PER
Minister I-PER
and O
Minister O
for O
Foreign O
Affairs O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
have O
been O
critical O
voices O
against O
Mach B-PER
within O
the O
Government B-TER
itself O
, O
coming O
from O
his O
colleagues O
of O
the O
Slovakian B-ORG
people I-ORG
’s I-ORG
party I-ORG
Nonetheless O
, O
the O
forced B-TER
exodus I-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
has O
continued O
and O
continues O
still O
. O

It O
is O
illegal O
, O
as O
no O
law O
authorizing O
it O
exists O
. O

There O
is O
– O
for O
now O
– O
only O
a O
bill B-TER
approved O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
by O
the O
Council O
of O
Minister O
which O
has O
still O
to O
be O
submitted O
to O
Parliament O
. O

The O
full O
powers O
granted O
by O
Parliament O
to O
the O
Government B-TER
in O
1940 O
to O
proceed O
against O
Jews B-TER
can O
not O
possibly O
apply O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
exodus O
. O

As O
I O
have O
learned O
from O
Minister O
Mach B-PER
himself O
, O
of O
the O
90,000 O
Jews B-TER
who O
were O
in O
Slovakia B-LOC
on O
25th O
March O
last O
( O
in O
1939 O
there O
were O
120,000 O
, O
30,000 O
of O
whom O
have O
voluntarily O
left O
the O
country O
after O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
independent O
Slovak O
State O
) O
, O
13,000 O
have O
been O
deported B-TER
these O
past O
weeks O
to O
the O
Katowice B-LOC
area O
and O
to O
the O
General B-LOC
Governorate I-LOC
and O
those O
remaining O
will O
follow O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
6 O
months O
. O

Mach B-PER
told O
me O
“ O
The O
Jews B-TER
were O
dominating O
our O
economy B-TER
” O
, O
and O
ended O
by O
saying O
that O
to O
remedy O
such O
a O
state O
of O
affairs O
, O
the O
time O
for O
half O
measures O
is O
over O
. O

When O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
having O
acted O
because O
forced O
to O
do O
so O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
the O
Minister B-PER
of I-PER
Interior I-PER
declared O
to O
the O
press B-TER
, O
as O
reported O
with O
Cable O
no O
. O

1095/245 O
from O
27th O
March O
, O
that O
the O
expulsion O
of O
Jews B-TER
had O
been O
decided O
“ O
spontaneously O
and O
with O
full O
persuasion O
” O
. O

I O
have O
been O
told O
by O
the O
German B-TER
Minister O
here O
that O
his O
Government B-TER
had O
not O
used O
any O
pressure O
but O
had O
simply O
made O
a O
suggestion O
that O
had O
been O
accepted O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
the O
President B-PER
of I-PER
the I-PER
Republic I-PER
has O
done O
his O
utmost O
to O
mitigate O
the O
harshness O
of O
the O
methods O
employed O
for O
the O
exodus B-TER
and O
made O
use O
, O
despite O
a O
strong O
opposition B-TER
from O
the O
Prime B-PER
Minister I-PER
himself O
, O
of O
the O
right O
to O
discriminate O
granted O
him O
by O
the O
“ O
Jewish O
Code O
” O
in O
order O
to O
save O
a O
great O
many O
persons O
from O
expulsion O
. O

Clearly O
, O
if O
President B-PER
Tiso I-PER
has O
not O
done O
more O
and O
has O
even O
prevented O
a O
press B-TER
controversy O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
from O
breaking O
out O
( O
all O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
press B-TER
, O
belatedly O
, O
were O
two O
critical O
articles O
in O
the O
Catholic O
newspapers B-TER
Slovak O
and O
Slovenska O
Pravda O
) O
, O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
finds O
himself O
unable O
to O
oppose O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Reich B-TER
, O
which O
has O
in O
Tuka B-PER
and O
in O
Mach B-PER
, O
particularly O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
, O
willing O
and O
convinced O
executors O
. O

It O
is O
also O
likely O
that O
Monsignor O
Tiso B-PER
judges O
that O
under O
any O
circumstances O
he O
can O
be O
more O
useful O
to O
his O
people O
in O
the O
presidential O
chair O
than O
elsewhere O
. O
