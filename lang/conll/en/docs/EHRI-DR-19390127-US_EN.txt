1938 O
, O
which O
in O
the O
last O
paragraph O
on O
page O

mentions O
the O
growing O
tendency O
among O
certain O
politicians O
to O
enact O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER
, O
and O
to O
report O
that O
this O
movement B-TER
is O
gaining O
momentum O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
present O
budget O
session O
of O
the O
Parliament B-ORG
early O
in O
December O
, O
Deputy O

had O
worked O
out O
a O
concrete O
proposal O
embodying O

Jewish I-TER

which O

wished O
to O
present O
. O

[ O
… O

Deputy O
Stoch B-PER
project O
is O
based O
not O
so O
much O
on O
racial B-TER
but O
on O
religious B-TER
principles I-TER
and O
proposes O
the O
extension O
of O
only O
temporary O
citizenship O
[ O
sic O
] O
to O
all O
professed O
Jews B-TER
, O
including O
even O
those O
who O
changed O
their O
religion B-TER
as O
far O
back O
as O
1918 O
. O

Under O
his O
project O
these O
temporary O
citizens O
would O
lose B-TER
: O
Their O
political B-TER
rights I-TER
, O
Employment B-TER
in I-TER
public I-TER
service I-TER
institutions I-TER
and O
schools B-TER
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
Jewish B-TER
private I-TER
schools I-TER
, O
Title O
to O

, O
Right O

Furthermore O

Full O

by O
Jews B-TER
converted B-TER
to I-TER
Christianity I-TER
before O
the O
restoration O
of O
Poland B-LOC
’s I-LOC
independence O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Jews B-TER
having O
special O
merits O
because O
of O
their O
service B-TER
during I-TER
the I-TER
war I-TER

of O
January O
24 O
, O
1938 O
( O
Anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
Legislation I-TER
) O
, O
it O
is O
still O
true O
, O
as O
was O
then O
the O
case O
, O
that O
the O
Polish B-LOC
Government B-TER
feels O
that O
the O
time O
is O
not O
ripe O
yet O
for O
the O
enactment O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
legislation I-TER
as O
such O
. O

However O
, O
the O
significant O
point O
in O
this O
report O
is O
that O
the O
tendency O
and O
trend O
of O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
is O
in O
that O
direction O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
Government O
still O
endeavors O
to O
side O
- O
step O
the O
main O
issue O
, O
but O
working O
through O
OZON B-ORG
, O
continues O
its O
policy B-TER
of O
guarded O
discrimination B-TER
, O
limiting O
Jewish B-TER
activity O
wherever O
possible O
without O
direct O
racial B-TER
reference O
. O

Temporizing O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
the O
Government B-TER
hopes O
to O
avoid O
hostile O
foreign B-TER
censure I-TER
, O
placate O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
circles O
here O
, O
and O
not O
to O
arouse O
Jewish O
apprehension O
or O
enmity O
. O

The O
Government B-TER
is O
under O
no O
illusion O
, O
however O
, O
but O
that O
eventually O
this O
issue O
will O
have O
to O
be O
faced O
squarely O
. O
