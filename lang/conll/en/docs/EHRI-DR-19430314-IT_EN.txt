Measures B-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
of O
Thessaloniki B-LOC
. O

The O
Jews O
of O
Thessaloniki O
have O
been O
entirely O
excluded B-TER
from I-TER
any I-TER
activity I-TER
and O
have O
for O
over O
a O
week O
now O
been O
confined O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
unable O
to B-TER
leave I-TER
it O
for O
any O
reason O
whatsoever O
. O

Their O
entire O
property B-TER
has I-TER
been I-TER
seized I-TER
and O
will O
be O
managed O
through O
fiduciaries B-TER
, O
who O
will O
have O
to O
deposit O
the O
proceeds O
from O
sales O
in O
a O
special O
blocked O
account O
. O

So O
far O
it O
is O
not O
precisely O
known O
if O
part O
of O
the O
sums O
thus O
obtained O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
sustenance O
of O
destitute B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
who O
are O
the O
great O
majority O
. O

Several O
sources O
confirm O
that O
their O
transfer B-TER
to O
Poland B-LOC
should O
start O
anytime O
now O
. O

German B-TER
authorities I-TER
have O
requested O
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
a O
list O
of O
120 O
prominent O
persons O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
hostages O
. O

In O
this O
list O
there O
are O
also O
12 O
Italian O
citizens O
of O
Jewish B-TER
race I-TER
who O
, O
together O
with O
the O
others O
, O
were O
summoned O
on O
the O
7th O
inst O
. O

to O
the O
Community`s B-TER
premises O
where O
a O
German O
officer O
gave O
a O
short O
speech O
and O
explained O
that O
they O
would O
answer O
with O
their O
own O
persons O
for O
any O
accident O
or O
act B-TER
of I-TER
sabotage I-TER
that O
might O
occur O
. O

He O
added O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
his O
duty O
to O
intern O
them O
at O
once O
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
, O
but O
that O
due O
to O
the O
assurances O
given O
by O
the O
Chief O
Rabbi B-TER
he O
would O
let O
them O
stay O
free O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

The O
said O
prominent O
persons O
are O
also O
required O
to O
provide O
out O
of O
their O
own O
means O
for O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
poorer O
Jews B-TER
. O

I O
have O
approached O
the O
Befehlshaber B-TER
and O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
his O
assurance O
that O
the O
Italian O
citizens O
will O
be O
removed O
from O
said O
list O
and O
we O
reached O
an O
understanding O
that O
they O
will O
no O
longer O
comply O
with O
the B-TER
instructions I-TER
and I-TER
the I-TER
orders I-TER
they O
should O
still O
receive O
through O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
. O

Due O
to O
the O
zeal O
displayed O
by O
the O
offices O
in O
charge O
of O
carrying O
out O
the O
adopted B-TER
measures I-TER
, O
I O
find O
myself O
compelled O
all O
the O
time O
to O
undertake O
steps O
to O
prevent O
our O
fellow O
- O
citizens O
from O
being O
hampered O
in O
their O
usual O
commercial O
activity O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only O
inevitable O
repercussions O
of O
a O
very O
limited O
and O
modest O
relevance O
. O

The O
sudden O
removal O
from O
town O
life O
of O
over O
50 O
thousand O
people O
, O
who O
for O
centuries O
had O
continuously O
been O
engaged O
in O
important B-TER
activities I-TER
, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
serious O
inconveniences O
. O

A O
great O
many O
services O
that O
were O
provided O
almost O
exclusively B-TER
by I-TER
Jews I-TER
are O
now O
missing O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
commodities O
has O
increased O
sharply O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
the O
local O
press B-TER
has O
been O
clamouring O
for O
severe O
steps O
against O
the O
Greek B-LOC
merchants O
who O
exploit O
the O
present O
moment O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
closing O
of O
the O
great O
many O
Jewish B-TER
shops I-TER
, O
to O
the O
diminished O
traffic O
in O
the O
streets O
and O
to O
the O
scarcity O
of O
public O
in O
cinemas O
and O
in O
restaurants O
- O
caf√©s O
, O
the O
town O
has O
acquired O
a O
look O
pervaded O
by O
a O
sense O
of O
sadness O
. O

The O
Greek B-LOC
element O
, O
except O
for O
the O
merchants O
who O
have O
seen O
their O
dreaded O
competitors O
disappear O
, O
displays O
no O
enthusiasm O
for O
all O
that O
is O
being O
done O
, O
quite O
the O
opposite O
, O
they O
worry O
about O
the O
immediate O
and O
future O
consequences O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
who O
had O
been O
issued B-TER
by I-TER
us I-TER
with I-TER
a I-TER
pass I-TER
have O
been O
prevented O
by O
German B-TER
authorities O
from O
reaching O
our O
zone O
. O

I O
have O
enquired O
to O
see O
if O
some O
exception O
might O
not O
be O
granted O
for O
the O
most O
serious O
cases O
, O
but O
have O
received O
a O
negative B-TER
answer I-TER
, O
in O
fact O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
would O
request O
that O
those O
who O
had O
already O
moved O
into O
our O
territory O
be O
returned O
to O
them O
