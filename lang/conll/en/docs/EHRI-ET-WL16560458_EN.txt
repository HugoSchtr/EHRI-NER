Ursula B-PER
Finke I-PER
, O
Berlin B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lichtenberg I-LOC
I O
was O
born O
on O
30.6.1923 O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
as O
a O
full O
Jew O
, O
daughter O
of O
the O
businessman B-TER
Julius B-PER
Finke I-PER
and O
his O
wife B-TER
Ella B-PER
, O
nee O
Kallmann B-PER
. O

After O
spending O
the O
first O
ten O
years O
of O
my O
life O
growing O
up O
without O
a O
care O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
year O
1933 O
arrived O
and O
Hitler B-PER
came O
to O
power O
. O

There O
was O
a O
polling O
station O
in O
the O
building B-TER
in O
which O
we O
were O
living O
, O
and O
unfortunately O
on O
polling O
day O
in O
1933 O
I O
was O
playing O
near O
the O
window O
in O
one O
of O
our O
rooms B-TER
with O
some O
quark O
. O

I O
was O
cooking O
like O
children B-TER
used O
to O
do O
. O

How O
it O
came O
about O
that O
I O
let O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
this O
stuff O
drip O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
I O
still O
can O
not O
explain O
to O
this O
day O
, O
however O
that O
is O
what O
happened O
, O
and O
just O
a O
few O
minutes O
later O
there O
was O
a O
ring O
on O
our O
doorbell O
. O

My O
father O
opened O
the O
door O
and O
there O
in O
front O
of O
him O
stood O
a O
Storm B-TER
Trooper I-TER
, O
who O
immediately O
rushed O
into O
the O
apartment B-TER
right O
across O
the O
room B-TER
to O
the O
open O
window O
, O
whistled O
down O
below O
and O
asked O
: O
Was O
it O
here O
? O
to O
which O
the O
answer O
came O
that O
it O
was O
. O

At O
this O
point O
I O
should O
mention O
that O
a O
Storm B-TER
Trooper I-TER
with O
an O
advertising O
poster O
had O
been O
standing O
outside O
the O
door O
of O
the O
polling O
station O
all O
day O
. O

The O
fellow O
in O
our O
apartment B-TER
then O
said O
to O
my O
father O
that O
15 O
drops O
of O
corrosive O
acid O
had O
been O
poured O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
on O
he O
blackmailed O
my O
father O
by O
threatening B-TER
to O
send O
him O
straight O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Six O
months O
later O
we O
moved O
to O
Halensee B-LOC
to O
be O
rid O
of O
the O
fellow O
. O

At O
Easter O
1933 O
I O
was O
due O
to O
move O
to O
the O
Victoria B-TER
- I-TER
Oberlyceum I-TER
, O
after O
having O
spent O
four O
years O
at O
the O
elementary B-TER
school I-TER
. O

As O
we O
did O
not O
know O
at O
first O
whether O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
still O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
the O
senior B-TER
schools I-TER
, O
I O
spent O
a O
month O
of O
the O
new O
school B-TER
year O
still O
in O
the O
elementary B-TER
school I-TER
, O
after O
which O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Margareten B-TER
- I-TER
Lyzeum I-TER
in O
Iffland B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

Here O
there O
were O
approximately O
14 O
of O
us O
Jewish O
girls O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
under O
the O
class B-TER
teacher O
, O
Herr B-TER
Kochanowsky B-PER
the O
senior O
primary B-TER
school I-TER
teacher O
, O
was O
so O
poor O
, O
that O
in O
October O
I O
begged O
my O
parents O
to O
send O
me O
to O
a O
Jewish B-TER
school I-TER
, O
which O
is O
what O
they O
did O
. O

As O
a O
result O
I O
then O
started O
going O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
Middle I-TER
School I-TER
at O
27 B-LOC
, I-LOC
Grosse I-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
had O
lost O
his O
job B-TER
as O
company O
secretary O
of O
a O
department O
store O
, O
as O
the O
Jewish O
proprietor O
gave O
up O
the O
business B-TER
. O

So O
, O
like O
many O
Jews O
, O
my O
father O
was O
unemployed O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
find O
work B-TER
. O

He O
then O
did O
various O
temporary O
jobs B-TER
and O
agency B-TER
work I-TER
; O
when O
that O
was O
no O
longer O
available O
either O
, O
he O
worked B-TER
on O
a O
voluntary O
basis O
for O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
, O
until O
in O
1937 O
he O
got O
a O
permanent O
job B-TER
as O
a O
tax B-TER
consultant O
for O
those O
wanting O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

As O
everyone O
was O
thinking O
about O
emigrating B-TER
, O
my O
parents O
took O
me O
out O
of O
school B-TER
early O
, O
in O
October O
1937 O
, O
so O
that O
I O
, O
like O
my O
brother O
Hans B-PER
who O
was O
born O
in O
1920 O
, O
and O
who O
was O
already O
training O
as O
an O
electrical O
engineer O
, O
could O
learn O
a O
trade B-TER
. O

As O
I O
was O
quite O
skilful O
, O
my O
parents O
sent O
me O
to O
train O
in O
a O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
, O
where O
I O
began O
to O
learn B-TER
dressmaking B-TER
. O

The O
head O
of O
the O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
was O
also O
a O
Jewish O
lady B-TER
, O
and O
so O
in O
January O
1939 O
, O
like O
all O
German B-LOC
Jewish O
trades B-TER
people B-TER
she O
had O
to O
close B-TER
the O
business B-TER
. O

I O
then O
went O
to O
a O
fashion B-TER
school I-TER
and O
learned O
cutting O
. O

By O
the O
time O
this O
course O
had O
finished O
, O
Jewish O
girls O
were O
only O
permitted O
to O
go O
into O
service O
, O
and O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
take O
a O
job B-TER
doing O
housework B-TER
in O
a O
Jewish O
guesthouse B-TER
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
we O
had O
been O
given O
notice O
to O
quit O
our O
home B-TER
following O
Kristallnacht B-TER
in O
1938 O
. O

Our O
neighbours O
were O
party B-TER
members I-TER
and O
had O
told O
the O
landlord O
that O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
live O
under O
the O
same O
roof O
as O
Jews O
. O

My O
mother O
once O
went O
to O
speak O
to O
our O
neighbour O
and O
asked O
her O
what O
she O
had O
against O
us O
, O
whereupon O
the O
neighbour O
replied O
that O
she O
had O
nothing O
against O
us O
herself O
, O
but O
the O
Führer O
had O
had O
bad O
experiences O
with O
Jews O
! O
Until O
1st O
January O
1940 O
I O
had O
the O
great O
good O
fortune O
to O
have O
had O
a O
place O
arranged O
for O
me O
through O
a O
friend O
in O
a O
fashion B-TER
house I-TER
, O
which O
a O
Jewish O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
was O
allowed O
to O
continue O
to O
run O
; O
she O
registered B-TER
me O
as O
employed B-TER
to O
do O
housework B-TER
, O
although O
I O
did O
do O
sewing O
after O
all O
, O
so O
that O
in O
my O
job B-TER
I O
was O
able O
to O
complete O
the O
part O
of O
my O
apprenticeship O
that O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
finished O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
lady B-TER
was O
deported B-TER
on O
the O
first O
Jewish O
transport B-TER
in O
1941 O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
from O
that O
time O
onwards O
, O
Jews O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Jewish O
units O
into O
which O
they O
had O
been O
conscripted O
, O
therefore O
no O
longer O
in O
private O
employment B-TER
. O

In O
May O
1939 O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Community I-TER
allocated O
us O
an O
apartment B-TER
with O
two O
rooms B-TER
in O
a O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
house O
- O
in O
a O
tenement O
with O
a O
W.C. B-TER
on O
the O
stairs O
. O

We O
were O
just O
pleased O
not O
to O
have O
to O
share O
with O
other O
people B-TER
, O
which O
with O
4 O
of O
us O
going O
out O
to O
work B-TER
would O
have O
been O
particularly O
difficult O
. O

On O
19th O
September O
1941 O
the O
law B-TER
was O
passed O
which O
stated O
that O
every O
Jew O
was O
obliged O
to O
wear O
a O
Yellow O
Star O
of O
David O
. O

Then O
Jews O
were O
no B-TER
longer I-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
use I-TER
public I-TER
transport I-TER
or O
visit B-TER
places I-TER
of O
cultural B-TER
interest I-TER
etc O
. O

Typewriters O
, O
radios B-TER
, O
all O
electrical O
equipment O
, O
even O
irons O
, O
had O
to O
be O
surrendered B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
jewellery O
etc O
. O

This O
latter O
had O
already O
taken O
place O
after O
Kristallnacht B-TER
. O

After O
I O
lost O
my O
job B-TER
with O
the O
Jewish O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
, O
where O
in O
addition O
to O
me O
a O
certain O
Ruth B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
, O
a O
Turkish B-LOC
Jew O
, O
worked B-TER
with O
whom O
I O
had O
become O
very O
friendly O
, O
I O
was O
given O
compulsory O
work B-TER
at O
Moeller O
, O
a O
firm B-TER
manufacturing O
ready O
– O
to O
- O
wear O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
coats B-TER
in O
Schützen B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

In O
this O
Jewish O
unit O
about O
30 O
- O
50 O
Jewish O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
worked B-TER
( O
today O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
say O
exactly O
how O
many O
) O
. O

It O
was O
piecework O
, O
and O
about O
3.75 O
marks B-TER
were O
paid O
for O
a O
completed O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
coat B-TER
. O

The O
deportations B-TER
were O
still O
going O
on O
and O
so O
the O
time O
came O
when O
nearly O
every O
day O
one O
colleague O
or O
another O
was O
missing O
and O
did O
not O
come O
back O
. O

By O
now O
it O
was O
February O
1943 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
, O
like O
my O
mother O
, O
had O
been O
given O
compulsory B-TER
work I-TER
in O
a O
factory B-TER
. O

They O
earned O
extremely O
little O
; O
food B-TER
, O
which O
we O
had O
to O
buy O
on O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
, O
was O
so O
expensive O
, O
that O
we O
could O
barely O
afford O
it O
. O

With O
ration B-TER
cards I-TER
we O
got O
neither O
meat B-TER
nor O
butter B-TER
, O
nor O
fish B-TER
nor O
white B-TER
bread I-TER
. O

Several O
of O
the O
shopkeepers O
gave O
my O
mother O
something O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
in O
return O
for O
which O
she O
gave O
them O
clothing B-TER
or O
other O
things O
from O
the O
household O
to O
show O
her O
gratitude O
. O

We O
had O
had O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
most O
of O
our O
furnishings O
when O
we O
moved O
from O
Halensee B-LOC
into O
the O
one O
and O
a O
half O
room O
apartment B-TER
in O
1939 O
. O

As O
deportation B-TER
was O
a O
daily O
threat O
for O
us O
too O
, O
we O
trembled O
at O
each O
heavy O
footstep O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
and O
her O
parents O
put O
pressure O
on O
me O
to O
start O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
, O
because O
as O
Turks B-LOC
the O
Jewish O
Laws B-TER
did O
not O
apply O
to O
them O
at O
present O
, O
to O
move O
in O
with O
them O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
constant O
pressure O
, O
with O
my O
nerves O
in O
a O
complete O
state O
of O
collapse O
as O
separation B-TER
from O
my O
parents O
seemed O
to O
me O
almost O
impossible O
, O
on O
25 O
February O
1943 O
I O
pulled O
myself O
together O
and O
I O
moved O
to O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
who O
were O
also O
illegally B-TER
sheltering I-TER
a O
girl O
friend O
of O
their O
son O
as O
well O
as O
me O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
could O
still O
be O
separated B-TER
from O
my O
parents O
by O
deportation B-TER
and O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

On O
27th O
February O
, O
a O
Sunday O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Fabrik O
- O
Aktion O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
took O
place O
, O
during O
which O
every O
Jew O
was O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
factories B-TER
, O
loaded O
onto O
lorries O
and O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

My O
parents O
were O
among O
them O
. O

My O
brother O
, O
who O
had O
just O
had O
his O
appendix B-TER
out O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Hospital I-TER
, O
was O
also O
deported B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
two O
weeks O
later O
. O

As O
a O
qualified O
electrical O
engineer O
he O
was O
segregated O
with O
different O
workmates B-TER
, O
who O
had O
all O
already O
been O
doing O
compulsory O
work B-TER
together O
at O
Siemens B-ORG
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
had O
to O
put O
electrical O
installations O
in O
the O
villas B-TER
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
officials B-TER
there O
and O
maintain O
the O
power O
lines O
etc O
under O
the O
worst O
possible O
conditions O
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-LOC
approached O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
moved O
away O
. O

For O
ten O
days O
my O
brother O
lived O
off O
melted O
snow O
in O
a O
goods O
train B-TER
with O
80 O
people B-TER
in O
one O
wagon B-TER
, O
dressed B-TER
only O
in O
his O
drill O
suit B-TER
; O
he O
then O
came O
via O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
and O
Flossenbürg B-LOC
to O
Belsen B-LOC
, O
where O
, O
half B-TER
- I-TER
dead I-TER
, O
he O
was O
then O
released B-TER
and O
, O
praise O
God B-TER
, O
survived B-TER
. O

Some O
days O
after O
the O
Fabrik B-TER
- O
Aktion B-TER
a O
colleague O
of O
my O
mother O
’s O
, O
who O
was O
in O
a O
mixed B-TER
marriage I-TER
and O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
with O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
brought O
a O
card B-TER
which O
my O
mother O
had O
thrown O
from O
a O
goods O
wagon B-TER
travelling O
through O
Upper B-LOC
Silesia I-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
on O
which O
she O
had O
written O
a O
few O
lines O
. O

A O
lady B-TER
had O
found O
the O
card B-TER
in O
the O
open O
countryside O
and O
had O
put O
it O
in O
an O
envelope B-TER
and O
added O
a O
few O
lines O
to O
say O
that O
the O
card B-TER
had O
been O
thrown O
from O
a O
train B-TER
in O
this O
way O
and O
had O
undersigned O
it O
with O
the O
words O
: O
A O
woman O
, O
who O
still O
thinks O
like O
a O
human O
being O
. O

No O
further O
indications O
of O
life O
came O
from O
either O
my O
mother O
or O
my O
father O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
’s I-PER
aunt O
, O
who O
had O
also O
been O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
had O
been O
recognised O
and O
arrested B-TER
by O
an O
informer B-TER
( O
a O
certain O
lawyer B-TER
Jacob O
) O
, O
had O
had O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
’ I-PER
address O
on O
her O
, O
and O
so O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
correctly O
assumed O
that O
illegals O
were O
to O
be O
found O
there O
. O

One O
day O
– O
it O
must O
have O
been O
in O
July O
1943 O
- O
they O
burst O
into O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
’ I-PER
home B-TER
, O
the O
cleaner O
was O
wiping O
the O
front O
door O
to O
the O
apartment B-TER
, O
and O
found O
not O
only O
me O
but O
also O
the O
girlfriend O
of O
Ori B-PER
Jacobson I-PER
, O
a O
certain O
Sonja B-PER
Weissbrot I-PER
. O

This O
latter O
passed O
herself O
off O
as O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
neighbour O
( O
Christin O
, O
who O
knew O
about O
us O
) O
, O
and O
she O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
because O
the O
neighbour O
stated O
that O
she O
was O
her O
daughter O
. O

It O
was O
Kommissar O
Wenzel B-PER
and O
among O
others O
, O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
who O
then O
dealt O
with O
me O
. O

The O
Jacobsons B-PER
had O
been O
able O
to O
buy O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
on O
the O
quiet O
. O

Thanks O
to O
an O
acquaintance O
who O
had O
only O
one O
Jewish O
and O
three O
Christian B-TER
grandparents O
– O
so O
did O
not O
come O
under O
the O
Jewish O
laws B-TER
– O
I O
still O
had O
these O
with O
me O
in O
her O
name O
, O
to O
use O
as O
possible O
identification B-TER
at O
an O
identity O
check O
, O
as O
I O
had O
no O
other O
identity B-TER
papers I-TER
. O

As O
it O
was O
necessary O
I O
now O
showed O
these O
cards B-TER
and O
said O
I O
was O
the O
acquaintance O
. O

At O
first O
they O
wanted O
to O
take O
me O
with O
them O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
assembly O
point O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
took O
a O
fancy O
to O
me O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
would O
meet O
him O
, O
to O
which O
I O
naturally O
said O
I O
would O
and O
that O
I O
could O
then O
bring O
my O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
with O
me O
and O
, O
oh O
what O
a O
miracle O
, O
they O
did O
not O
take O
me O
with O
them O
, O
but O
ordered O
me O
to O
go O
a O
few O
days O
later O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
with O
my O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
naturally O
. O

I O
told O
the O
girl B-TER
first O
of O
all O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
we O
arranged O
that O
, O
should O
she O
be O
approached O
by O
someone O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
she O
would O
deny O
all O
knowledge O
of O
any O
of O
this O
and O
also O
of O
me O
, O
and O
as O
in O
any O
case O
I O
now O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
did O
not O
approach O
her O
at O
all O
, O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
go O
to O
the O
rendezvous O
with O
the O
informer B-TER
. O

Herr B-TER
Jacobson B-PER
, O
without O
the O
knowledge O
of O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
was O
behind O
us O
all O
the O
time O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
help O
me O
if O
necessary O
. O

We O
met O
as O
arranged O
in O
the O
Alexanderplatz B-LOC
railway B-TER
station O
, O
and O
I O
was O
sure O
of O
only O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
I O
had O
to O
make O
certain O
at O
all O
costs O
that O
the O
fellow O
vouched O
for O
me O
in O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
told O
them O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
the O
identity B-TER
card I-TER
and O
that O
it O
was O
therefore O
not O
necessary O
for O
me O
to O
appear O
there O
. O

The O
fellow O
kept O
on O
and O
on O
at O
me O
and O
told O
me O
that O
his O
wife B-TER
was O
away O
so O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
safe O
to O
go O
to O
his O
apartment B-TER
at O
27 B-LOC
Weissenburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
on O
the O
following O
Sunday O
. O

I O
said O
that O
I O
would O
go O
, O
on O
condition O
that O
I O
did O
not O
need O
to O
go O
to O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
and O
as O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
very O
keen O
on O
me O
, O
he O
agreed O
and O
we O
said O
goodbye O
. O

The O
lass O
was O
not O
bothered O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
on O
my O
account O
, O
thank O
God B-TER
, O
even O
if O
nothing O
would O
have O
happened O
to O
her O
as O
she O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
( O
allegedly O
) O
, O
but O
of O
course O
it O
was O
much O
better O
for O
her O
this O
way O
. O

I O
wrote O
a O
letter B-TER
to O
the O
informer B-TER
saying O
that O
I O
would O
not O
come O
on O
Sunday O
as O
arranged O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
he O
had O
already O
vouched O
for O
me O
. O

To O
my O
great O
misfortune O
however O
, O
some O
days O
later O
this O
girl B-TER
was O
ordered O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
because O
of O
another O
Jewish O
boy O
living B-TER
illegally I-TER
who O
had O
her O
address O
with O
him O
, O
and O
there O
it O
was O
established O
that O
I O
had O
not O
been O
The O
Right O
One O
on O
the O
previous O
occasion O
, O
and O
this O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
I O
therefore O
must O
also O
be O
an O
illegal B-TER
, O
and O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
, O
who O
had O
been O
very O
angry O
that O
I O
had O
stood O
him O
up O
that O
time O
, O
became O
even O
angrier O
still O
that O
I O
had O
got O
away O
from O
him O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
now O
had O
to O
disappear O
immediately O
from O
the O
Jacobson B-PER
family B-TER
. O

The O
Jacobsons B-PER
had O
a O
longstanding O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
I O
had O
met O
at O
birthday O
celebrations O
etc O
, O
and O
who O
in O
the O
meantime O
was O
also O
living B-TER
illegally I-TER
with O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
and O
visited O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
, O
as O
she O
was O
called O
, O
left O
her O
clothes B-TER
with O
my O
friend O
Ruth B-PER
and O
me O
for O
mending O
, O
as O
we O
also O
used O
to O
do O
sewing O
together O
when O
I O
was O
staying B-TER
there O
illegally B-TER
. O

Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
asked O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
one O
day O
where O
she O
had O
her O
mending O
done O
, O
and O
whether O
we O
would O
do O
any O
for O
her O
, O
which O
of O
course O
we O
were O
pleased O
to O
do O
. O

This O
is O
how O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
came O
to O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
heard O
about O
me O
and O
saw O
me O
and O
said O
to O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
, O
before O
I O
had O
even O
started O
thinking O
about O
leaving O
the O
Jacobsons B-PER
, O
that O
she O
would O
take O
me O
in O
straight O
away O
too O
, O
even O
though O
apart O
from O
Lola B-PER
, O
another O
Jewish O
girl B-TER
was O
also O
housed B-TER
at O
the O
Dänes B-PER
. O

The O
question O
as O
to O
where O
I O
should O
go O
was O
now O
becoming O
urgent O
, O
and O
we O
got O
in O
touch O
with O
Lola B-PER
and O
asked O
whether O
the O
Dänes B-PER
would O
now O
stand O
by O
their O
word O
and O
take O
me O
in O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
unbelievably O
they O
did O
take O
me O
in O
as O
well O
, O
even O
though O
I O
was O
the O
third O
one O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
lived O
in O
a O
detached O
house O
in O
Conradshöhe O
, O
a O
villa O
suburb O
of O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
in O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
's I-PER
parents O
’ O
house B-TER
; O
they O
were O
also O
in O
agreement O
with O
this O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
owned O
three O
lending O
libraries B-TER
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
worked B-TER
in O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
Dänes B-PER
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
employed B-TER
in O
the O
second O
one O
, O
and O
I O
said O
I O
would O
. O

Lola B-PER
’s I-PER
shop O
was O
at O
the O
station O
on O
Frankfurter B-LOC
( O
now O
Stalin O
) O
Allee O
. O

The O
shop O
in O
which O
I O
worked B-TER
was O
in O
Moabit B-LOC
, O
an O
area O
in O
which O
I O
was O
not O
known O
. O

As O
the O
bombing B-TER
was O
becoming O
increasingly O
heavy O
, O
many O
people B-TER
were O
spending O
the O
night O
in O
the O
suburbs O
to O
escape B-TER
the O
dangers O
; O
it O
certainly O
was O
not O
the O
case O
that O
we O
used O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
each O
day O
. O

In O
the O
suburbs O
we O
said O
that O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
city O
and O
were O
registered B-TER
there O
and O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
the O
suburbs O
because O
of O
the O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
, O
and O
in O
the O
city O
we O
said O
that O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
suburbs O
, O
so O
that O
no O
one O
would O
become O
suspicious O
. O

The O
Däne B-PER
had O
left O
me O
a O
library B-TER
card O
and O
a O
work B-TER
book O
which O
had O
belonged O
to O
a O
former O
Christian B-TER
employee O
, O
who O
was O
still O
registered B-TER
with O
them O
. O

( O
This O
employee O
, O
who O
had O
a O
child B-TER
, O
was O
quite O
happy O
about O
this O
, O
as O
otherwise O
she O
would O
have O
been O
given O
compulsory B-TER
work I-TER
elsewhere O
, O
and O
in O
this O
way O
she O
was O
still O
regarded O
as O
being O
employed B-TER
) O
. O

So O
, O
in O
August O
1943 O
I O
came O
to O
the O
Däne B-PER
. O

Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
and O
Frau B-TER
Däne B-PER
trained O
me O
and O
, O
as O
I O
had O
read O
a O
lot O
in O
any O
case O
, O
working B-TER
in O
the O
library B-TER
presented O
me O
with O
few O
difficulties O
and O
much O
pleasure O
. O

People B-TER
were O
happy O
to O
be O
served O
by O
me O
, O
I O
reserved O
good O
books B-TER
for O
them O
, O
and O
if O
I O
went O
shopping O
with O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
’s I-TER
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
more O
of O
everything O
that O
was O
on O
all O
the O
cards B-TER
, O
and O
even O
here O
and O
there O
something O
extra O
, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
also O
contribute O
something O
to O
the O
household O
budget O
. O

Herr B-TER
Däne B-PER
had O
also O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
contacts O
so O
that O
I O
did O
not O
have O
to O
go O
hungry B-TER
. O

Except O
for O
the O
constant O
persecution B-TER
mania O
from O
which O
I O
suffered O
, O
the O
year O
passed O
quite O
well O
in O
this O
way O
until O
8th O
August O
1944 O
. O

After O
closing O
the O
shop O
I O
would O
always O
meet O
Lola B-PER
Alexander I-PER
at O
the O
Gesundbrunnen B-LOC
station I-LOC
to O
go O
together O
with O
her O
on O
the O
only O
tram O
, O
number O
28 O
or O
128 O
, O
which O
went O
from O
there O
to O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
Däne B-PER
. O

We O
always O
met O
at O
the O
circle O
line O
barrier O
. O

At O
this O
time O
of O
day O
there O
was O
always O
a O
terrible O
crush O
. O

Among O
hundreds O
of O
people B-TER
, O
no O
one O
could O
go O
forwards O
or O
backwards O
, O
on O
this O
particular O
day O
someone O
grabbed O
my O
arm O
– O
Behrend B-PER
the O
informer B-TER
. O

I O
froze O
. O

He O
led O
me O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
past O
Lola B-PER
who O
was O
also O
frozen O
to O
the O
spot O
, O
but O
who O
he O
did O
not O
know O
, O
thank O
God B-TER
. O

As O
I O
had O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards B-TER
with O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
names O
with O
me O
in O
my O
handbag O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
throw O
these O
away O
so O
that O
Lola B-PER
could O
pick O
them O
up O
, O
but O
Behrend B-PER
only O
said O
, O
Pick O
them O
up O
! O
He O
pushed O
me O
along O
the O
passage O
there O
, O
gripping O
my O
arm O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

I O
begged O
him O
to O
let O
me O
go O
, O
as O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
gain O
from O
seizing O
me O
, O
but O
he O
only O
answered O
with O
an O
icy O
, O
No O
! O
Platforms O
for O
trains B-TER
in O
all O
different O
directions O
lead O
off O
the O
passage O
I O
mentioned O
. O

He O
pulled O
me O
onto O
the O
last O
platform O
, O
where O
he O
met O
a O
man B-TER
, O
who O
I O
later O
learned O
was O
a O
certain O
Kommissar O
Tietze B-PER
. O

As O
he O
had O
no O
idea O
who O
was O
coming O
with O
Behrend B-PER
, O
this O
latter O
was O
obliged O
to O
tell O
him O
about O
me O
. O

He O
therefore O
let O
me O
go O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
said O
, O
If O
you O
carry O
on O
making O
a O
fuss O
, O
I O
’ll O
slap O
you O
so O
hard O
that O
you O
’ll O
fly O
into O
the O
wall O
! O
Full O
of O
despair O
, O
I O
took O
stock O
of O
my O
life O
and O
knew O
, O
that O
they O
would O
first O
beat O
me O
half O
to O
death B-TER
and O
then O
pack O
me O
off O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

As O
I O
had O
sworn O
to O
myself O
not O
to O
let O
these O
dogs O
kill B-TER
me O
, O
and O
as O
well O
was O
feverishly O
working O
out O
how O
I O
could O
destroy O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards O
, O
the O
approaching O
S B-TER
- I-TER
Bahn I-TER
train I-TER
appeared O
to O
be O
my O
salvation O
, O
and O
with O
one O
jump O
I O
threw O
myself O
under O
the O
train B-TER
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
when O
someone O
called O
, O
Turn O
off O
the O
current O
. O

Lying O
under O
the O
train B-TER
I O
heard O
an O
excited O
crowd O
on O
the O
platform O
who O
probably O
assumed O
I O
had O
acted O
out O
of O
lovesickness O
and O
who O
were O
now O
grumbling O
that O
I O
fully O
deserved O
a O
good O
hiding B-TER
etc O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
out O
of O
my O
mind O
, O
felt O
no O
pain O
, O
just O
despair O
at O
still O
being O
alive O
and O
cried O
out O
, O
You O
should O
try O
being O
persecuted O
like O
a O
Jew O
sometime O
! O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
two O
rail O
workers B-TER
came O
along O
and O
pulled O
me O
out O
from O
between O
two O
coaches B-TER
, O
together O
with O
my O
bag O
which O
was O
unscathed O
. O

Behrend B-PER
was O
feeling O
rather O
uncomfortable O
and O
he O
said O
to O
me O
, O
But O
we O
are O
good O
people O
, O
we O
would O
have O
let O
you O
get O
away O
, O
whereupon O
I O
replied O
, O
still O
unaware O
of O
the O
injury B-TER
to O
my O
foot O
, O
Well O
, O
then O
let O
me O
get O
away O
! O
At O
this O
Behrend B-PER
just O
smirked O
at O
me O
and O
said O
, O
You O
certainly O
ca O
n’t O
do O
that O
now O
! O
I O
was O
carried O
to O
the O
waiting O
room O
on O
the O
platform O
, O
a O
young O
soldier B-TER
was O
nearby O
. O

I O
felt O
no O
pain O
, O
my O
ankle O
joint O
had O
been O
completely O
smashed O
, O
my O
foot O
was O
only O
a O
shapeless O
mass O
. O

My O
brain O
was O
feverishly O
trying O
to O
work O
out O
how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
bag O
, O
and O
with O
it O
the O
Dänes B-PER
' I-PER
address O
. O

Very O
quietly O
, O
I O
asked O
the O
soldier B-TER
to O
take O
the O
bag O
but O
he O
was O
not O
brave O
enough O
, O
as O
he O
knew O
that O
something O
was O
not O
right O
. O

Behrend B-PER
called O
an O
ambulance B-TER
from O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Hospital I-TER
in O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
which O
at O
this O
time O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
assembly O
camp O
instead O
of O
Grosse B-LOC
Hamburger I-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
into O
which O
I O
was O
carried O
on O
a O
stretcher O
. O

Behrend B-PER
sat O
next O
to O
the O
stretcher O
on O
the O
journey O
to O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
. O

I O
now O
got O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
cards B-TER
out O
of O
my O
bag O
and O
with O
Behrend B-PER
watching O
not O
daring O
to O
take O
them O
away O
from O
me O
, O
tore O
them O
up O
into O
the O
tiniest O
pieces O
I O
could O
, O
so O
that O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
put O
them O
together O
again O
and O
scattered O
the O
pieces O
in O
the O
ambulance B-TER
, O
as O
the O
window O
was O
shut O
so O
I O
could O
not O
throw O
them O
out O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
medical I-TER
staff I-TER
who O
were O
interned O
there O
and O
looked O
after O
the O
prisoners B-TER
were O
waiting O
at O
the O
entrance O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
. O

Not O
until O
then O
did O
I O
lose O
consciousness O
and O
only O
came O
to O
again O
during O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
doctors B-TER
had O
performed O
an O
operation B-TER
on O
my O
foot O
and O
put O
a O
two O
- O
part O
plaster O
cast O
from O
my O
knee O
to O
my O
upper O
thigh O
, O
as O
my O
foot O
had O
to O
be O
bandaged O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

It O
was O
thoroughly O
decaying O
. O

I O
had O
gangrene B-TER
and O
osteomyelitis B-TER
and O
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
, O
who O
was O
treating O
me O
along O
with O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Helischkowski B-PER
and O
Dr O
Cohen B-PER
, O
bathed O
the O
foot O
each O
day O
, O
removed O
loose B-TER
bone I-TER
splinters I-TER
and O
took O
the O
greatest O
possible O
pains O
to O
help O
me O
. O

I O
lay O
for O
4 O
months O
with O
a O
temperature B-TER
of O
40 O
° O
, O
lost O
40 O
lbs O
and O
only O
after O
the O
third O
blood B-TER
transfusion I-TER
did O
the O
fever B-TER
then O
slowly O
subside O
. O

Usually O
they O
would O
have O
amputated B-TER
my O
foot O
, O
however O
I O
would O
then O
usually O
have O
been O
deported B-TER
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
soon O
after O
the O
amputation B-TER
. O

Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
knew O
this O
, O
and O
as O
he O
had O
sympathy O
for O
me O
, O
he O
tried O
to O
save O
me O
and O
he O
managed O
to O
do O
it O
as O
well O
, O
by O
getting O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
Moeller B-PER
( O
this O
latter O
was O
the O
second O
highest O
authority O
after O
Heydrich B-PER
, O
so O
I O
was O
told O
) O
, O
interested O
in O
my O
case O
. O

Moeller B-PER
had O
studied O
medicine B-TER
for O
several O
semesters O
and O
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
turned O
me O
into O
a O
case O
study O
. O

My O
life O
was O
worthless O
in O
any O
case O
, O
so O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O
bad O
, O
if O
my O
foot O
had O
cost O
me O
my O
life O
. O

So O
to O
satisfy O
the O
interest O
of O
Herr B-TER
Moeller B-PER
I O
was O
and O
remained O
under O
arrest B-TER
behind O
barbed O
wire O
in O
Iranische B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
, O
confined O
to O
bed O
, O
my O
foot O
up O
in O
a O
sling O
for O
months O
, O
in O
the O
most O
terrible O
pain O
. O

At O
night O
the O
supervisory O
staff O
would O
come O
through O
the O
ward O
, O
shine O
a O
light O
into O
the O
beds O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
was O
still O
there O
, O
and O
people B-TER
were O
constantly O
being O
deported B-TER
, O
even O
on O
stretchers O
, O
so O
that O
I O
had O
screaming O
fits O
for O
fear B-TER
of O
also O
being O
transported B-TER
in O
this O
condition O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
was O
the O
only O
full O
Jew O
who O
stayed O
there O
under O
arrest B-TER
for O
such O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
terrible O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
and O
, O
after O
the O
first O
four O
months O
when O
I O
began O
slowly O
to O
start O
eating B-TER
again O
, O
terrible O
hunger B-TER
. O

Each O
morning O
two O
dry O
slices O
of O
bread B-TER
with O
jam B-TER
, O
each O
evening O
the O
same O
and O
at O
midday O
soup B-TER
made O
from O
water B-TER
used O
to O
boil O
swede B-TER
or O
kohlrabi B-TER
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
already O
sick O
just O
at O
the O
smell O
of O
it O
. O

During O
the O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
we O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
cellar O
. O

At O
times O
I O
got O
yet O
another O
high O
fever B-TER
, O
then O
the O
plaster O
splints O
would O
be O
scaled O
down O
and O
the O
Jewish B-TER
nurse I-TER
would O
lift O
me O
into O
a O
wicker O
chair O
in O
which O
I O
was O
hardly O
able O
to O
sit O
, O
I O
had O
lost O
so O
much O
weight O
and O
had O
become O
so O
weak O
. O

In O
the O
hospital B-TER
there O
were O
also O
so O
- O
called O
free O
patients O
, O
that O
is O
, O
those O
of O
mixed B-TER
race I-TER
, O
who O
were O
still O
protected O
by O
that O
part O
of O
their O
parentage O
that O
was O
Christian B-TER
. O

where O
they O
lived O
. O

In O
this O
way O
April O
1945 O
arrived O
. O

The O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
came O
so O
frequently O
, O
that O
with O
several O
other O
patients O
I O
had O
to O
spend O
weeks O
in O
the O
dark O
hospital B-TER
cellar O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
. O

It O
was O
impossible O
to O
move O
in O
the O
wheelchair O
and O
everything O
had O
to O
be O
done O
in O
it O
, O
in O
the O
dark O
without O
help O
from O
the O
nurse B-TER
. O

When O
the O
bombing B-TER
and O
the O
fighting B-TER
began O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
I O
contracted O
erysipelas B-TER
and O
my O
temperature B-TER
went O
up O
to O
40 O
° O
, O
but O
at O
least O
they O
managed O
to O
set O
up O
a O
bed O
for O
me O
in O
the O
cellar O
, O
in O
which O
I O
lay O
until O
liberation B-TER
on O
8th O
May O
1945 O
. O

I O
was O
a O
skeleton O
, O
weighed O
62 O
lbs O
, O
or O
31 O
kilos O
. O

One O
day O
during O
the O
bombing B-TER
it O
was O
so O
bad O
that O
everyone O
in O
the O
part O
of O
the O
cellar O
where O
I O
was O
lying O
ran O
away O
into O
another O
part O
of O
the O
cellar O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
there O
all O
alone O
, O
confined O
to O
bed O
, O
unable O
to O
move O
. O

Luckily O
nothing O
happened O
to O
me O
there O
, O
but O
the O
feeling O
of O
helplessness O
is O
indescribable O
. O

Foreign B-TER
Jews O
, O
among O
others O
Russian B-LOC
Jews O
, O
had O
also O
been O
interned O
there O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
; O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
went O
with O
a O
certain O
Herr B-TER
Gordon B-PER
to O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Kommandant O
there O
and O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
him O
who O
we O
were O
and O
asked O
for O
protection O
and O
help B-TER
. O

The O
Russians B-LOC
said O
that O
anyone O
who O
knew O
how O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
lived O
in O
Russia B-LOC
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
believe O
that O
there O
was O
single O
Jew O
still O
alive O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

However O
Herr B-TER
Dr O
Lustig B-PER
convinced O
them O
of O
this O
, O
and O
we O
got O
shelter B-TER
and O
help B-TER
as O
well O
as O
food B-TER
. O

Only O
on O
30th O
June O
1945 O
was O
I O
able O
to O
leave O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
still O
today O
have O
to O
receive O
frequent O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
, O
as O
my O
foot O
started O
to O
knit O
together O
only O
very O
slowly O
and O
opens O
up O
now O
and O
then O
and O
sometimes O
discharges B-TER
bone I-TER
fragments I-TER
. O

My O
mental O
state O
has O
also O
suffered O
badly O
. O

Despite O
this O
, O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
, O
I O
passed O
my O
master O
craftsman O
’s O
diploma B-TER
as O
a O
dressmaker B-TER
and O
am O
now O
independent O
, O
and O
I O
work B-TER
as O
much O
as O
my O
strength O
allows O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
for O
me O
, O
with O
the O
use O
of O
elaborate O
orthopaedic O
shoes B-TER
, O
with O
some O
effort O
, O
despite O
having O
no O
heel O
, O
just O
walking O
on O
the O
bone O
, O
and O
with O
diminished O
mobility O
in O
my O
ankle O
joint O
, O
in O
some O
measure O
to O
walk O
by O
myself O
. O

I O
enclose O
a O
photocopy O
of O
the O
permit O
for O
my O
release B-TER
from O
custody B-TER
dated O
29th O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
probably O
thought O
that O
in O
this O
way O
, O
by O
releasing B-TER
us O
from O
custody B-TER
shortly O
before O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
marched O
in O
, O
they O
would O
buy O
their O
freedom O
or O
at O
least O
mitigate O
the O
just O
punishment O
that O
was O
waiting O
for O
them O
. O

( O
All O
detainees B-TER
received O
this O
permit O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
those O
who O
were O
in O
a O
position O
to O
leave O
the O
building O
of O
course O
did O
so O
; O
I O
myself O
was O
far O
too O
ill B-TER
and O
helpless O
to O
leave O
) O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
a O
close O
friend O
who O
my O
mother O
had O
known O
for O
30 O
years O
. O

This O
lady B-TER
, O
a O
Christian B-TER
, O
had O
known O
me O
from O
the O
day O
I O
was O
born O
, O
she O
had O
met O
my O
mother O
many O
years O
before O
. O

As O
my O
parents O
trusted O
her O
completely O
, O
they O
gave O
her O
various O
items O
for O
safekeeping O
, O
among O
other O
things O
money B-TER
, O
and O
as O
we O
had O
had O
to O
surrender O
our O
gold O
and O
silver O
, O
a O
gold O
ring O
that O
she O
had O
once O
given O
to O
me O
. O

As O
she O
had O
been O
bombed B-TER
out I-TER
herself O
, O
everything O
but O
the O
money B-TER
and O
the O
ring O
had O
been O
lost O
. O

I O
visited O
her O
several O
times O
while O
I O
was O
living O
illegally B-TER
and O
did O
some O
sewing O
for O
her O
. O

After O
I O
was O
with O
the O
Dänes B-PER
and O
she O
had O
already O
been O
bombed B-TER
out I-TER
I O
asked O
her O
to O
give O
the O
ring O
back O
to O
me O
, O
as O
she O
, O
living O
in O
the O
city O
, O
was O
at O
much O
greater O
risk O
of O
air B-TER
raids I-TER
than O
the O
Däne B-PER
family B-TER
, O
consequently O
everything O
would O
have O
been O
much O
safer O
in O
Conradshöhe B-LOC
. O

Her O
reply O
was O
, O
I O
’ve O
already O
given O
the O
ring O
to O
somebody O
else O
some O
time O
ago O
! O
I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
had O
been O
slapped O
on O
the O
face O
; O
by O
this O
she O
had O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
in O
her O
judgement O
I O
would O
not O
survive B-TER
, O
so O
would O
never O
wear O
the O
ring O
again O
. O

Even O
the O
money B-TER
I O
could O
only O
get O
from O
her O
with O
difficulty O
in O
instalments O
. O

She O
never O
asked O
what O
I O
was O
living O
off O
at O
that O
time O
. O

She O
should O
have O
offered O
me O
my O
parents O
’ O
money B-TER
herself O
, O
especially O
as O
she O
knew O
the O
plight O
I O
was O
in O
, O
without O
a O
penny O
piece O
from O
home B-TER
, O
with O
only O
the O
compassion O
and O
mercy O
of O
strangers O
to O
rely O
on O
. O
