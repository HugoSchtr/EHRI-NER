London B-LOC
Experiences O
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
and O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
there O
and O
during O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
. O

Being O
saved B-TER
by O
a O
German B-LOC
Civil B-TER
Servant I-TER
and O
a O
Ukranian B-LOC
convent B-TER
. O

Before O
the O
war B-TER
, O
I O
lived O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
two O
children B-TER
in O
Krakow B-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC
. O

My O
husband O
was O
a O
Bank B-TER
Manager O
and O
I O
, O
myself O
, O
studied B-TER
to O
be O
a O
tailor O
in O
my O
youth O
and O
had O
a O
fashion O
salon O
, O
which O
went O
very O
well O
. O

In O
my O
youth O
, O
I O
insisted O
on O
learning B-TER
a O
trade B-TER
and O
studied B-TER
to O
be O
a O
tailor O
. O

I O
was O
actually O
a O
fervent O
Zionist B-TER
and O
wanted O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Israel B-LOC
. O

In O
order O
to O
do O
this O
, O
I O
needed O
a O
practical O
trade B-TER
. O

My O
parents O
, O
however O
, O
were O
very O
much O
against O
it O
. O

They O
were O
not O
Zionists B-TER
. O

They O
were O
also O
not O
overly O
pious O
Jews O
, O
but O
were O
what O
I O
would O
describe O
as O
good O
Jews O
. O

I O
, O
thus O
, O
visited O
a O
technical B-TER
college I-TER
and O
learned O
everything O
about O
tailoring O
and O
I O
was O
also O
a O
teacher O
for O
a O
few O
years O
at O
the O
same O
college B-TER
- O
This O
latter O
profession O
would O
prove O
very O
beneficial O
to O
me O
during O
the O
occupation B-TER
. O

A O
day O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war B-TER
, O
we O
left O
Krakow B-LOC
to O
resettle O
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
, O
where O
my O
parents O
lived O
. O

I O
remained O
there O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

During O
the O
first O
two O
years O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
Lemberg B-LOC
formed O
part O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
zone O
of O
occupation B-TER
… O
that O
means O
: O
occupied B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

Nothing O
happened O
to O
us O
during O
this O
time O
and O
I O
may O
say O
explicitly O
that O
the O
Russians B-LOC
behaviour O
was O
beyond O
reproach O
. O

We O
could O
pursue O
our O
trades B-TER
. O

My O
husband O
worked B-TER
once O
a O
week O
at O
a O
bank B-TER
and O
I O
as O
a O
Tailor O
. O

Our O
children B-TER
, O
a O
daughter B-TER
of O
nine O
years O
and O
a O
son B-TER
of O
five O
attended O
school B-TER
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
even O
though O
a O
war B-TER
was O
on O
, O
that O
we O
were O
occupied B-TER
by O
a O
foreign B-TER
army I-TER
and O
that O
we O
considered O
the O
Russians B-LOC
invaders O
and O
did O
not O
love O
our O
enemy O
… O
, O
nothing O
disturbed O
our O
existence O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
many O
Polish B-LOC
Jews O
were O
kidnapped B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

These O
were O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
decided O
to O
cross O
the O
border O
into O
the O
German B-LOC
zone O
or O
had O
attempted O
to O
do O
so O
illegally B-TER
. O

They O
were O
classified O
as O
unreliable O
and O
transported B-TER
to O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

As O
we O
were O
not O
of O
such O
a O
mind O
to O
emigrate B-TER
from O
the O
Russian B-LOC
occupied B-TER
zone O
into O
the O
German B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
left O
alone O
. O

We O
were O
given O
Russian B-LOC
passports B-TER
and O
nothing O
more O
. O

When O
I O
now O
think O
about O
it O
, O
what O
we O
later O
experienced O
and O
suffered O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
it O
was O
not O
clear O
to O
us O
at O
the O
time O
that O
relatively O
the O
Russians B-LOC
behaved O
like O
angels O
. O

In O
June O
1941 O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
came O
and O
the O
persecution B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
began O
immediately O
. O

This O
would O
not O
have O
been O
possible O
had O
the O
Ukranian B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
populations O
not O
gone O
along O
with O
it O
. O

Had O
they O
not O
done O
this O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
would O
first O
of O
all O
have O
been O
forced O
to O
find O
out O
who O
was O
a O
Jew O
and O
where O
they O
lived O
. O

The O
Ukranians B-LOC
and O
Poles B-LOC
knew O
this O
and O
immediately O
informed O
the O
German B-LOC
occupiers B-TER
, O
so O
that O
no O
- O
one O
needed O
to O
wait O
for O
murder B-TER
and O
persecution B-TER
. O

Immediately O
after O
the O
invasion B-TER
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
ordered O
into O
so O
- O
called O
labour B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
where O
the O
distribution O
of O
so O
- O
called O
work O
began O
. O

To O
this O
, O
belonged O
, O
for O
example O
, O
cleaning O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
for O
women B-TER
. O

Mothers B-TER
’ O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
take O
their O
daughters B-TER
to O
this O
work B-TER
, O
and O
fathers B-TER
’ O
, O
their O
sons B-TER
. O

My O
husband O
registered B-TER
himself O
as O
a O
carpenter O
as O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
it O
was O
assumed O
amongst O
the O
Jews O
, O
that O
Jews O
with O
practical O
trades B-TER
would O
not O
be O
deported B-TER
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
took O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
my O
husband O
our O
small O
son O
to O
work B-TER
. O

The O
work B-TER
never O
went O
by O
without O
beatings B-TER
and I-TER
brutality I-TER
. O

We O
received O
no O
pay B-TER
and O
nothing O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

In O
order O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
alive O
, O
we O
furtively O
sold O
jewellery O
and O
other O
items O
belonging O
to O
our O
parents O
. O

This O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
strictly O
forbidden O
, O
but O
gentile O
Poles B-LOC
risked O
punishment B-TER
, O
because O
they O
could O
buy O
the O
most O
beautiful O
objects O
for O
a O
song O
in O
this O
way O
. O

With O
this O
money B-TER
, O
we O
bought O
black B-TER
market I-TER
food B-TER
. O

Even O
this O
was O
, O
naturally O
, O
forbidden O
. O

In O
spring O
1942 O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
resettlements B-TER
began O
and O
nobody O
knew O
that O
it O
concerned O
evacuation B-TER
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
of O
Belzec B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
15 O
- O
20,000 O
Jews O
with O
children B-TER
went O
there O
. O

Even O
I O
was O
trapped O
with O
my O
husband O
and O
children B-TER
in O
the O
school B-TER
which O
served O
as O
a O
detention B-TER
centre O
and O
we O
waited O
for O
deportation B-TER
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
a O
coincidence O
that O
was O
never O
really O
explained O
, O
we O
were O
brought O
out O
of O
the O
school B-TER
by O
the O
Council O
of O
Jewish O
Elders O
and O
sent O
back O
to O
our O
already O
cordoned O
- O
off O
apartment B-TER
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

We O
had O
spent O
a O
day O
and O
a O
night O
in O
the O
detention B-TER
centre O
. O

Our O
parents O
, O
who O
lived O
in O
another O
part O
of O
Lemberg B-LOC
were O
, O
at O
this O
time O
, O
left O
alone O
. O

We O
decided O
from O
now O
on O
not O
to O
let O
our O
children B-TER
onto O
the O
streets O
alone O
. O

In O
August O
1942 O
, O
the O
first O
large O
- O
scale O
operation O
took O
place O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
SS B-ORG
put O
a O
special O
stamp O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
permit I-TER
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
, O
those O
who O
had O
a O
stamp O
on O
their O
card B-TER
, O
would O
not O
be O
resettled O
. O

My O
husband O
had O
such O
a O
stamp O
and O
felt O
very O
secure O
because O
of O
it O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
such O
a O
stamp O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
take O
the O
children B-TER
and O
I O
would O
seek O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
the O
killings B-TER
and O
people B-TER
spoke O
constantly O
of O
resettlement O
. O

Continuously O
during O
the O
day O
and O
particularly O
at O
night O
, O
trains B-TER
departed O
with O
Jews O
… O
, O
since O
that O
time O
, O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
the O
sound O
of O
trains B-TER
. O

We O
then O
later O
found O
out O
that O
some O
of O
the O
transports B-TER
went O
directly O
to O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

Only O
the O
younger O
people O
were O
initially O
deported B-TER
to O
the O
various O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
slowly O
killed B-TER
. O

We O
looked O
for O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
for O
me O
and O
found O
one O
in O
the O
house B-TER
next O
door O
. O

There O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
had O
a O
hat O
shop O
, O
which O
had O
, O
naturally O
, O
long O
since O
stopped O
trading B-TER
and O
within O
this O
closed O
shop O
the O
owner O
lived O
with O
her O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
niece O
. O

I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
this O
shop O
. O

We O
could O
not O
think O
of O
a O
better O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

The O
owner O
did O
not O
want O
me O
to O
bring O
my O
children B-TER
with O
me O
and O
, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
anything O
would O
happen O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
children B-TER
, O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
I O
would O
move O
into O
the O
shop O
and O
that O
, O
each O
morning O
before O
going O
to O
work B-TER
, O
my O
husband O
would O
give O
my O
food B-TER
to O
my O
daughter B-TER
in O
the O
shop O
on O
my O
behalf O
. O

He O
would O
then O
collect O
her O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
at O
the O
keyhole O
of O
the O
locked O
shop O
door O
and O
observed O
what O
went O
on O
in O
the O
street O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
my O
husband O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
morning O
with O
our O
son B-TER
, O
and O
saw O
them O
return O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
also O
saw O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
leading O
away O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

On O
the O
afternoon O
of O
the O
5th O
of O
August O
, O
it O
was O
the O
fifth O
day O
of O
the O
operation O
, O
one O
of O
the O
womens B-TER
’ O
brothers O
came O
, O
who O
had O
hidden B-TER
me O
and O
said O
It O
’s O
terrible O
today O
! O
Today O
, O
they O
’re O
taking O
the O
children O
! O
I O
got O
a O
terrible O
shock O
and O
begged O
her O
brother O
to O
get O
a O
message O
to O
my O
husband O
from O
me O
that O
he O
should O
hide B-TER
our O
children B-TER
, O
but O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
! O
From O
the O
keyhole O
, O
I O
could O
only O
see O
what O
happened O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house B-TER
. O

And O
, O
upon O
hearing O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
seeing O
them O
pass O
by O
, O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
they O
had O
gone O
into O
the O
house B-TER
next O
- O
door O
. O

We O
could O
hear O
how O
a O
member O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
asked O
the O
Landlady O
for O
the O
key O
to O
the O
shop O
. O

The O
landlady O
did O
not O
have O
the O
key O
, O
but O
a O
neighbour O
said O
that O
she O
had O
one O
and O
went O
to O
get O
it O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
put O
it O
into O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
leading O
to O
our O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
, O
but O
the O
lock O
did O
not O
work B-TER
properly O
. O

We O
all O
stood O
paralysed O
with O
fear B-TER
. O

He O
shook O
the O
door O
and O
pulled O
the O
bell O
cord O
up O
and O
down O
, O
but O
the O
door O
did O
not O
open O
. O

One O
kick O
with O
his O
boot B-TER
would O
have O
sufficed O
to O
kick O
it O
in O
, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
turned O
around O
and O
left O
without O
having O
opened O
the O
door O
. O

We O
were O
all O
still O
as O
if O
possessed O
. O

I O
heard O
a O
little B-TER
girl I-TER
say O
loudly O
to O
the O
Landlady O
outside O
the O
house B-TER
next O
- O
door O
They O
took O
Herr O
Stern O
and O
little O
Uri O
from O
our O
house O
! O
And O
, O
as O
the O
landlady O
was O
hard O
of O
hearing O
, O
she O
repeated O
the O
sentence O
once O
more O
even O
louder O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
learnt O
that O
they O
had O
taken O
my O
husband O
and O
child B-TER
. O

I O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
again O
. O

When O
it O
was O
dark O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
onto O
the O
street O
to O
look O
for O
them O
. O

The O
Jewish O
shopkeeper O
was O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
sister O
- O
in O
- O
law O
and O
niece O
fainted O
after O
the O
affair O
with O
the O
SS B-ORG
man B-TER
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
are O
now O
all O
dead B-TER
. O

I O
spent O
14 O
days O
wandering O
the O
streets O
at O
the O
time O
and O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
anything O
I O
could O
, O
but O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
. O

My O
parents O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

They O
were O
, O
along O
with O
120 O
others O
, O
in O
hiding B-TER
in O
an O
attic O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
had O
killed B-TER
40,000 O
Jews O
. O

Later O
, O
a O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
opened O
. O

All O
Jews O
had O
to O
go O
there O
voluntarily O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
small O
and O
cramped O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

We O
lived O
8 O
people B-TER
to O
a O
formerly O
very O
small O
commercial B-TER
premises I-TER
. O

I O
had O
my O
parents O
with O
me O
there O
, O
who O
only O
there O
learned O
of O
the O
disappearance O
of O
my O
husband O
and O
son B-TER
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
live O
inside O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
work B-TER
outside O
it O
. O

About O
six O
weeks O
after O
the O
operation O
I O
found O
work B-TER
as O
a O
tailor O
for O
two O
secretaries O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
. O

The O
first O
secretary O
was O
called O
Irmgard B-PER
Wieth I-PER
. O

She O
was O
about O
30 O
years O
old O
and O
came O
from O
Strasbourg B-LOC
where O
her O
father O
was O
a O
teacher B-TER
at O
the O
grammar B-TER
school I-TER
. O

She O
was O
very O
enthusiastic O
to O
have O
found O
a O
good O
tailor O
and O
spoke O
to O
me O
often O
. O

She O
also O
enquired O
as O
to O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
my O
husband O
and O
child B-TER
, O
whereupon O
she O
said O
Why O
did O
you O
not O
hide O
the O
child O
? O
At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
said O
to O
myself O
that O
she O
had O
to O
be O
a O
kind O
- O
hearted O
person O
, O
who O
sympathised O
and O
thought O
that O
I O
would O
possibly O
turn O
to O
her O
in O
an O
emergency O
. O

Like O
all O
German B-LOC
civil B-TER
servants I-TER
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
very O
good O
at O
general O
management O
. O

She O
lived O
in O
a O
very O
nice O
one B-TER
- I-TER
bedroom I-TER
apartment I-TER
with O
a O
kitchen B-TER
and O
bath B-TER
. O

She O
was O
supplied O
with O
considerable O
quantities O
of O
food B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
in O
particular O
. O

These O
were O
clothes B-TER
which O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
Jews O
. O

It O
was O
these O
clothes B-TER
which O
I O
had O
to O
alter O
for O
her O
. O

In O
November O
1942 O
, O
a O
second O
operation O
began O
. O

In O
the O
very O
first O
night O
, O
I O
coincidentally O
did O
not O
find O
myself O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
but O
my O
parents O
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
were O
there O
. O

I O
had O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
working B-TER
at O
a O
Polish B-LOC
lady B-TER
’s I-TER
. O

It O
was O
late O
and O
I O
said O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

She O
said O
that O
I O
had O
better O
stay O
the O
night O
there O
. O

Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
on O
the O
streets O
at O
night O
, O
so O
I O
stayed O
. O

Very O
early O
, O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
, O
my O
daughter B-TER
came O
. O

She O
had O
run B-TER
away I-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
took O
my O
daughter B-TER
to O
work B-TER
with O
me O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
. O

During O
the O
night O
and O
the O
following O
day O
, O
many O
Jews O
were O
arrested B-TER
, O
who O
were O
not O
employed B-TER
in O
the O
Wehrmacht O
and O
, O
as O
I O
turned O
up O
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
I O
was O
told O
We O
are O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
employ O
you O
! O
Most O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
did O
not O
go O
, O
only O
a O
very O
few O
, O
who O
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
like O
me O
, O
went O
to O
work B-TER
at O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
that O
morning O
. O

I O
was O
totally O
helpless O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
clear O
to O
me O
, O
if O
I O
returned O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
now O
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
, O
we O
would O
be O
killed B-TER
. O

And O
, O
as O
I O
saw O
no O
other O
way O
out O
, O
I O
crept O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
asked O
her O
if O
I O
could O
not O
, O
at O
least O
, O
give O
her O
my O
daughter B-TER
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Her O
first O
reaction O
was O
great O
surprise O
. O

How O
can O
I O
do O
that O
? O
She O
asked O
me O
. O

I O
know O
that O
you O
are O
alone O
in O
your O
apartment O
! O
I O
said O
that O
I O
knew O
why O
she O
hesitated O
; O
she O
was O
uncertain O
, O
as O
only O
Germans B-LOC
lived O
in O
the O
block O
. O

Finally O
, O
she O
explained O
that O
she O
would O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
day O
, O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
corridor O
of O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
waited O
. O

Some O
Jews O
were O
needed O
for O
black B-TER
market I-TER
work B-TER
. O

Now O
and O
again O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
appeared O
in O
order O
to O
see O
if O
I O
was O
still O
there O
. O

The O
other O
Jews O
, O
who O
were O
sitting O
there O
, O
asked O
me O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
do O
. O

I O
was O
scared O
to O
say O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

I O
could O
not O
say O
anything O
to O
them O
. O

Somehow O
, O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
would O
help O
me O
in O
the O
end O
, O
but O
nobody O
should O
know O
this O
. O

Around O
about O
evening O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
appeared O
again O
in O
the O
corridor O
and O
collected O
me O
. O

I O
must O
speak O
with O
my O
colleague O
she O
said O
. O

Please O
wait O
! O
The O
colleague O
, O
the O
second O
secretary O
, O
with O
whom O
she O
was O
close O
friends O
, O
and O
for O
whom O
I O
had O
also O
altered O
clothes B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
a O
male O
supervisor O
. O

After O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
, O
she O
appeared O
once O
more O
and O
said O
to O
me O
It O
’s O
OK O
! O
Take O
your O
armband B-TER
off O
( O
with O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
) O
and O
throw O
it O
away O
. O

Then O
, O
walk O
slowly O
and O
calmly O
along O
the O
street O
towards O
the O
tram O
stop O
. O

My O
friend O
and O
the O
Town O
Councillor O
will O
go O
before O
you O
and O
I O
will O
follow O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
manner O
that O
we O
walked O
through O
the O
whole O
town O
and O
were O
brought O
into O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

She O
only O
had O
potatoes B-TER
to O
eat B-TER
in O
her O
apartment B-TER
, O
as O
she O
almost O
always O
ate B-TER
in O
the O
canteen B-TER
at O
work B-TER
. O

This O
was O
all O
the O
same O
to O
us O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
with O
the O
potatoes B-TER
. O

I O
stayed O
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
for O
two O
weeks O
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
. O

I O
made O
enquiries O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
operation O
was O
over O
yet O
. O

I O
was O
very O
fearful B-TER
for O
my O
parents O
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
they O
were O
still O
alive O
. O

It O
was O
only O
after O
two O
weeks O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
let O
me O
go O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
find O
my O
parents O
. O

They O
were O
both O
alive O
, O
but O
they O
both O
believed O
that O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
were O
no O
longer O
alive O
. O

I O
returned O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
’s I-PER
apartment B-TER
and O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
I O
absolutely O
had O
to O
return O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

I O
could O
not O
leave O
my O
parents O
alone O
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
new O
armbands B-TER
had O
been O
distributed O
to O
the O
Jews O
, O
with O
the O
insignia O
of O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
knew O
a O
Jewish B-TER
Doctor I-TER
and O
she O
asked O
where O
she O
could O
get O
an O
armband B-TER
for O
me O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
Doctor I-TER
was O
very O
surprised O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
kept O
a O
Jew O
in O
hiding B-TER
and O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
take O
a O
relative O
of O
his O
. O

He O
offered O
her O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money B-TER
for O
this O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
came O
and O
told O
us O
that O
she O
was O
utterly O
disgusted O
. O

I O
’m O
not O
doing O
it O
for O
money O
! O
she O
explained O
. O

If O
I O
have O
you O
and O
your O
child O
at O
my O
home O
, O
I O
have O
a O
clear O
conscience O
… O
, O
but O
for O
money O
? O
No O
way O
! O
Again O
and O
again O
she O
protested O
when O
I O
told O
her O
I O
must O
return O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
to O
my O
parents O
. O

Alright O
! O
she O
said O
one O
day O
. O

Go O
, O
if O
you O
have O
to O
! O
But O
Lilith O
( O
that O
was O
my O
daughter O
) O
is O
staying O
with O
me O
! O
That O
’s O
a O
shame O
for O
the O
Gestapo O
. O

They O
’ll O
shoot O
you O
one O
day O
and O
then O
I O
’ll O
adopt O
Lilith O
! O
I O
then O
got O
my O
new O
armband B-TER
with O
her O
help O
, O
went O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
remained O
with O
her O
. O

Despite O
the O
armband B-TER
, O
my O
position O
was O
very O
complicated O
. O

Possession O
of O
an O
armband B-TER
ought O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
wearer O
had O
work B-TER
with O
the O
Wehrmacht O
, O
but O
I O
had O
no O
such O
work B-TER
. O

I O
had O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
acquire O
it O
illegally O
. O

This O
, O
I O
did O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
some O
work B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
Director O
of O
this O
factory B-TER
was O
very O
understanding O
towards O
Jews O
and O
was O
very O
good O
to O
them O
. O

I O
was O
even O
allowed O
to O
take O
my O
father O
into O
the O
factory B-TER
with O
me O
. O

Had O
I O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
this O
, O
he O
would O
have O
been O
killed B-TER
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
was O
63 O
years O
old O
; O
I O
said O
he O
was O
55 O
and O
therefore O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
work B-TER
with O
me O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

Every O
morning O
, O
we O
always O
left O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
with O
a O
group O
of O
35 O
Jews O
, O
in O
order O
to O
go O
to O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

The O
groups O
, O
who O
went O
to O
work B-TER
, O
were O
always O
led O
by O
a O
band B-TER
of O
musicians B-TER
composed O
of O
Jews O
, O
who O
had O
to O
play O
pleasing O
melodies B-TER
. O

It O
was O
always O
the O
same O
torment O
for O
me O
each O
morning O
and O
I O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
I O
was O
losing O
ever O
more O
nerves O
each O
morning O
. O

But O
, O
this O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Nazis O
. O

They O
were O
quite O
systematically O
driving O
us O
all O
mad O
! O
They O
wanted O
to O
ruin B-TER
our I-TER
nerves I-TER
. O

From O
the O
groups O
of O
those O
going O
to O
work B-TER
, O
there O
were O
, O
daily O
, O
hundreds O
brought O
out O
and O
murdered B-TER
. O

You O
never O
knew O
, O
when O
leaving O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
whether O
you O
would O
return O
alive O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
countless O
Jews O
disappeared O
into O
nothingness O
. O

In O
March O
1943 O
, O
they O
took O
my O
father O
from O
me O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
and O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
again O
. O

Every O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
I O
furtively O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
were O
working B-TER
during O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
darkness O
of O
the O
street O
, O
I O
discreetly O
took O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
crept O
away O
through O
the O
whole O
town O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

Then O
, O
during O
the O
following O
Sunday O
, O
I O
altered O
her O
clothes B-TER
, O
for O
it O
was O
only O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
could O
thank O
her O
for O
what O
she O
had O
done O
for O
my O
daughter B-TER
. O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
loved O
my O
needlework O
and O
, O
as O
her O
only O
interest O
was O
clothes B-TER
, O
the O
work B-TER
never O
came O
to O
an O
end O
. O

One O
of O
her O
rooms B-TER
was O
full O
of O
cupboards O
filled O
with O
clothes B-TER
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
spent O
Sundays O
’ O
with O
her O
and O
every O
Monday O
, O
at O
3.30am O
I O
crept O
from O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
, O
through O
the O
town O
and O
back O
into O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
I O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
unobserved O
returning O
from O
working B-TER
through O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
I O
turned O
around O
and O
went O
with O
another O
group O
who O
were O
going O
to O
work B-TER
through O
the O
day O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
outside O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
thing O
was O
, O
naturally O
, O
very O
dangerous O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
said O
to O
me O
again O
and O
again O
that O
I O
would O
definitely O
be O
caught O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
one O
day O
. O

The O
streets O
were O
full O
of O
Germans B-LOC
, O
Ukrainians B-LOC
and O
Poles B-LOC
, O
who O
might O
recognise O
me O
. O

Even O
if O
I O
was O
inconspicuous O
, O
anyone O
could O
see O
that O
I O
looked O
very O
rough O
and O
hungry B-TER
, O
as O
all O
Jews O
looked O
in O
comparison O
to O
other O
people B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
spent O
every O
weekend O
from O
December O
1942 O
until O
the O
end O
of O
May O
1943 O
without O
anything O
ever O
happening O
to O
me O
. O

On O
the O
31st O
of O
May O
, O
it O
was O
proclaimed O
The O
ghetto O
will O
be O
liquidated O
on O
the O
1st O
of O
June O
. O

All O
Jews O
within O
it O
must O
voluntarily O
report O
to O
the O
concentration O
camp O
The O
owner O
of O
our O
factory B-TER
tried O
once O
more O
to O
help O
all O
of O
the O
Jews O
who O
had O
worked B-TER
for O
him O
, O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
need O
to O
go O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

He O
negotiated B-TER
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
explained O
that O
our O
35 O
strong O
group O
of O
Jews O
could O
live O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

He O
promised O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
that O
he O
would O
have O
a O
particularly O
good O
leather B-TER
overcoat I-TER
illegally O
finished O
for O
each O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
agreed O
. O

However O
, O
after O
they O
had O
received O
their O
overcoats B-TER
, O
they O
insisted O
that O
the O
Jews O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
factory B-TER
for O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

As O
I O
left O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
in O
order O
to O
resettle B-TER
in O
the O
factory B-TER
, O
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
my O
mother O
with O
me O
. O

She O
had O
had O
typhus B-TER
and O
pneumonia B-TER
and O
was O
very O
weak O
, O
but O
had O
survived B-TER
both O
. O

I O
, O
thus O
, O
smuggled B-TER
her O
out O
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
into O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

And O
now O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
go O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
the O
Director O
was O
ordered O
to O
hasten O
all O
of O
us O
into O
this O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
! O
I O
knew O
that O
if O
I O
hid B-TER
, O
I O
could O
probably O
save O
myself O
by O
getting O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
during O
the O
night O
, O
but O
this O
would O
mean O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
my O
mother O
to O
go O
into O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
alone O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
bring O
myself O
to O
do O
that O
. O

To O
take O
her O
with O
me O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
impossible O
. O

It O
was O
also O
too O
far O
and O
she O
was O
too O
weak O
. O

I O
spoke O
to O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
and O
begged O
him O
to O
help O
us O
in O
any O
way O
he O
could O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
Director O
’s O
office O
during O
this O
conversation O
and O
my O
mother O
was O
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms O
of O
the O
factory B-TER
. O

She O
must O
have O
felt O
what O
was O
going O
on O
inside O
me O
. O

I O
suddenly O
heard O
a O
large O
noise O
and O
disquiet O
in O
the O
square O
. O

Your O
mother O
has O
fallen O
out O
of O
the O
window O
! O
At O
first O
, O
I O
did O
not O
catch O
on O
at O
all O
and O
continued O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
Director O
, O
until O
someone O
came O
up O
to O
me O
again O
and O
called O
me O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
understood O
. O

I O
raced O
down O
the O
staircase O
into O
the O
square O
. O

I O
found O
my O
mother O
in O
a O
sea O
of O
blood B-TER
; O
one O
eye B-TER
was I-TER
missing I-TER
and O
the O
crown O
of O
her O
skull B-TER
was I-TER
broken I-TER
, O
but O
she O
was O
fully O
conscious O
. O

I O
called O
like O
mad O
for O
the O
medics B-TER
. O

I O
had O
totally O
forgotten O
in O
my O
excitement O
that O
Jews O
had O
no B-TER
right I-TER
to O
medical B-TER
assistance I-TER
. O

I O
phoned O
them O
and O
asked O
them O
to O
come O
immediately O
. O

As O
time O
passed O
and O
no O
- O
one O
arrived O
, O
I O
ran O
in O
order O
to O
ask O
why O
no O
- O
one O
was O
coming O
. O

I O
was O
then O
told O
that O
the O
medics B-TER
had O
turned O
up O
, O
but O
had O
left O
again O
upon O
being O
told O
the O
matter O
concerned O
a O
Jew O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Director O
had O
readied O
a O
car O
in O
which O
his O
group O
of O
Jews O
would O
be O
conveyed O
to O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

Upon O
my O
request O
, O
he O
had O
a O
stretcher O
brought O
upon O
which O
my O
mother O
was O
laid O
. O

The O
Director O
then O
ordered O
that O
we O
be O
brought O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
... O
, O
to O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
hospital B-TER
and O
be O
dropped O
off O
there O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
remaining O
passengers O
would O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

This O
event O
saved O
my O
life O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
to O
be O
burned B-TER
down I-TER
the O
following O
day O
and O
I O
knew O
that O
my O
mother O
, O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
had O
an O
even O
greater O
fear B-TER
of O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
hospital B-TER
, O
as O
it O
was O
very O
brutal O
there O
and O
that O
those O
patients O
to O
be O
treated O
, O
who O
could O
not O
be O
saved O
, O
were O
thrown B-TER
out I-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
window I-TER
. O

So O
, O
I O
sat O
in O
the O
car O
next O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
still O
fully O
conscious O
, O
and O
yet O
blood B-TER
nevertheless O
streamed O
incessantly O
from O
her O
wounds O
. O

I O
must O
take O
you O
to O
the O
ghettohospital O
! O
I O
said O
to O
her O
. O

Are O
you O
afraid O
? O
To O
which O
she O
replied O
I O
’m O
not O
afraid O
! O
I O
was O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
mother O
had O
attempted B-TER
to I-TER
kill I-TER
herself I-TER
, O
in O
order O
to O
free O
me O
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
free O
to O
go O
to O
my O
child B-TER
and O
try O
to O
save O
us O
both O
. O

Upon O
arriving O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
we O
carried O
my O
mother O
in O
and O
placed O
the O
stretcher O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

All O
those O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
were O
about O
to O
leave O
. O

They O
all O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
was O
crazy O
to O
have O
come O
back O
with O
my O
mother O
. O

Within O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
found O
a O
doctor B-TER
and O
no O
patients O
. O

They O
had O
murdered B-TER
them O
all O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

Some O
attempted O
to O
lift O
my O
mother O
out O
of O
the O
continually O
streaming O
blood B-TER
. O

I O
asked O
the O
Doctor B-TER
to O
help O
her O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
had O
no O
medication B-TER
or O
anything O
else O
. O

I O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
asked O
him O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Jews O
ran O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
, O
once O
again O
, O
looked O
in O
the O
room O
where O
my O
mother O
lay O
. O

She O
said O
Go O
with O
God O
! O
I O
am O
now O
with O
God O
! O
I O
shut O
the O
door O
and O
looked O
once O
again O
for O
the O
Doctor B-TER
. O

I O
still O
had O
200 O
Zloty B-TER
which O
I O
had O
hidden O
on O
my O
person O
. O

This O
, O
I O
gave O
to O
him O
. O

Here O
! O
Take O
this O
Doctor O
! O
and O
I O
asked O
him O
one O
last O
time O
to O
give O
my O
mother O
something O
... O
, O
something O
which O
worked O
quickly O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
promised O
! O
Whether O
he O
actually O
did O
it O
... O
, O
I O
’ll O
never O
know O
! O
Then O
, O
I O
ran O
down O
and O
out O
of O
the O
hospital B-TER
and O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
Jews O
leaving O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
for O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

I O
ran O
like O
an O
automaton O
beside O
them O
. O

I O
ran O
totally O
possessed O
and O
desparately O
. O

I O
did O
not O
think O
for O
a O
minute O
about O
taking O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
to O
try O
to O
get O
to O
my O
child B-TER
. O

Through O
pure O
coincidence O
, O
the O
whole O
time O
I O
ran O
next O
to O
a O
young O
relative O
of O
mine O
... O
, O
a O
cousin O
. O

She O
spoke O
incessantly O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
listen O
at O
all O
and O
ran O
on O
. O

But O
she O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
she O
said O
to O
me O
... O
, O
Go O
away O
! O
You O
must O
go O
to O
your O
child O
! O
Run O
! O
Quickly O
! O
Go O
! O
Again O
, O
I O
did O
not O
react O
and O
my O
cousin O
spoke O
on O
You O
must O
go O
! O
Quickly O
! O
Otherwise O
it O
’s O
too O
late O
! O
I O
can O
not O
explain O
it O
, O
how O
it O
suddenly O
happened O
and O
as O
I O
quite O
suddenly O
had O
the O
impulse O
to O
carefully O
take O
off O
my O
armband B-TER
and O
allow O
it O
to O
disappear O
into O
my O
pocket O
as O
we O
got O
quite O
close O
to O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Just O
as O
automatically O
, O
I O
slipped O
away O
from O
the O
group O
, O
which O
carried O
on O
. O

Poles B-LOC
and O
Ukrainians B-LOC
were O
standing O
at O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
looked O
on O
transfixed O
at O
how O
the O
Jews O
went O
voluntarily O
and O
without O
any O
supervision O
whatsoever O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
to O
their O
deaths B-TER
. O

I O
also O
do O
not O
know O
how O
I O
arrived O
totally O
unharmed O
into O
the O
block O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
earlier O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
taken O
a O
Jewish O
couple O
in O
and O
as O
I O
now O
arrived O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
remain O
, O
four O
people B-TER
were O
there O
, O
who O
she O
was O
hiding B-TER
. O

This O
was O
in O
June O
1943 O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
very O
complicated O
for O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
, O
as O
it O
was O
for O
us O
. O

It O
was O
horrifying O
for O
us O
to O
consider O
what O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
risking O
in O
order O
to O
save O
us O
. O

We O
also O
had O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
burden O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
at O
all O
with O
such O
matters O
, O
so O
I O
disguised O
myself O
as O
a O
country O
peasant O
, O
barefoot O
and O
crept O
out O
of O
the O
house B-TER
to O
get O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

It O
was O
only O
a O
little O
, O
as O
everything O
came O
from O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
, O
as O
we O
had O
no O
other O
food B-TER
. O

Only O
Germans B-LOC
lived O
in O
the O
block O
, O
who O
naturally O
, O
knew O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
worked B-TER
all O
day O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
that O
her O
apartment B-TER
was O
empty O
all O
day O
. O

We O
scarcely O
dare O
not O
appear O
. O

A O
period O
of O
time O
thus O
passed O
, O
during O
which O
we O
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
ever O
more O
nervous O
. O

Then O
, O
one O
day O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
suddenly O
received O
a O
telegram O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
from O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
hers O
, O
who O
informed O
her O
that O
he O
had O
two O
weeks O
leave O
and O
was O
coming O
to O
visit O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
totally O
beside O
herself O
and O
explained O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
make O
ourselves O
scarce O
. O

Good O
! O
I O
said O
. O

I O
saw O
her O
terrifying O
fear B-TER
and O
wanted O
, O
initially O
, O
to O
calm O
her O
. O

I O
will O
try O
to O
find O
somewhere O
for O
us O
! O
It O
was O
, O
however O
, O
totally O
impossible O
for O
me O
. O

The O
married O
Jewish O
couple O
, O
the O
husband O
of O
whom O
was O
a O
Pharmacist B-TER
, O
had O
zyankali B-TER
. O

He O
suggested O
that O
we O
share O
the O
poison O
, O
so O
that O
we O
could O
all O
poison O
ourselves O
. O

I O
told O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
that O
she O
should O
not O
worry O
, O
that O
we O
would O
leave O
her O
apartment B-TER
and O
find O
somewhere O
to O
commit O
suicide B-TER
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
protested O
vehemently O
. O

You O
do O
n’t O
know O
where O
to O
go O
! O
Even O
she O
was O
afraid O
. O

We O
gathered O
together O
and O
made O
a O
plan O
. O

The O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
next O
to O
the O
kitchen B-TER
was O
emptied O
and O
, O
from O
now O
on O
, O
we O
always O
locked O
ourselves O
in O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
visitors O
. O

Beforehand O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
, O
where O
nobody O
went O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
during O
the O
visit O
of O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
friend O
from O
Amsterdam B-TER
, O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
would O
be O
locked O
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

His O
wife O
would O
openly O
pose O
as O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
cook O
, O
who O
also O
lived O
with O
her O
and O
I O
would O
pose O
a O
her O
Tailor O
, O
who O
would O
work B-TER
for O
her O
during O
the O
day O
and O
go O
home O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
had O
to O
act O
as O
if O
I O
was O
leaving O
. O

These O
roles O
we O
then O
both O
played O
. O

The O
cook O
lived O
officially O
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
slept O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
her O
friend O
could O
not O
go O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Every O
evening O
I O
would O
loudly O
say O
Adieu O
! O
; O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
would O
accompany O
me O
to O
the O
door O
of O
her O
apartment B-TER
and O
whilst O
she O
opened O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
loudly O
and O
acted O
as O
though O
she O
was O
still O
talking O
to O
me O
, O
I O
crept O
back O
to O
the O
kitchen B-TER
on O
tiptoes O
. O

All O
four O
of O
us O
slept O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
on O
the O
floor O
, O
that O
is O
, O
in O
reality O
we O
did O
not O
sleep O
much O
. O

We O
constantly O
worried O
about O
one O
another O
, O
that O
one O
of O
us O
would O
make O
some O
kind O
of O
suspicious O
noise O
, O
talk O
whilst O
sleeping O
or O
even O
snore O
and O
so O
we O
all O
took O
care O
of O
each O
other O
. O

During O
the O
day O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
always O
went O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
and O
the O
friend O
stayed O
at O
the O
apartment B-TER
. O

He O
continually O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
to O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
and O
my O
daughter B-TER
sat O
on O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

I O
placed O
a O
large O
table O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
to O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
and O
spread O
my O
sewing O
out O
there O
. O

I O
did O
not O
speak O
much O
and O
when O
I O
did O
speak O
, O
I O
did O
so O
only O
a O
very O
little O
and O
in O
bad O
German B-LOC
. O

I O
always O
acted O
as O
though O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
her O
friend O
said O
. O

He O
talked O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
and O
gave O
us O
long O
lectures O
about O
the O
war B-TER
and O
the O
increasing O
English B-LOC
air B-TER
raids I-TER
. O

Sometimes O
, O
I O
left O
the O
kitchen B-TER
and O
acted O
as O
though O
I O
had O
something O
to O
do O
in O
one O
of O
the O
rooms B-TER
… O
, O
then O
I O
called O
him O
to O
help O
me O
with O
some O
hastily O
made O
- O
up O
chore O
, O
in O
order O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

As O
we O
all O
spoke O
to O
each O
other O
in O
whispers O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
acquainted O
with O
this O
when O
she O
was O
at O
home B-TER
. O

Her O
friend O
picked O
up O
upon O
this O
. O

He O
could O
not O
understand O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
ask O
her O
about O
it O
, O
or O
he O
would O
come O
out O
to O
me O
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
to O
ask O
me O
whether O
I O
could O
understand O
why O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
whispered O
so O
strangely O
and O
why O
she O
was O
so O
terribly O
nervous O
. O

I O
always O
said O
I O
could O
not O
understand O
and O
gave O
all O
sorts O
of O
reasons O
in O
my O
broken O
German B-LOC
. O

Two O
weeks O
finally O
came O
to O
an O
end O
and O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Amsterdam B-LOC
and O
we O
were O
all O
alone O
once O
more O
. O

A O
new O
problem O
surfaced O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
on O
holiday B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
to O
her O
mother O
’s O
. O

This O
time O
, O
she O
had O
to O
leave O
us O
all O
alone O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
. O

She O
had O
no O
other O
option O
but O
to O
lock O
us O
in O
for O
the O
whole O
time O
she O
was O
away O
. O

We O
could O
not O
even O
so O
much O
as O
move O
as O
the O
apartment B-TER
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
officially O
empty O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
was O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
sneeze O
; O
we O
were O
n’t O
able O
to O
pull O
the O
chain O
on O
the O
toilet O
… O
, O
but O
, O
this O
time O
, O
everything O
went O
well O
and O
when O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
returned O
from O
holiday B-TER
, O
all O
was O
well O
. O

Yet O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
became O
less O
calm O
and O
ever O
more O
nervous O
. O

We O
did O
what O
we O
could O
to O
calm O
her O
down O
, O
but O
there O
was O
really O
nothing O
we O
could O
do O
as O
we O
were O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
her O
disquiet O
. O

We O
became O
accustomed O
to O
reading O
her O
every O
wish O
from O
her O
eyes O
and O
we O
behaved O
like O
slaves O
to O
serve O
her O
and O
to O
be O
helpful O
to O
her O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
she O
had O
formed O
a O
relationship O
with O
a O
Wehrmacht O
officer B-TER
, O
who O
often O
visited O
her O
. O

He O
would O
always O
stay O
in O
the O
front O
room B-TER
and O
never O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
. O

For O
some O
inexplicable O
reason O
, O
her O
friend O
in O
Amsterdam B-LOC
learned O
of O
her O
friendship O
with O
the O
Wehrmacht O
officer B-TER
and O
he O
, O
thus O
, O
appeared O
one O
day O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
out O
of O
sheer O
jealousy O
without O
announcing O
his O
arrival O
beforehand O
. O

He O
kicked O
up O
such O
a O
fuss O
at O
the O
front O
door O
that O
we O
all O
reeled O
in O
shock O
, O
as O
we O
all O
believed O
it O
was O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

All O
four O
of O
us O
hastily O
disappeared O
into O
the O
kitchen B-TER
, O
which O
we O
locked O
behind O
us O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
went O
slowly O
to O
the O
door O
in O
order O
to O
give O
us O
time O
to O
disappear O
. O

The O
man B-TER
stormed O
in O
and O
began O
charging O
around O
like O
a O
wild O
animal O
, O
but O
not O
in O
search O
of O
us O
as O
we O
had O
thought O
, O
but O
after O
the O
supposed O
rival O
. O

He O
shook O
the O
kitchen B-TER
door O
and O
even O
looked O
through O
the O
keyhole O
in O
order O
to O
see O
whether O
his O
rival O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
hid O
himself O
there O
, O
but O
did O
not O
see O
us O
. O

He O
posed O
a O
terrible O
sight O
, O
but O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
finally O
succeeded O
in O
calming O
him O
down O
. O

He O
had O
, O
of O
course O
, O
found O
no O
- O
one O
, O
so O
he O
went O
away O
. O

This O
time O
, O
not O
only O
were O
we O
more O
dead O
than O
alive O
when O
we O
were O
alone O
once O
more O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
beside O
herself O
. O

It O
became O
ever O
more O
complicated O
for O
us O
to O
calm O
her O
down O
. O

Every O
time O
someone O
knocked O
on O
the O
door O
she O
believed O
it O
was O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
; O
she O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
open O
the O
door O
and O
it O
became O
ever O
more O
difficult O
to O
persuade O
her O
not O
to O
lose O
her O
head O
. O

Her O
friend O
from O
Amsterdam B-LOC
did O
not O
allow O
any O
peace O
. O

He O
got O
in O
contact O
with O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
friend O
in O
the O
Housing B-TER
Office I-TER
, O
the O
second O
Secretary O
, O
for O
whom O
I O
had O
sewn O
in O
the O
beginning O
and O
for O
whose O
part O
was O
asked O
for O
advice O
about O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
along O
with O
the O
Town O
Councillor O
, O
whether O
they O
should O
have O
taken O
on O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
and O
then O
, O
finally O
, O
whether O
they O
had O
helped O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
get O
into O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
. O

Both O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
colleague O
and O
her O
friend O
advised O
him O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
that O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
accommodated B-TER
my O
child B-TER
and O
I. O
He O
then O
turned O
up O
again O
one O
day O
totally O
surprisingly O
and O
barely O
after O
the O
door O
had O
opened O
, O
beginning O
to O
strike O
out O
and O
growled O
I O
know O
everything O
! O
You O
’ve O
been O
keeping O
a O
Jew O
and O
her O
child O
in O
here O
in O
hiding O
! O
You O
’ll O
leave O
your O
job O
in O
the O
general O
government O
in O
eight O
days O
otherwise O
I O
’ll O
report O
you O
! O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
began O
to O
cry O
and O
eventually O
convinced O
him O
to O
go O
with O
her O
into O
a O
room B-TER
and O
not O
remain O
in O
the O
corridor O
, O
where O
all O
the O
other O
occupants O
could O
hear O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
. O

The O
argument O
then O
continued O
for O
hours O
, O
whilst O
we O
crouched O
down O
with O
fear B-TER
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

He O
, O
then O
, O
eventually O
went O
away O
. O

From O
now O
on O
… O
, O
from O
March O
1944 O
, O
all O
four O
of O
us O
lived O
almost O
exclusively O
in O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
then O
received O
orders O
to O
leave O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-LOC
dissolved O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
general B-ORG
government I-ORG
before O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
approaching O
Russians B-LOC
and O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
to O
travel O
with O
the O
remaining O
civil B-TER
servants I-TER
back O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Now O
, O
for O
all O
four O
of O
us O
, O
it O
became O
essential O
to O
find O
a O
new O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

The O
Jewish O
couple O
, O
who O
were O
hidden B-TER
with O
us O
, O
had O
contacts O
in O
the O
Greek B-TER
- I-TER
Orthodox I-TER
community O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
convent B-TER
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
Szepticki B-PER
, O
who O
had O
already O
kept O
around O
60 O
Jews O
in O
hiding B-TER
with O
him O
or O
in O
other O
convents B-TER
. O

This O
involved O
the O
families B-TER
of O
Rabbis B-TER
’ O
in O
particular O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
knew O
these O
people B-TER
and O
his O
son B-TER
was O
in O
hiding B-TER
there O
. O

He O
and O
his O
wife O
now O
turned O
to O
Szepticki B-PER
asking O
for O
help O
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
insisted O
that O
she O
would O
tell O
the O
entire O
truth O
to O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
. O

She O
would O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
him O
that O
they O
were O
hidden B-TER
at O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
with O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
and O
that O
she O
would O
really O
ask O
him O
to O
take O
all O
four O
of O
us O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
she O
asked O
, O
later O
, O
she O
insisted O
. O

I O
knew O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
that O
this O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
. O

In O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
into O
a O
Ukrainian B-LOC
convent B-TER
you O
had O
to O
have O
very O
good O
contacts O
and O
references O
. O

The O
married O
couple O
had O
such O
with O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
and O
with O
other O
diverse O
convents B-TER
, O
who O
were O
subordinate O
to O
them O
. O

They O
not O
only O
had O
references O
, O
but O
also O
documents B-TER
. O

I O
, O
however O
, O
had O
neither O
one O
nor O
the O
other O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
, O
I O
told O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
that O
he O
should O
, O
in O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
do O
everything O
possible O
to O
save O
his O
wife O
and O
himself O
. O

I O
did O
not O
believe O
for O
a O
second O
that O
he O
would O
do O
the O
slightest O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
only O
at O
the O
very O
end O
that O
, O
should O
he O
be O
successful O
in O
finding O
shelter B-TER
for O
him O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
to O
put O
in O
a O
word O
for O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
. O

Despite O
his O
contacts O
at O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
the O
couple O
had O
the O
greatest O
difficult O
being O
accepted O
and O
their O
discussions O
went O
back O
and O
forth O
for O
weeks O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
would O
become O
of O
me O
and O
my O
child B-TER
and O
it O
was O
very O
bad O
, O
as O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
had O
, O
initially O
, O
to O
pack O
her O
things O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
just O
thought O
constantly O
how O
lucky O
it O
was O
that O
we O
had O
the O
zyankali B-TER
. O

Then O
, O
a O
miracle O
happened O
! O
The O
couple O
had O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
persuading O
the O
Metropolite B-TER
to O
take O
us O
in O
. O

And O
, O
exactly O
24 O
hours O
before O
they O
had O
to O
leave O
our O
house B-TER
, O
a O
nun B-TER
in O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
where O
the O
woman B-TER
was O
to O
be O
taken O
in O
, O
agreed O
to O
take O
in O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
me O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
she O
insisted O
that O
we O
would O
have O
to O
move O
into O
the O
convent B-TER
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
was O
difficult O
for O
me O
, O
as O
I O
had O
promised O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
I O
would O
remain O
with O
her O
until O
her O
departure O
and O
help O
her O
. O

There O
was O
, O
thus O
, O
no O
option O
for O
me O
other O
than O
to O
take O
my O
child B-TER
to O
the O
convent B-TER
for O
11 O
o’clock O
the O
next O
day O
. O

Once O
there O
, O
I O
explained O
to O
the O
nun B-TER
why O
I O
had O
to O
return O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
then O
returned O
to O
her O
apartment B-TER
. O

I O
helped O
her O
pack O
and O
took O
her O
to O
the O
train B-TER
; O
then O
I O
went O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
as O
well O
. O

I O
could O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not O
speak O
Ukrainian B-LOC
, O
yet O
they O
were O
very O
good O
to O
us O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
went O
into O
an O
orphanage B-TER
annexed O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

And O
, O
again O
, O
I O
was O
lucky O
that O
I O
could O
sew O
. O

I O
was O
immediately O
given O
a O
sewing O
machine O
and O
a O
pile O
of O
sewing O
. O

It O
was O
in O
this O
way O
that O
I O
sewed O
for O
the O
orphans B-TER
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

We O
were O
fed B-TER
well O
and O
amply O
and O
actually O
began O
to O
recover O
somewhat O
physically O
. O

A O
fairly O
long O
while O
passed O
until O
I O
began O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
nun B-TER
was O
becoming O
rather O
a O
little O
less O
frien O
dly O
with O
me O
than O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

Finally O
, O
one O
day O
, O
a O
Jewish O
woman B-TER
said O
to O
me O
, O
who O
was O
also O
hiding B-TER
in O
the O
convent B-TER
, O
rather O
as O
if O
in O
passing O
, O
the O
nun O
no O
longer O
wants O
you O
here O
, O
because O
you O
wo O
n’t O
be O
baptised O
! O
I O
was O
absolutely O
horrified O
, O
as O
I O
had O
not O
given O
it O
any O
thought O
at O
all O
. O

It O
was O
then O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
those O
supervising O
the O
convent B-TER
always O
expected O
such O
things O
without O
having O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
anything O
but O
that O
which O
could O
be O
described O
as O
a O
pious B-TER
Jew O
, O
I O
stuck O
to O
my O
beliefs O
and O
the O
thought O
of O
baptism B-TER
to O
me O
was O
horrifying O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
for O
many O
nights O
until O
I O
decided O
to O
have O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
myself O
baptised B-TER
. O

But O
, O
the O
nun B-TER
’s I-TER
stance O
became O
ever O
more O
unpleasant O
and O
so O
I O
went O
to O
her O
one O
day O
and O
explained O
that O
I O
would O
like O
to O
have O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I O
baptised B-TER
. O

The O
nun B-TER
immediately O
became O
filled O
with O
interest O
and O
changed O
her O
stance O
in O
an O
instant O
. O

A O
priest B-TER
was O
assigned O
the O
task O
of O
instructing O
my O
daughter B-TER
and O
I. O
My O
daughter B-TER
was O
immensely O
pleased O
. O

She O
found O
everything O
great O
and O
was O
completely O
happy O
and O
content O
. O

And O
, O
with O
that O
, O
I O
had O
no O
way O
out O
, O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
save O
my O
life O
and O
my O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
life O
. O

One O
night O
, O
I O
dreamt O
of O
my O
father O
. O

In O
my O
dream O
, O
I O
asked O
him O
what O
I O
should O
do O
. O

He O
replied O
very O
calmly O
Just O
do O
it O
! O
It O
is O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
! O
There O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
only O
one O
God O
! O
Afterwards O
, O
it O
was O
much O
easier O
for O
me O
. O

One O
day O
, O
news O
arrived O
from O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

She O
was O
back O
in O
Lemberg B-LOC
and O
wanted O
all O
four O
of O
us O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
. O

The O
nun B-TER
quite O
energetically O
denounced O
the O
idea O
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
, O
whom O
she O
did O
not O
like O
very O
much O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
leave O
, O
but O
neither O
my O
daughter B-TER
nor O
I O
could O
go O
. O

So O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

During O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
baptism B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
attend O
mass O
every O
Sunday O
and O
the O
church B-TER
was O
located O
in O
the O
district O
in O
which O
we O
had O
earlier O
lived O
when O
my O
husband O
and O
son B-TER
were O
still O
alive O
. O

I O
was O
always O
afraid O
when O
I O
was O
going O
to O
and O
from O
the O
church B-TER
that O
someone O
would O
recognise O
me O
. O

I O
was O
well O
dressed B-TER
again O
and O
looked O
well O
- O
kept O
and O
nourished B-TER
once O
more O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
recognise O
me O
again O
. O

Many O
people B-TER
, O
who O
previously O
knew O
me O
, O
went O
to O
this O
church B-TER
and O
followed O
me O
from O
the O
service O
to O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

I O
immediately O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
nun B-TER
and O
was O
immediately O
resettled O
into O
the O
orphanage B-TER
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
nun B-TER
explained O
to O
the O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
if O
she O
returned O
to O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
, O
as O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
keep O
her O
at O
the O
convent B-TER
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
else O
for O
the O
woman B-TER
to O
do O
but O
to O
go O
. O

I O
, O
however O
, O
was O
sent O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
to O
ask O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
for O
the O
key O
to O
her O
apartment B-TER
. O

The O
Pharmacist B-TER
’s I-TER
wife O
later O
remained O
in O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
's I-PER
apartment B-TER
and O
, O
after O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
ordered O
back O
to O
Germany B-LOC
, O
quite O
a O
few O
Germans B-LOC
vacated O
this O
block O
and O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

When O
the O
Russians B-LOC
came O
, O
they O
behaved O
exactly O
as O
they O
had O
in O
the O
beginning O
… O
, O
thoroughly O
correctly O
. O

No O
- O
one O
harassed O
us O
; O
we O
could O
come O
and O
go O
as O
we O
pleased O
. O

This O
time O
, O
we O
really O
had O
the O
feeling O
that O
they O
were O
angels O
who O
had O
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

At O
my O
baptism B-TER
, O
I O
was O
given O
the O
name O
Maria O
. O

Sometime O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war B-TER
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
send O
my O
daughter B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
through O
an O
international B-TER
aid I-TER
organisation I-TER
. O

I O
then O
gave O
her O
the O
task O
of O
immediately O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
contact O
with O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

I O
had O
the O
address O
of O
her O
parents O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
really O
wanted O
to O
know O
whether O
she O
was O
alive O
and O
how O
she O
was O
. O

My O
daughter B-TER
succeeded O
in O
contacting O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

She O
was O
alive O
, O
but O
was O
obviously O
not O
doing O
too O
well O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
England B-LOC
a O
year O
after O
my O
daughter B-TER
, O
I O
tried O
to O
acquire O
food B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
for O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
. O

This O
was O
made O
possible O
with O
the O
help O
of O
an O
American B-LOC
aid B-TER
organisation I-TER
, O
which O
declared O
itself O
in O
the O
case O
. O

We O
began O
to O
become O
interested O
in O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
and O
, O
initially O
, O
began O
one O
day O
to O
visit O
us O
in O
England B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
very O
exciting O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
she O
explained O
that O
she O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
remain O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
the O
same O
American B-LOC
aid B-TER
organisation I-TER
, O
I O
was O
actually O
able O
to O
make O
it O
possible O
, O
that O
she O
went O
to O
the O
USA B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
she O
found O
employment B-TER
and O
remained O
there O
. O

She O
no O
longer O
wishes O
to O
return O
to O
Germany B-LOC
. O

She O
works B-TER
for O
a O
Jewish O
family B-TER
, O
whose O
household B-TER
she O
manages O
. O

Her O
love O
for O
my O
daughter B-TER
has O
n’t O
changed O
. O

When O
my O
daughter B-TER
got O
married O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
resettled O
in O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
with O
her O
English B-LOC
husband O
, O
Frau O
Wieth B-PER
was O
ready O
to O
help O
both O
of O
them O
. O

I O
, O
myself O
, O
married O
my O
current O
husband O
one O
and O
a O
half O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
to O
remain O
in O
England B-LOC
. O

Frau O
Wieth B-PER
intends O
to O
acquire O
American B-LOC
nationality B-TER
and O
will O
very O
soon O
receive O
the O
corresponding O
documents O
. O
