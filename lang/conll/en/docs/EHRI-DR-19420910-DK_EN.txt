concerning O
Mrs. O
Martha O
Hagen O
. O

I O
understand O
, O
that O
in O
Danish B-LOC
circles O
, O
where O
the O
German B-LOC
attitude B-TER
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
, O
we O
can O
be O
somewhat O
disappointed O
with O
the O
weak O
results O
in O
these O
cases O
and O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
we O
are O
too O
reluctant O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
envoy O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
like O
to O
try O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
to O
redress O
our O
difficulties O
. O

The O
official O
German B-TER
attitude I-TER
towards O
the O
Jews B-TER
gradually O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
severe O
as O
the O
war B-TER
progresses O
. O

The O
Jews B-TER
are O
seen O
as O
the O
enemies O
of O
the O
People O
and O
they O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
, O
at O
best O
through O
isolation O
in O
ghettos B-TER
in O
the O
designated O
areas O
. O

This O
attitude O
applies O
to O
the O
Jews B-TER
as O
a O
race B-TER
without O
regard O
to O
citizenship B-TER
, O
and O
the O
goal O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
similar O
to O
the O
German O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
also O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
foreign B-TER
Jews I-TER
in O
Germany O
are O
spared O
some O
of O
the O
most O
rigorous O
provisions B-TER
, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
non O
- O
German O
Jews B-TER
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
must O
be O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
nationalsocialist I-TER
. O

Both O
German O
and O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
were O
generally O
allowed O
to O
travel B-TER
earlier O
- O
so O
they O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
- O
, O
but O
as O
the O
war O
progressed O
, O
another O
consideration O
became O
more O
and O
more O
applicable O
: O
The O
fear O
of O
information B-TER
about O
conditions O
in O
this O
country O
being O
spread O
across O
the B-TER
world I-TER
, O
which O
could O
damage O
Germany B-TER
's I-TER
position O
and O
bring O
substance O
to O
the O
anti- O
nationalsocialist B-TER
propaganda B-TER
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
preferable O
not O
to O
see O
too O
much O
traffic O
across O
the O
borders O
, O
by O
persons O
who O
are O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
reliable B-TER
politically I-TER
– O
apart O
from O
the O
difficulties O
of O
permits O
for O
entry O
and O
exit O
in O
general O
- O
and O
for O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
who O
are O
all O
considered O
100%-unreliable O
, O
we O
now O
see O
an O
almost O
completely O
shut O
down O
. O

While O
there O
are O
still O
exceptions O
made O
for O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
it O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
for O
German O
Jews B-TER
to O
travel O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
acquired O
foreign O
citizenship B-TER
by O
marriage B-TER
, O
especially O
when O
the O
marriage O
took O
place O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
Jewish O
law O
, O
which O
is O
the O
case O
both O
with O
the O
married O
couple O
Hagen O
and O
with O
marriage O
of O
Thomsen O
in O
Schøn O
’s O
letter O
of O
7 O
August O
to O
Ryder O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
Jewish B-TER
laws I-TER
, O
several O
female B-TER
German O
Jews B-TER
married O
foreigners O
. O

The O
German B-TER
authorities I-TER
regard O
all O
these O
marriages O
as O
concluded O
solely O
for O
trying O
to O
circumvent O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
motives O
behind O
the O
marriages O
are O
self O
- O
evident O
( O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
man O
from O
acting O
on O
the O
noblest O
and O
most O
humane O
motives B-TER
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
according O
to O
German B-TER
opinion O
, O
mixing O
Aryan B-TER
and O
Jewish B-TER
blood O
is O
a O
crime B-TER
, O
and O
that O
marriages B-TER
between O
Aryans B-TER
and O
Jews B-TER
are O
forbidden O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
believe O
that O
we O
are O
wise O
to O
leave O
these O
cases O
as O
hopeless O
and O
save O
the O
very O
poor O
‘ O
goodwill O
’ O
we O
have O
for O
cases O
about O
Danish B-LOC
Jews B-TER
with O
Connection O
to O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

Even O
for O
their O
part O
, O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
, O
since O
the O
German O
side O
expects O
that O
the O
government B-TER
of O
a O
neighbouring O
country O
shows O
an O
understanding B-TER
of O
the O
German O
attitude O
, O

Minister O
Mohr O
's O
Letter O
of O
28 O
April O
to O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
regarding O
Articles O
in O
the O
' O
Kamptegnet B-TER
' O
, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
illustrative O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
you O
suggest O
allowing O
the O
Consulate O
General O
to O
go O
to O
the O
police B-TER
has O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
great O
caution O
. O

In O
several O
cases O
, O
the O
police O
have O
rejected B-TER
such O
requests O
from O
the O
Consulate O
General O
and O
wanted O
the O
issue O
to O
go O
the O
diplomatic B-TER
way O
. O

We O
have O
also O
seen O
that O
the O
police O
authorities O
have O
said O
to O
the O
Consulate O
General O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
look O
after O
the O
person O
if O
she O
continued O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
applications O
. O

We O
hereby O
reach O
a O
point O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
has O
n’t O
had O
much O
attention B-TER
at O
home O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
persons O
seeking O
our O
and O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
` I-ORG
assistance O
have O
tried O
all O
possible O
ways O
. O

The O
result O
easily O
becomes O
an O
Irritation O
to O
the O
Authorities O
, O
which O
may O
cause O
fatal O
consequences O
for O
the O
persons O
concerned O
. O

There O
is O
a O
risk O
that O
the O
authorities O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
more O
nonsense O
, O
will O
send B-TER
those O
concerned O
to O
the O
General B-TER
Government I-TER
or O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
1 O
) O
that O
the O
relatively O
gentle O
treatment O
of O
foreign O
Jews B-TER
in O
part O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
sharper O
course O
and O
2 O
) O
that O
the O
question O
of O
precautionary O
measures B-TER
against O
Jews B-TER
in O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
relevant O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
of O
no O
use O
that O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
more O
famous O
than O
most O
necessary O
as O
a O
Jewish B-TER
sanctuary O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
allow O
you O
to O
recommend O
that O
you O
explain O
to O
Mr. O
Hagen O
, O
that O
by O
pushing O
more O
on O
applications O
for O
the O
wife O
's O
exit O
permit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
through O
us O
as O
directly O
to O
the O
German O
authorities O
, O
will O
risk O
doing O
her O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
. O
