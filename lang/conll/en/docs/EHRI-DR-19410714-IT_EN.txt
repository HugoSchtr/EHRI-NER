Anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC
The O
measure B-TER
s O
officially O
and O
publicly O
taken O
by O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
against O
the O
Semitic B-TER
element I-TER
with O
the O
law B-TER
of O
last O
October O
have O
recently O
seen O
a O
further O
step O
- O
up O
. O

Last O
June O
the O
Government B-ORG
here O
issued O
an O
order O
whereby O
Jews B-TER
may O
not O
leave O
their O
homes O
after O
9 O
pm O
and O
before O
6 O
am O
. O

A O
further O
decree O
of O
26th O
June O
forbids O
people O
of O
the O
Jewish O
race O
to O
own O
and O
use O
radios B-TER
and O
telephones O
. O

All O
such O
devices O
, O
several O
thousands O
, O
were O
handed O
in O
to O
the O
Postal O
Authority O
, O
ostensibly O
so O
that O
they O
could O
be O
checked O
to O
see O
if O
they O
worked O
as O
transmitters O
as O
well O
, O
but O
actually O
they O
were O
not O
returned O
. O

Lastly O
, O
today O
the O
law O
of O
which O
I O
enclose O
a O
translated O
copy O
has O
been O
published O
, O
whereby O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
levies O
on O
all O
property B-TER
, O
whether O
movable O
or O
real O
, O
owned O
by O
people O
of O
the O
Jewish O
race O
, O
exempting O
only O
property O
having O
a O
total O
net O
worth O
lower O
than O
200,000 O
leva O
, O
a O
20 O
% O
duty B-TER
on O
property O
worth O
up O
to O
3,000,000 O
leva O
and O
a O
25 O
% O
duty B-TER
on O
property O
worth O
over O
that O
amount O
. O

As O
stated O
in O
Art O
. O

3 O
of O
this O
law O
, O
the O
duty B-TER
has O
to O
be O
paid O
both O
by O
Jews B-TER
having O
Bulgarian B-LOC
citizenship B-TER
and O
by O
foreign B-TER
Jews B-TER
, O
whether O
settled O
or O
not O
in O
the O
Country O
, O
who O
own O
movable O
or O
real O
property O
in O
Bulgaria O
. O

A O
delegation O
of O
Israelite B-TER
fellow O
- O
citizens O
who O
live O
here O
came O
to O
the O
R. O
Legation O
to O
invoke O
protection O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
exempt O
from O
the O
said O
extraordinary O
contribution O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Italo B-TER
- I-TER
Bulgarian I-TER
Trade I-TER
and I-TER
Navigation I-TER
Treaty I-TER
of O
1934 O
, O
which O
is O
still O
in O
force O
and O
, O
as O
we O
know O
, O
contains O
settlement O
clauses O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
citizens B-TER
of O
one O
Country O
in O
the O
other O
, O
stipulates O
( O
Art O
. O

) O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
internal O
taxation B-TER
that O
they O
shall O
receive O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
nationals O
. O

It O
would O
seem O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
there O
can O
not O
be O
on O
our O
part O
any O
intervention O
grounded O
in O
law O
, O
aimed O
at O
obtaining O
for O
the O
Israelite B-TER
fellow O
- O
citizens O
residing O
here O
an O
exemption O
from O
the O
extraordinary O
contribution O
required O
by O
the O
said O
law O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
issue O
has O
a O
scope O
that O
goes O
beyond O
the O
economic O
aspect O
. O

I O
therefore O
beg O
the O
Ministry O
to O
let O
me O
know O
, O
in O
view O
of O
some O
action O
that O
may O
be O
undertaken O
, O
how O
we O
treat O
foreign B-TER
Israelites O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
contributions O
like O
the O
one O
decreed O
today O
by O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
, O
and O
to O
advise O
me O
, O
moreover O
, O
if O
Bulgarian B-TER
Israelites B-TER
have O
been O
affected O
or O
not O
by O
similar O
measures O
