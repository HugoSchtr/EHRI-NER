But O
, O
as O
earlier O
despatches O
have O
already O
suggested O
, O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
has O
definitely O
worsened O
since O
the O
inauguration O
of O
the O
present B-ORG
regime I-ORG
three O
months O
ago O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the O
green O
- O
shirted O
Iron O
Guard O
is O
in O
power O
, O
and O
the O
Iron O
Guard O
is O
notoriously O
and O
avowedly O
an O
essentially O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
organization I-TER
. O

In O
the O
second O
place O
, O
Rumania B-LOC
not O
only O
has O
come O
under O
the O
direct O
‘ O
influence O
’ O
of O
Nazi B-TER
Germany I-TER
but O
is O
now O
actually O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Axis B-TER
and O
an O
adherent O
to O
the O
Tripartite O
Pact O
. O

And O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
country O
requires O
scape O
- O
goats O
for O
all O
the O
evils O
and O
misfortunes O
of O
the O
day O
, O
and O
finds O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
along O
with O
former O
King B-PER
Carol I-PER
and O
the O
old O
politicians O
, O
serve O
admirably O
in O
this O
unhappy O
role O
. O

These O
considerations O
, O
plus O
an O
underlying O
sentiment O
of O
genuine O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitism I-TER
generally O
, O
provide O
sufficient O
reason O
and O
background O
for O
Jewish B-TER
fears B-TER
and O
sufferings O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
today O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
recent O
weeks O
the O
Jewish B-TER
plaint O
has O
not O
been O
one O
of O
lost O
positions O
, O
special O
taxes B-TER
or O
discriminatory B-TER
restrictions I-TER
– O
that O
is O
an O
old O
story O
. O

Rather O
it O
has O
been O
one O
of O
deaths B-TER
, O
torture B-TER
, O
beatings O
, O
abductions B-TER
, O
confiscation B-TER
, O
robbery B-TER
and O
violence B-TER
in O
all O
forms O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
exaggeration O
to O
say O
that O
here O
today O
one O
sees O
the O
Jews B-TER
with O
tears O
, O
hollow O
eyes O
and O
wringing O
hands O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
never O
go O
out O
; O
they O
keep O
to O
their O
homes O
for O
fear B-TER
of O
meeting O
violence B-TER
in O
the O
street O
. O

A O
few O
, O
who O
have O
reasons O
to O
fear B-TER
they O
may O
be O
sought O
out O
, O
creep O
from O
friend O
to O
friend O
or O
house O
to O
house O
afraid O
to O
go O
to O
their O
own O
homes O
to O
sleep O
. O

Those O
of O
means O
endeavor O
frantically O
to O
dispose O
of O
their O
property B-TER
, O
secure O
funds O
abroad O
and O
find O
a O
way O
to O
leave B-TER
the I-TER
country I-TER
