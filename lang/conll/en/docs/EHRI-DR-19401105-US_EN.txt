directed O
against O
the O

General B-ORG

( O

): O
In O
view O
of O
the O
heavy O
migration B-TER
of O
population B-TER
into O
the O
new O
Jewish B-TER
ghetto B-TER
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
the O
period O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
voluntary O
establishment O
there O
by O
Jewish B-TER
families B-TER
from O
other O
quarters O
of O
the O
city O
has O
been O
extended O
through O
November O
15 O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
have O
been O
enlarged O
to O
take O
in O
certain O
additional O
blocks O
and O
it O
is O
feared O
that O
this O
enlargement O
may O
mean O
the O
moving B-TER
into I-TER
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
Jews B-TER
not O
as O
yet O
resident O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
decided O
to O
force O
the O
transfer O
of O
Jewish B-TER
owned O
and O
operated O
industrial B-TER
plants I-TER
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
and O
the O
removal O
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
many O
such O
enterprises O
carried O
on O
therein O
by O
non B-TER
- I-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

There O
are O
taking O
place O
conversations O
between O
the O
owners O
of O
such O
plants O
as O
to O
whether O
an O
exchange O
of O
ownership O
can O
not O
be O
effected O
in O
a O
manner O
acceptable O
to O
both O
the O
Jews B-TER
and O
non B-TER
- I-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

The O
authorities O
express O
the O
hope O
that O
this O
extension O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
idea O
to O
include O
industrial B-TER
enterprises I-TER
may O
be O
carried O
out O
without O
undue O
delay O

A O

Slovakian B-ORG

which O
will O
block O
Jewish B-TER

in I-TER

and O
will O
make O
obligatory O

of O
all O

Payments O
to O

from O

The O
above O
developments O
indicate O
that O
German B-TER
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
measures I-TER
are O
rapidly O
being O
put O
into O
effect O
in O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER

At O
the O

time O
the O
German B-TER

somewhat O
similar O
measures B-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
, O
Jugoslavia B-LOC
, O
Bulgaria B-LOC
and O
unoccupied B-TER

. O

There O
appears O
, O
consequently O
, O
to O
be O
a O
definite O
program O
of O
carrying O
German B-TER
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitism I-TER
beyond O
the O
German B-TER
