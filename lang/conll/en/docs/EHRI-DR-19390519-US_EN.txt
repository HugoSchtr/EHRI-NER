The O
Department O
will O
note O
that O
the O
law B-TER
was O
modified O
substantially O
. O

Primarily O
, O
the O
class O
of O
Jews B-TER
to O
be O
considered O
officially O
as O
Christians B-TER
was O
enlarged O
but O
its O
economic B-TER
restrictions I-TER
were O
increased O
, O
thus O
creating O
a O
sort O
of O
second O
- O
class O
citizenship O
. O

This O
represents O
the O
real O
compromise O
made O
between O
the O
two O
houses B-ORG
of I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
. O

Also O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
placing O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
a O
distinct B-TER
category I-TER
for O
political O
purposes O
was O
discarded O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
retain O
free O
active O
and O
passive O
suffrage O
, O
but O
the O
conditions O
of O
their O
enfranchisement B-TER
were O
made O
much O
more O
severe O
. O

Agricultural O
property O
may O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
Jews B-TER
, O
their O
right O
to O
acquire O
real O
estate O
is O
limited O
, O
and O
the O
restriction O
of O
their O
employment O
is O
greatly O
increased O
. O

Jewish B-TER
journalists I-TER
complain O
bitterly O
against O
the O
special O
press B-TER
restriction B-TER
by O
which O
the O
law B-TER
was O
amended O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
Jewish B-TER
youth O
will O
suffer O
the O
most O
. O
