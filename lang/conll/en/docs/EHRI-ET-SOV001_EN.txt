This O
happened O
on O
one O
of O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
murderous O
attack O
from O
the O
German B-TER
planes O
on O
the O
almost O
unprotected O
city O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
– O
in O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
month O
of O
September O
1939 O
. O

By O
chance O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
Żoliborz B-LOC
around O
the O
school B-TER
of O
the O
streetcar O
workers O
’ O
union O
. O

The O
air O
was O
pierced O
by O
the O
heart O
- O
rending O
shouting O
of O
sirenes O
. O

The O
approaching O
of O
German B-TER
planes O
were O
announced O
. O

This O
time O
, O
they O
targeted O
the O
beautifully O
built O
neighborhood O
of O
Żoliborz B-LOC
. O

Seven O
bombers O
with O
yellow B-TER
swastika I-TER
on O
their O
snooty O
tails O
dropped O
frank O
and O
free O
incendiary O
and O
fougasse O
bombs O
on O
top O
of O
the O
residences O
of O
peaceful O
and O
unprotected O
workers O
, O
employees O
, O
and O
clerks O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
gateway O
and O
suddenly O
heard O
a O
deafening O
bursting O
detonation O
. O

Pieces O
of O
violet O
fire O
sparkled O
in O
front O
of O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
soon O
an O
enormous O
cloud O
of O
smoke O
arose O
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
on O
the O
school B-TER
of O
the O
streetcar O
workers O
’ O
union O
, O
a O
fougasse O
bomb O
was O
thrown O
. O

Children B-TER
ran O
out O
of O
the O
collapsing O
building O
– O
disconcerted O
, O
tearful O
, O
bloody O
. O

The O
children B-TER
ran O
together O
in O
one O
direction O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
several O
planes O
descended O
. O

And O
there O
, O
they O
are O
already O
flying O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
children B-TER
. O

And O
something O
happened O
that O
freezes O
the O
blood O
in O
one O
’s O
veins O
. O

The O
German B-TER
murderers B-TER
, O
who O
saw O
the O
escaping B-TER
children B-TER
very O
well O
from O
the O
short O
distance O
that O
separated O
them O
from O
the O
earth O
, O
looked O
out O
from O
their O
seats O
in O
the O
planes O
, O
aimed O
their O
machine O
guns O
at O
the O
compressed O
group O
of O
children B-TER
, O
flew O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
hailed O
the O
children B-TER
with O
hundreds O
of O
murderous O
blows O
. O

The O
flight O
of O
the O
air O
- O
murderers O
hovering O
back O
and O
forth O
over O
the O
group O
of O
the O
dozens O
of O
children B-TER
lasted O
for O
ten O
minutes O
– O
this O
was O
sufficient O
to O
have O
each O
and O
every O
child B-TER
lying O
in O
puddles O
of O
blood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
. O

On O
the O
street O
, O
some O
grown O
- O
ups O
were O
running O
as O
well O
while O
the O
German B-TER
planes O
were O
descending O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
bandits O
avoided O
the O
grown O
- O
ups O
, O
however O
, O
and O
deliberately O
shot B-TER
at O
the O
children B-TER
. O

* O
* O
* O
My O
wife B-TER
went O
to O
bring O
water O
from O
the O
well O
: O
the O
pipes O
were O
destroyed O
by O
the O
bombs O
of O
the O
enemies O
. O

The O
well O
was O
located O
on O
the O
Catholic B-TER
cemetery I-TER
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
Powązki B-LOC
on O
Yablonska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

At O
the O
well O
, O
an O
enormous O
queue O
of O
women B-TER
was O
standing O
, O
each O
one O
with O
a O
bucket O
, O
with O
a O
cups O
, O
with O
teapots O
. O

An O
air O
raid O
occurred O
. O

The O
women B-TER
hugged O
one O
another O
and O
looked O
up O
into O
the O
sky O
with O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
a O
heart O
- O
rending O
wailing O
broke O
out O
. O

Five O
German B-TER
planes O
descended O
very O
low O
over O
the O
cemetery B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
started O
to O
frantically O
run O
to O
all O
sides O
, O
looking O
for O
protection O
in O
the O
bushes O
, O
between O
the O
graves O
. O

But O
planes O
were O
flying O
close O
over O
their O
heads O
and O
shot B-TER
directly O
at O
the O
women B-TER
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
at O
the O
right O
side O
from O
the O
place O
where O
my O
wife B-TER
was O
standing O
, O
a O
woman B-TER
fell O
from O
a O
bullet O
. O

From O
the O
left O
side O
, O
a O
plane O
descended O
so O
low O
so O
that O
the O
murderous O
pilot O
hit O
the O
head O
of O
an O
elderly O
woman B-TER
with O
a O
wing O
and O
killed B-TER
her O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

After O
the O
Fascist B-ORG
army I-ORG
invaded O
Warsaw B-LOC
, O
some O
of O
their O
pilots O
bragged O
: O
We O
did O
n’t O
even O
let O
them O
scoop O
water O
on O
the O
cemetery O
in O
Powązki O
! O
At O
that O
time O
at O
the O
well O
, O
several O
dozen O
women B-TER
died B-TER
. O

* O
* O
* O
All O
of O
these O
troubles O
was O
nothing O
against O
what O
the O
National O
Socialist O
pimps O
and O
murderers B-TER
did O
later O
on O
. O

Whoever O
got O
away O
with O
a O
one O
- O
day O
work B-TER
- I-TER
assignment I-TER
of O
tearing B-TER
out I-TER
stones I-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
cobblestone I-TER
pavement I-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
street I-TER
, O
or O
of O
carrying B-TER
water I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
horses I-TER
, O
or O
of O
cleaning B-TER
toilets I-TER
with I-TER
the I-TER
hands I-TER
and O
thereby O
catching O
some O
dry O
blows O
was O
a O
lucky O
one O
. O

Whoever O
got O
out O
alive O
from O
under O
the O
predatory O
claws O
, O
which O
took O
off O
the O
shoes B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
coat B-TER
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street O
, O
may O
recite O
goyml O
blessing O
recited O
in O
the O
synagogue O
after O
escaping O
a O
great O
danger O
. O

. O

Whoever O
was O
dragged O
out O
off O
his O
home O
to O
go O
to O
work O
to O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
Polish O
Parliament O
. O

, O
would O
say O
goodbye O
to O
their O
wife B-TER
and O
children B-TER
anticipating O
that O
he O
wo O
n’t O
be O
coming O
back O
home O
again O
. O

The O
large O
building O
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
on O
Wiejska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
was O
partly O
destroyed O
from O
the O
bombs O
of O
the O
enemy O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
dragged O
there O
whole O
groups O
of O
Warsaw B-LOC
residents O
for O
them O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
building I-TER
. O

Through O
small O
streets O
off O
the O
beaten O
paths O
, O
I O
went O
to O
my O
acquaintance O
L.Sh O
. O

, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
publishing O
house O
Tomor O
. O

He O
lived O
on O
Leszno B-LOC
Street I-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
time O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
avoid O
bumping O
into O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
face O
- O
to O
- O
face O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
two O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
armed O
with O
rifles O
were O
standing O
directly O
in O
front O
of O
the O
yard O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
as O
if O
they O
had O
suddenly O
grown O
out O
of O
the O
earth O
. O

They O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
to O
me O
, O
only O
one O
of O
them O
called O
me O
over O
with O
his O
finger O
. O

I O
walked O
over O
. O

Your O
profession O
? O
– O
he O
asked O
me O
. O

I O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
, O
of O
course O
, O
that O
I O
am O
a O
writer B-TER
. O

A O
teacher O
, O
I O
said O
. O

If O
so O
, O
you O
will O
be O
going O
with O
the O
group O
designated O
to O
work O
in O
the O
Sejm O
, O
– O
the O
German B-TER
said O
. O

There O
you O
will O
elevate O
your O
pedagogical O
qualifications O
, O
he O
added O
with O
a O
poisonous O
smile O
. O

For O
a O
moment O
, O
I O
stood O
there O
confused O
. O

The O
German B-TER
gave O
the O
order O
not O
clear O
. O

Forward O
March O
! O
and O
gave O
my O
behind O
the O
tip O
of O
his O
boot O
. O

I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
neighboring O
Smotshe B-LOC
Street I-LOC
where O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
was O
already O
standing O
– O
in O
rows O
of O
two O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
I O
also O
saw O
my O
acquaintance O
– O
the O
journalist B-TER
Sh O
. O

G. O
A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
we O
were O
escorted O
to O
Wiejska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
inside O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
large O
corridor O
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
lobby O
of O
a O
legislative O
building O
. O

, O
we O
were O
assembled O
and O
an O
officer B-TER
, O
a O
young O
one O
, O
approximately O
twenty O
three O
or O
twenty O
four O
years O
old O
, O
held O
a O
speech O
in O
front O
of O
us O
about O
the O
work B-TER
regulations O
. O

The O
content O
of O
the O
speech O
was O
roughly O
as O
follows O
: O
– O
We O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
, O
will O
teach O
you O
how O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Throughout O
the O
working B-TER
time O
you O
will O
have O
to O
be O
standing O
bend O
over O
. O

If O
you O
straighten O
your O
back O
, O
if O
you O
look O
around O
, O
if O
you O
interrupt O
your O
work B-TER
, O
you O
will O
receive O
the O
hardest O
punishment O
– O
from O
punches O
to O
execution B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

You O
will O
be O
working B-TER
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Food B-TER
will O
not O
be O
provided O
. O

Before O
you O
go O
home O
, O
everyone O
will O
get O
a O
sip O
of O
water O
so O
you O
wo O
n’t O
be O
thirsty O
. O

During O
the O
working O
hours O
, O
German B-TER
soldier B-TER
might O
come O
in O
and O
shout O
: O
Heil O
Hitler O
! O
– O
As O
soon O
as O
you O
hear O
this O
, O
you O
have O
to O
drop O
, O
fall O
with O
your O
face O
to O
the O
floor O
and O
immediately O
move O
again O
, O
get O
up O
and O
cry O
out O
: O
Heil O
Hitler O
! O
, O
and O
then O
fall O
to O
the O
floor O
again O
; O
after O
that O
, O
you O
have O
to O
get O
up O
and O
get O
back O
to O
work B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
lobby I-TER
of O
the O
Sejm B-LOC
– O
taking O
out O
pieces O
of O
chalk O
, O
broken O
glass O
, O
dirt O
. O

We O
were O
afraid O
to O
straighten O
our O
backs O
and O
look O
around O
. O

Our O
backs O
hurt O
really O
bad O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
we O
heard O
a O
shot B-TER
right O
beside O
us O
. O

Several O
straightened O
their O
backs O
out O
of O
fear O
and O
looked O
around O
. O

Soon O
enough O
, O
a O
second O
and O
third O
shot O
was O
heard O
. O

Two O
men O
were O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
because O
they O
straightened O
their O
backs O
and O
looked O
around O
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
no O
one O
of O
us O
could O
really O
know O
, O
what O
was O
going O
on O
around O
us O
. O

Only O
the O
next O
day O
I O
learned O
that O
my O
acquaintance O
, O
the O
journalist B-TER
Sh O
. O

G. O
, O
got O
out O
as O
a O
cripple O
. O

For O
one O
second O
, O
he O
rested O
and O
wiped O
away O
the O
sweat O
with O
his O
sleeve O
and O
immediately O
a O
bandit O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
up O
to O
him O
and O
hit O
him O
with O
a O
whip O
directly O
at O
his O
eyes O
. O

Sh O
. O

G. O
wears O
glasses O
– O
the O
spectacles O
glasses O
burst O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
glass O
went O
into O
his O
eye O
. O

And O
in O
this O
way O
, O
bloody O
and O
weakened O
, O
he O
had O
to O
carry O
bricks O
and O
dirt O
. O

There O
was O
no O
end O
to O
the O
Heil O
Hitler O
. O

Every O
few O
minutes O
, O
another O
soldier B-TER
came O
in O
and O
yelled O
the O
verse O
. O

We O
had O
to O
immediately O
throw O
ourselves O
to O
the O
floor O
, O
on O
the O
pointed O
pieces O
of O
brick O
and O
pointed O
bundles O
of O
wires O
. O

My O
face O
turned O
red O
, O
smeared O
with O
blood O
and O
dirt O
, O
my O
hands O
– O
black O
pieces O
of O
congealed O
blood O
. O

Since O
not O
everyone O
replied O
Heil O
Hitler O
as O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
up O
with O
a O
special O
punishment O
for O
us O
. O

While O
we O
were O
standing O
like O
that O
bent O
over O
and O
worked O
almost O
unconsciously O
, O
they O
pierced O
us O
from O
behind O
with O
spears O
and O
bayonets O
– O
to O
turn O
around O
, O
as O
mentioned O
, O
meant O
to O
catch O
a O
bullet O
in O
your O
head O
on O
the O
spot O
. O

Many O
lost O
consciousness O
and O
fell O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
them O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

Night O
fell O
. O

The O
young O
officer B-TER
came O
in O
again O
. O

He O
commanded O
us O
to O
stop O
working B-TER
and O
to O
get O
into O
several O
rows O
. O

– O
Now O
, O
you O
will O
get O
a O
drink O
of O
water O
. O

You O
should O
freshen O
up O
after O
work B-TER
– O
he O
said O
. O

Our O
palates O
were O
dry O
and O
really O
dried O
up O
like O
pieces O
of O
hard O
leather O
. O

Close O
to O
fainting O
and O
bloody O
, O
we O
were O
standing O
there O
in O
our O
ripped O
clothes B-TER
and O
waited O
for O
the O
little O
bit O
of O
water O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
stood O
there O
with O
a O
sincere O
and O
solemn O
look O
on O
his O
face O
. O

Several O
dozen O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
in O
. O

No O
water O
was O
brought O
to O
us O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
ordered O
us O
to O
sit O
down O
for O
a O
moment O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
hardly O
standing O
up O
anyways O
on O
our O
bended O
knees O
. O

He O
ordered O
that O
we O
lift O
our O
heads O
up O
and O
open O
our O
mouths O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
a O
sign O
to O
the O
SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
. O

SS B-ORG
men I-ORG
came O
up O
to O
groups O
of O
three O
, O
unbuttoned O
their O
trousers O
, O
and O
pissed O
directly O
into O
our O
mouths O
. O

We O
started O
to O
choke O
, O
throw O
up O
, O
spit O
. O

Then O
the O
German B-TER
took O
out O
revolvers O
and O
threatened O
to O
shoot B-TER
anyone O
who O
would O
not O
swallow O
the O
pure O
Aryan B-TER
urine O
. O

After O
that O
we O
were O
ordered O
to O
say O
: O
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
far O
the O
fresh O
drink O
! O
At O
the O
end O
, O
the O
officer B-TER
gave O
another O
speech O
that O
in O
this O
way O
we O
will O
learn O
how O
to O
work B-TER
, O
that O
every O
one O
of O
us O
has O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
announced O
that O
we O
are O
released O
and O
can O
run O
home O
– O
yes O
, O
run O
! O
He O
prohibited O
us O
to O
walk O
, O
– O
only O
to O
run O
. O

Since O
it O
was O
already O
late O
at O
night O
, O
after O
7 O
pm O
– O
i.e. O
already O
after B-TER
the I-TER
point I-TER
, I-TER
when I-TER
we I-TER
were I-TER
allowed I-TER
to I-TER
be I-TER
outside I-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
street I-TER
, O
one O

to O
the O
officer B-TER
asking O
for O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
, O
some O
form O
of O
permit O
, O
so O
we O
would O
n’t O
run O
into O

on O
our O
way O
home O
. O

The O
officer B-TER
got O
really O
angry O
, O
took O
out O
his O
revolver O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
immediately O
run O
home O
– O
if O

, O
he O
will O
shoot B-TER
everyone O

In O
the O

an O
acquaintance O
, O
who O
lived O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
Marshalkovska B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
under O
bitter O
tears O
how O
drunken O
Germans B-TER
raped B-TER
her O
two O
daughters B-TER
and O
several O
other O
daughters B-TER
of O
her O
neighbors O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Hitlerites B-TER
entered O
the O
apartment O
and O
ordered O
all O
elderly O
residents O
to O
leave O
the O
apartment O
immediately O
. O

The O
two O
young O
girls B-TER
, O
one O
20 O
years O
old O
and O
the O
other O
17 O
years O
old O

They O
tore O
off O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
from O
the O
girls B-TER
and O
one O
after O
the O
other O
committed B-TER
acts I-TER
of I-TER
violence I-TER
against I-TER
them I-TER
. O

The O
desperate O
cries O
from O
the O
unfortunate O
girls B-TER
mixed O
with O
loud O
laughter O
of O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
. O

In O
order O
to O
scare O
off O
the O
neighbors O
so O
that O
they O
wo O
n’t O
run O
out O
of O
their O
apartments O
and O
make O
a O
scene O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
shot O
into O
the O

several O
times O
. O

After O
they O
had O
raped B-TER
the O
girls B-TER
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
animals O
took O
away O
all O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
clothes B-TER
, O
from O
the O
blouses B-TER
to O
the O
coats B-TER
, O
so O
that O
the O
girls B-TER
had O
to O
remain O
laying O
naked O
. O

Before O
they O
left O
, O
they O
announced O
that O
they O
will O
come O
again O
tomorrow O
evening O
and O
that O
the O
house O
should O
supply O
several O
fresh O

On O

next O
day O
, O
all O
girls B-TER
and O
young O
women B-TER
of O
the O
house O
hid B-TER
somewhere O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
rapists B-TER
came O

They O
got O
really O
angry O
when O
they O
did O
not O
meet O
any O
young O
women B-TER
. O

They O
took O
out O
the O

which O
usually O
tries O
cases O
every O

. O

The O
two O
elderly O
women B-TER
were O
charged O
with O
resisting O
the O
decrees B-TER
of O
the O
German B-TER
power O
. O

Both O
of O
them O
were O
sent O

* O
* O
At O
first O
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
snapped O
up O
for O

Soon O
enough O
, O
they O
started O
to O
catch O
women B-TER
as O
well O
. O

Once O
– O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
October O
– O
my O

Perl O
L. O
( O
she O
lived O
on O
Nizko B-LOC

) O
, O
a O
young O
thirty O
three O
year O
old O
woman B-TER
, O
was O
among O
those O
who O
got O
caught O
. O

A O
group O
of O
caught O
women B-TER
– O
for O
most O
part O
young O
women B-TER
– O
were O
led O
into O
a O
large O
shared O
apartment O
of O
Hitlerites B-TER
. O

They O
were O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
up I-TER
the I-TER
apartment I-TER
, O
to O
do B-TER
the I-TER
laundry I-TER
and O
to O
darn B-TER
the I-TER
socks I-TER
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
youth O
started O
to O
insult O
the O
women B-TER
in O
a O
mean O
refined O
way O
. O

My O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
together O
with O
several O
others O
was O
led O
into O
a O
large O
room O
and O
ordered O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
. O

They O
were O
not O
given O
any O
rags O
to O
clean O
with O
, O
instead O
they O
were O
ordered O
to O
take O
off O
their O
underwear B-TER
and O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
with I-TER
it I-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
had O
to O
undress O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
. O

The O
young O
Hitlerites B-TER
stood O
there O
and O
made O
professional O
, O
cynical O
remarks O
about O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
uncovered O
limbs O
just O
like O
experienced O
pimps O
. O

The O
women B-TER
put O
on O
the O
dresses B-TER
on O
their O
naked O
bodies O
and O
started O
to O
clean B-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
with O
their O
underwear B-TER
. O

After O
several O
minutes O
, O
they O
received O
the O
order O
to O
lift O
up O
the O
dresses B-TER
over O
their O
bellies O
during O
the O
work B-TER
. O

The O
degenerate O
person O
in O
charge O
provided O
a O
explanation O
for O
his O
command O
: O
We O
will O
teach O
you O
how O
to O
work O
in O
a O
cultured O
manner O
. O

When O
you O
rub O
a O
floor O
, O
you O
have O
to O
take O
good O
care O
of O
your O
dress O
. O

The O
horrific O
torture B-TER
commenced O
only O
now O
. O

Every O
few O
minutes O
, O
new O
scoundrels O
came O
in O
in O
a O
soldier B-TER
’s I-TER
uniform O
and O
threw O
a O
woman B-TER
to O
the O
floor O
, O
into O
the O
dirty O
water O
. O

Pointing O
the O
revolver O
at O
her O
, O
they O
ordered O
them O
to O
lift O
their O
legs O
, O
shone O
into O
their O
vaginas O
with O
little O
electric O
lamps O
and O
threatened O
that O
, O
if O
the O
women B-TER
would O
not O
let O
themselves O
be O
examined O
, O
they O
will O
be O
raped B-TER
. O

After O
the O
cleaning B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
floor I-TER
was O
done O
, O
the O
women B-TER
were O
forced O
to O
put O
on O
their O
bodies O
the O
sopping O
wet O
, O
dirty O
and O
muddy O
rags O
of O
underwear B-TER
. O

With O
even O
more O
impudence O
and O
brutality O
, O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
scoundrels O
carried O
out O
inspections O
of O
women B-TER
at O
the O
German B-TER
- O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

Hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
war B-TER
refugees B-TER
from O
the O
German B-TER
- O
Polish B-TER
war B-TER
ran O
away O
from O
Hitler B-PER
to O
the O
new O
Soviet B-TER
border B-TER
. O

My O
wife B-TER
was O
among O
the O
refugees B-TER
( O
at O
that O
time O
, O
I O
was O
already O
in O
Soviet B-TER
Białystok B-LOC
) O
. O

At O
the O
border B-TER
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
carried O
out O
an O
inspection O
– O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
separate O
from O
one O
another O
. O

The O
border B-TER
inspection O
of O
women B-TER
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
horrific O
inventions O
of O
the O
Hitlerite B-TER
rapists B-TER
. O

They O
ordered O
the O
women B-TER
to O
get O
naked O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
field O
in O
front O
of O
the O
eyes O
of O
thousands O
of O
passer O
- O
bys O
. O

The O
Hitlerite B-TER
border B-TER
guard O
, O
of O
course O
, O
saw O
that O
the O
women B-TER
did O
not O
have O
anything O
on O
them O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
he O
groped O
about O
the O
naked O
women B-TER
brutally O
and O
cynically O
and O
handed O
them O
over O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
second O
soldier B-TER
. O

At O
the O
end O
, O
the O
main O
procedure O
took O
place O
. O

Every O
naked O
woman B-TER
had O
to O
go O
to O
an O
officer B-TER
, O
open O
her O
legs O
and O
bend O
over O
. O

The O
officer O
shone O
into O
her O
vagina O
with O
a O
little O
electric O
lamp O
and O
turned O
a O
stick O
inside O
ostensibly O
looking O
for O
diamonds O
or O
forbidden O
documents O
. O

This O
happened O
on O
October O
20 O
, O
1939 O
, O
on O
an O
open O
field O
in O
front O
of O
the O
eyes O

thousands O
of O
people O
