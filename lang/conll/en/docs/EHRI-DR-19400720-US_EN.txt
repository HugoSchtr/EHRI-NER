I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
Ambassador B-TER
Stoica B-PER
, O
formerly O
Ambassador B-TER
at O
Ankara B-LOC
and O
now O
Under O
Secretary B-TER
of I-TER
Propaganda I-TER
, O
told O
me O
the O
other O
evening O
at O
dinner O
at O
my O
house O
in O
honor O
of O
himself O
and O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
newspapers B-TER
, O
that O
his O
Government B-ORG
was O
going O
to O
do O
everything O
within O
its O
power O
to O
prevent O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
outbreaks I-TER
, O
but O
that O
it O
greatly O
feared O
such O
outbreaks B-TER
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Army B-TER
as O
the O
latter O
was O
so O
incensed O
at O
the O
treatment O
meted O
out O
to O
it O
by O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
when O
it O
was O
withdrawing O
. O

I O
observed O
that O
for O
once O
Rumania B-LOC
had O
a O
good O
press B-TER
in O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
where O
there O
was O
great O
sympathy O
because O
it O
had O
been O
set O
upon O
by O
a O
powerful O
nation O
of O
180,000,000 O
people O
, O
and O
that O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
sacrifice O
this O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
Pogrom B-TER
or O
two O
. O

On O
another O
recent O
occasion O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
informally O
to O
emphasize O
to O
Prime B-TER
Minister I-TER
Gigurtu B-PER
that O
any O
internal O
disturbance O
, O
especially O
Jewish B-TER
persecution I-TER
, O
might O
easily O
be O
seized O
upon O
by O
Russia B-LOC
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
further O
action O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Gigurtu B-PER
group O
maintains O
that O
to O
pass O
rigid O
laws B-TER
against I-TER
Jews I-TER
at O
the O
present O
critical O
moment O
would O
seriously O
affect O
the O
economic B-TER
structure I-TER
of O
the O
State O
, O
as O
well O
as O
create O
a O
most O
unfortunate O
impression B-TER
among O
nations O
abroad O
, O
particularly O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Some O
observers O
take O
the O
view O
that O
should O
there O
be O
no O
further O
pressure O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Bulgaria B-LOC
for O
territorial O
cession O
at O
present O
the O
moderate O
group O
will O
win O
its O
point O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
strong O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
reaction I-TER
in O
Rumania B-LOC
; O
if O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Government O
is O
forced O
to O
cede O
more O
territory O
immediately O
, O
a O
cession O
for O
which O
public B-TER
opinion I-TER
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
prepared O
, O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
thesis O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
win O
because O
the O
Government O
will O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
resort O
to O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
agitation I-TER
as O
a O
cloak O
and O
counter O
- O
irritant O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
a O
few O
mild O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measures I-TER
have O
been O
announced O
but O
nothing O
to O
suggest O
a O
really O
vicious O
program O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
I O
accordingly O
feel O
that O
no O
really O
strong O
Jewish B-TER
persecutions I-TER
are O
apt O
to O
eventuate O
in O
the O
near O
future O
except O
as O
they O
may O
arise O
out O
of O
new O
circumstances O
created O
by O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
events O
or O
further O
dissatisfaction O
in O
the O
Army B-TER
. O
