The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
My O
father B-TER
was O
a O
joiner O
, O
he O
died O
8 O
years O
ago O
. O

My O
mother B-TER
, O
my O
older O
brother B-TER
, O
my O
younger O
brother B-TER
, O
and O
older O
sister B-TER
with O
her O
5 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son O
were O
deported B-TER
into O
Poland B-LOC
in O
1941 O
( O
the O
15th O
May O
) O
. O

When O
it O
happened O
I O
stayed O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
to O
arrange O
for O
the O
documents O
needed O
for O
citizenship B-TER
. O

Three O
months O
later O
my O
brother O
managed O
to O
come O
home O
after O
a O
trip O
full O
of O
hardship O
. O

Around O
70 O
% O
of O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
village O
were O
deported B-TER
this O
time O
, O
only O
the O
widows O
of O
soldiers O
and O
relatives O
of O
labour O
servicemen O
remained O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
forced O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
through O
the O
border O
at O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
. O

One O
time O
Hungarian B-TER
, O
another O
time O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
beat B-TER
them O
, O
elderly O
people O
were O
either O
shot B-TER
or O
thrown O
into O
the O
river O
Dnester B-LOC
. O

They O
shot B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
in O
front O
of O
my O
brother B-TER
who O
managed O
to O
come O
back O
from O
death B-TER
’s O
door O
. O

He O
was O
interned O
for O
a O
year O
till O
his O
documents O
arrived O
but O
after O
another O
year O
his O
fate O
was O
decided O
, O
whe O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
brought O
about O
another O
turn O
in O
the O
life O
of O
Jews O
. O

It O
was O
now O
that O
I O
got O
to O
Somogyvár B-LOC
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
’s I-TER
place O
. O

Naturally O
, O
everything O
started O
also O
here O
with O
wearing O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
. O

After O
a O
thorough O
search B-TER
on O
the O
18th O
of O
May O
we O
were O
carried O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
of O
Tab B-LOC
travelling O
like O
a O
caravan O
of O
Gipsies B-TER
as O
we O
could O
carry O
along O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

Here O
they O
designated B-TER
only O
one O
street O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

This O
was O
enclosed O
, O
guarded O
by O
Jewish B-TER
policemen I-TER
inside O
and O
by O
military B-TER
gendarmes I-TER
outside O
. O

There O
were O
around O
200 O
Jewish O
families B-TER
crammed B-TER
here O
, O
20 O
- O
30 O
living O
in O
one O
room O
, O
we O
could O
hardly O
lie O
down O
. O

We O
also O
had O
a O
soup O
kitchen O
but O
who O
had O
some O
food O
supply O
preferred O
to O
cook O
at O
home O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
were O
Weisz B-PER
, O
Szirmai B-PER
, O
etc O
. O

; O
we O
had O
no O
complains O
about O
them O
. O

Till O
the O
age O
of O
50 O
everyone O
had O
to O
work B-TER
here O
, O
they O
took O
us O
for O
agricultural O
work O
, O
for O
construction O
works O
, O
we O
built O
a O
levente O
centre O
. O

The O
peasants B-TER
of O
Tab B-LOC
did O
not O
want O
the O
ghetto B-TER
to O
be O
built O
there O
, O
therefore O
, O
debates O
about O
the O
ghetto B-TER
lasted O
for O
long O
but O
the O
notary O
of O
the O
community O
, O
who O
was O
a O
notorious O
antisemite B-TER
, O
and O
had O
lot O
of O
land O
wanted O
free O
Jewish O
labour B-TER
force I-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
but O
also O
wanted O
to O
show O
off O
with O
the O
levente O
centre O
. O

We O
were O
distributed O
on O
different O
estates O
of O
the O
area O
, O
we O
worked B-TER
from O
Monday O
morning O
till O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
then O
we O
returned O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
by O
cars O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
but O
did O
not O
have O
a O
bad O
life O
as O
food B-TER
was O
very O
good O
in O
all O
manors O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we O
finished O
the O
work O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
estates O
Dr. B-PER
Gusztáv I-PER
Götzen I-PER
did O
not O
pay O
his O
Jewish O
labourers B-TER
. O

No O
one O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
recall O
the O
death B-TER
of O
anyone O
. O

The O
3rd O
of O
July O
, O
we O
received O
the O
order O
to O
pack O
and O
the O
day O
after O
we O
already O
set O
off O
. O

We O
could O
carry O
15 O
kilos O
of O
luggage O
. O

When O
we O
were O
searched B-TER
by O
Hungarian B-TER
soldiers O
and O
by O
gendarmes B-TER
we O
had O
to O
undress O
nude O
. O

My O
friend O
wanted O
to O
save O
a O
little O
jar O
of O
apricot B-TER
jam I-TER
for O
her O
daughter O
but O
the O
gendarme B-TER
performing O
the O
search O
noticed O
it O
and O
seized B-TER
it O
, O
together O
with O
a O
ball O
saying O
that O
his O
son O
would O
use O
it O
. O

When O
they O
finished O
searching O
us O
they O
entrained B-TER
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
the O
court O
of O
the O
army O
station O
in O
Kaposvár B-LOC
where O
ca O
. O

7,000 O
people O
were O
concentrated B-TER
. O

We O
stayed O
here O
for O
five O
days O
till O
we O
were O
entrained B-TER
, O
90 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
wagon B-TER
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
water O
at O
start O
but O
almost O
nothing O
on O
German B-TER
territories O
. O

We O
had O
a O
bucket O
for O
toilet O
in O
the O
car O
. O

Two O
old O
women B-TER
died B-TER
during O
the O
journey O
, O
we O
had O
their O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
in O
the O
car O
until O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
miracle O
that O
only O
two O
old O
women B-TER
died B-TER
since O
the O
heat O
was O
almost O
unbearable O
in O
the O
open O
wagons B-TER
. O

In O
Kassa B-LOC
gendarmes B-TER
got O
into O
the O
wagons O
and O
told O
us O
to O
have O
patience O
and O
not O
to O
commit O
suicide B-TER
, O
we O
would O
be O
carried O
into O
Germany B-TER
where O
we O
would O
live O
well O
, O
there O
were O
going O
to O
be O
cinemas O
and O
theatres O
there O
, O
we O
only O
needed O
to O
work O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
the O
third O
night O
, O
we O
almost O
respired O
with O
relief O
after O
this O
awful O
journey O
although O
we O
did O
not O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
next O
. O

Häftlings B-TER
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
came O
up O
in O
the O
wagons O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
get O
off O
and O
to O
leave O
all O
our O
stuff O
in O
the O
car O
. O

When O
we O
queued O
up O
five O
in O
each O
line O
the O
SS B-TER
selected B-TER
us O
. O

We O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
about O
I O
could O
not O
even O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
when O
they O
took O
me O
into O
the O
baths O
, O
cut O
my O
hair O
, O
depilated O
me O
, O
and O
put O
me O
under O
cold O
shower O
. O

We O
were O
so O
weary O
that O
I O
was O
close O
to O
feeling O
well O
after O
the O
shower O
and O
did O
not O
care O
about O
my O
hair O
any O
more O
. O

They O
took O
our O
clothes B-TER
and O
gave O
us O
instead O
blouses B-TER
and O
long B-TER
skirts I-TER
and O
put O
a O
cross O
in O
red O
ink O
on O
the O
back O
. O

If O
the O
blouse B-TER
was O
thin O
the O
ink O
filtered O
through O
and O
ate O
into O
the O
skin O
. O

After O
the O
bath O
, O
I O
got O
into O
lager B-TER
B I-TER
where O
we O
were O
800 O
of O
us O
divided O
in O
two O
barracks O
. O

There O
were O
not O
even O
berths O
here O
, O
we O
sat B-TER
on I-TER
the I-TER
ground I-TER
cluttered O
up O
, O
lying O
was O
out O
of O
question O
of O
course O
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
this O
was O
the O
worst O
barrack O
, O
the O
rain B-TER
constantly I-TER
fell I-TER
in I-TER
. O

Apart O
for O
roll B-TER
calls I-TER
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
, O
this O
was O
what O
filled O
our O
days O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
got O
black B-TER
coffee I-TER
, O
at O
8 O
am O
some O
grass O
- O
like O
soup B-TER
which O
I O
never O
tasted O
during O
the O
time O
I O
was O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
a O
little O
piece O
of O
bread O
and O
Zulag B-TER
. O

The O
7th O
of O
August O
, O
I O
was O
selected B-TER
for O
a O
group O
meant O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Lichteanu B-LOC
. O

The O
journey O
took O
us O
three O
days O
and O
we O
received O
sufficient O
bread B-TER
and O
sausage B-TER
for O
these O
days O
. O

We O
travelled O
60 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
car O
and O
when O
we O
arrived O
to O
Lichtenau B-LOC
I O
was O
very O
glad O
we O
got O
into O
a O
relatively O
clean O
camp B-TER
. O

Everyone O
had O
a O
place O
to O
sleep O
, O
a O
blanket B-TER
, O
and O
even O
a O
cup O
and O
a O
spoon O
, O
so O
we O
started O
to O
feel O
like O
civilised O
people O
again O
. O

Our O
job B-TER
was O
to O
fill O
18 O
kilos O
heavy O
grenades O
in O
the O
ammunition O
plant O
and O
to O
help O
entraining O
the O
goods O
. O

We O
had O
to O
prepare O
around O
2,000 O
- O
2,500 O
pieces O
a O
day O
rushed O
by O
the O
masters O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
8 O
hours O
a O
day O
but O
in O
some O
special O
fields O
people O
had O
to O
work B-TER
12 O
hours O
. O

Every O
three O
weeks O
we O
changed O
shift O
; O
there O
were O
morning O
, O
afternoon O
and O
night O
shifts O
. O

Some O
masters O
beat O
us O
but O
generally O
all O
rushed O
us O
shouting O
Los O
, O
los O
. O

In O
December O
, O
there O
was O
less O
work B-TER
to O
do O
as O
we O
ran O
out O
of O
raw O
material O
, O
hence O
we O
were O
sent O
for O
forest B-TER
work I-TER
. O

This O
was O
much O
worse O
, O
we O
walked O
to O
the O
mountains O
in O
knee O
- O
high O
snow O
to O
work O
with O
the O
pickaxe O
and O
it O
was O
often O
already O
10 O
pm O
when O
we O
got O
back O
to O
the O
lager O
. O

We O
walked O
15 O
kilometres O
far O
away O
in O
wooden O
slippers O
in O
which O
we O
hardly O
could O
walk O
. O

January O
the O
15th O
, O
we O
started O
working B-TER
again O
in O
the O
plant O
. O

We O
were O
very O
happy O
about O
it O
as O
we O
stopped O
having O
cold O
even O
if O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
hard O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
March O
, O
Americans B-ORG
were O
getting O
closer O
so O
they O
hurriedly O
put O
us O
on O
trains B-TER
, O
100 O
in O
each O
freight O
car O
, O
and O
gave O
us O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
each O
. O

We O
spent O
six O
days O
and O
nights O
in O
the O
cars O
, O
the O
officer O
who O
came O
with O
us O
could O
not O
decide O
where O
to O
land O
with O
us O
, O
till O
we O
arrived O
to O
Leipzig B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
got O
off O
and O
spent O
three O
weeks O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
. O

Americans B-ORG
got O
closer O
again O
, O
so O
we O
left O
Leipzig B-LOC
and O
walked O
three O
weeks O
by O
day O
and O
night O
. O

We O
slept O
on O
the O
fields O
in O
the O
open O
, O
in O
rain O
and O
cold O
, O
we O
got O
every O
second O
day O
some O
pieces O
of O
cooked O
potatoes B-TER
, O
the O
skilful O
could O
obtain O
some O
raw O
ones O
but O
most O
importantly O
we O
ate O
the O
sorrel B-TER
of O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
we O
had O
to O
suffer O
even O
for O
the O
sorrel O
as O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
bitch I-TER
beat B-TER
us O
if O
she O
caught O
us O
. O

A O
day O
before O
the O
liberation B-TER
a O
little O
girl O
went O
into O
a O
peasant O
yard O
to O
have O
a O
rest O
in O
the O
pigpen O
and O
therefore O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

We O
did O
not O
see O
bread B-TER
during O
these O
three O
weeks O
. O

Americans B-ORG
liberated B-TER
us O
the O
27th O
of O
April O
at O
Wurtzen B-LOC
, O
where O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
following O
three O
weeks O
and O
rejoiced O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
good O
food B-TER
so O
we O
made O
up O
for O
the O
hunger B-TER
we O
had O
before O
. O

Three O
weeks O
later O
the O
Russians B-ORG
, O
who O
arrived O
here O
later O
, O
entrained O
us O
and O
took O
us O
to O
Sagan B-LOC
where O
we O
stayed O
in O
a O
tolerable O
camp B-TER
for O
seven O
weeks O
. O

The O
ill B-TER
were O
cured O
in O
hospital B-TER
. O

We O
returned O
home O
via O
Nachod B-LOC
with O
a O
Czech B-TER
transport O
. O

My O
plans O
for O
the O
future O
: O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Palestine B-LOC
