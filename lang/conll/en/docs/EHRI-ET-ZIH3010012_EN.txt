We O
were O
in O
Wilno B-LOC
when O
the O
Russo- O
German B-TER
war B-TER
broke O
out O
. O

Right O
after O
the O
Germans B-TER
entered O
, O
because O
it O
was O
July O
12 O
, O
[ O
19]41 O
, O
I O
mysteriously O
lost O
my O
husband O
. O

He O
went O
out O
for O
a O
few O
cigarettes O
and O
he O
never O
returned O
. O

As O
I O
found O
out O
[ O
later O
] O
, O
he O
was O
caught O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
kidnapped B-TER
in O
a O
car O
. O

That O
same O
day O
, O
three O
thousand O
Jews O
were O
taken O
that O
way O
. O

I O
was O
left O
with O
my O
15 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
him O
and O
guarded O
him O
like O
my O
own O
life O
, O
and O
we O
managed O
to O
survive O
the O
many O
purges O
, O
and O
that O
was O
no O
mean O
feat O
, O
for O
when O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
existed O
for O
three O
months O
, O
only O
12,000 O
Jews O
were O
left O
of O
a O
total O
of O
75,000 O
. O

Fearing O
that O
the O
time O
would O
come O
for O
those O
who O
remain O
as O
well O
, O
we O
escaped B-TER
to O
Białystok B-LOC
. O

That O
is O
where O
the O
slaughter B-TER
began O
on O
February O
5 O
, O
[ O
19]43 O
. O

The O
first O
time O
, O
twelve O
thousand O
people O
were O
deported B-TER
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
, O
and O
1100 O
were O
killed B-TER
on O
the O
spot O
. O

After O
a O
pause O
of O
a O
half O
- O
year O
, O
the O
total O
liquidation O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
began O
. O

That O
was O
August O
16 O
, O
1943 O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
with O
my O
siblings O
in O
an O
attic O
shelter B-TER
. O

At O
day O
break O
and O
evening O
[ O
? O
] O
, O
we O
crawled O
to O
the O
shelter B-TER
, O
cooking O
a O
meager O
meal B-TER
at O
night O
, O
our O
food B-TER
consisted O
of O
some O
groats O
and O
a O
few O
biscuits B-TER
without O
any O
fat O
at O
all O
. O

My B-TER
brother I-TER
and I-TER
his I-TER
wife I-TER
got O
out O
after O
4 O
weeks O
, O
we O
did O
n’t O
have O
anywhere O
to O
go O
to O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
were O
worse O
and O
worse O
, O
the O
water O
was O
turned O
off O
, O
we O
could O
n’t O
cook O
and O
to O
make O
matters O
worse O
, O
we O
often O
witnessed O
the O
discovery O
of O
shelters B-TER
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

The O
people O
who O
were O
discovered O
were O
killed B-TER
mercilessly O
, O
even O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
abused O
: O
Diese O
elenden O
hunde O
( O
German O
) O
– O
These O
pathetic O
dogs O
. O

and O
homeric O
laughter O
was O
their O
final O
farewell O
. O

We O
suffered O
like O
that O
for O
nine O
weeks O
. O

We O
felt O
that O
we O
would O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
out O
anymore O
. O

My O
son B-TER
decided O
to O
risk O
going O
out O
, O
since O
we O
were O
near O
the O
end O
anyway O
. O

One O
evening O
, O
he O
dug O
a O
hole O
under O
the O
exit O
gate O
and O
made O
it O
out O
successfully O
. O

He O
went O
to O
relatives B-TER
that O
were O
set O
up O
with O
some O
Poles B-TER
and O
my O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
managed O
to O
find O
a O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
there O
after O
just O
fourteen O
days O
, O
however O
, O
because O
the O
child B-TER
told O
the O
neighbors O
about O
us O
. O

Wandering O
the O
streets O
, O
we O
approached O
a O
passerby O
, O
who O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
merciful O
person O
, O
took O
us O
under O
his O
wing O
and O
found O
us O
a O
good O
shelter B-TER
. O

We O
took O
it O
easy O
for O
three O
months O
. O

During O
that O
time O
, O
several O
Belarusians B-TER
were O
appointed O
to O
our O
apartment O
, O
and O
we O
were O
once O
again O
without O
a O
roof O
over O
our O
heads O
. O

My O
son B-TER
went O
to O
Mr. O
Czuliński B-PER
again O
, O
which O
is O
what O
our O
benefactor O
was O
called O
, O
and O
he O
promised O
to O
find O
us O
such O
a O
place O
again O
. O

And O
after O
a O
few O
days O
, O
he O
really O
did O
tell O
us O
that O
his O
former O
maid O
proposed O
a O
place O
with O
her O
. O

He O
and O
my O
son B-TER
went O
to O
agree O
on O
the O
conditions O
, O
and O
they O
never O
came O
back O
home O
. O

As O
we O
learned O
later O
, O
she O
was O
a O
cook O
for O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
was O
in O
their O
service O
. O

They O
were O
taken O
in O
handcuffs O
on O
January O
27 O
, O
1944 O
, O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
from O
there O
to O
prison B-TER
. O

Czuliński B-PER
was O
sent O
to O
a O
camp B-TER
, O
to O
Gdańsk B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
sent O
word O
that O
it O
had O
been O
the O
maid O
who O
delivered O
them O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
executioners B-TER
. O

My O
poor O
child B-TER
stayed O
in O
the O
death B-TER
cell I-TER
suffering O
and O
hungry B-TER
until O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
to O
Zielona B-LOC
, I-LOC
where O
the O
martyrs O
were O
killed B-TER
during O
that O
period O
. O

My O
relatives B-TER
took O
me O
under O
their O
care O
and O
convinced O
their O
protectors O
to O
keep O
and O
protect O
me O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
there O
when O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
arrived O
and O
liberated B-TER
us O
. O

It O
is O
only O
now O
that O
I O
feel O
the O
full O
brunt O
of O
my O
misfortune O
, O
all O
the O
delusions O
and O
hopes O
have O
burst O
. O

No O
one O
will O
return O
to O
us O
our O
dear O
ones O
who O
are O
dead B-TER
now O
, O
who O
were O
killed B-TER
in O
such O
a O
brutal O
fashion O
. O
