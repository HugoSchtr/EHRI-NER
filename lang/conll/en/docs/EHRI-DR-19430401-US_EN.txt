I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
present O
below O
some O
informative O
material O
on O
the O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC
including O
an O
article O
from O
the O
Bulgarian B-TER
newspaper B-TER
DNES B-ORG
of O
March O
22 O
, O
1943 O
, O
and O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
a O
Jewish B-TER
graduate O
of O
the O
American B-ORG
College I-ORG
of O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

[ O

The O
most O
cursory O
reading O
of O
the O
article O
shows O
that O
it O
was O
written O
for O
the O
purpose B-TER
of I-TER
stirring I-TER
up I-TER
feeling I-TER
against O
Jews B-TER
as O
a O
class O
. O

The O
most O
definite O
charge O
is O
that O
of O
hoarding O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
Jews B-TER
were O
long O
ago O
placed O
under O
the O
most O
rigid O
restrictions B-TER
with O
regard O
to O
food B-TER
. O

Further O
, O
they O
have O
been O
so O
thoroughly O
robbed B-TER
of I-TER
all I-TER
their I-TER
possessions I-TER
, O
including O
all O
bank B-TER
accounts I-TER
, O
that O
few O
of O
them O
have O
any O
considerable O
wealth B-TER
now O
at O
their O
disposal O
. O

The O
general O
terms O
employed O
by O
the O
writer B-TER
would O
indicate O
that O
he O
is O
not O
writing O
on O
a O
factual O
basis O
but O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
an O
effect O
, O
that O
is O
, O
suspicion O
and O
hatred O
toward O
the O
Jew B-TER
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
inflammatory B-TER
article I-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
which O
has O
appeared O
in O
any O
newspaper B-TER
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

All O
evidence O
coming O
our O
[ O
sic O
] O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
indicates O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-TER
people B-TER
generally O
disapprove O
of O
the O
harsh O
measures B-TER
being O
taken O
by O
the O
Government B-TER
against O
Jews B-TER
and O
do O
what O
they O
can O
to O
alleviate O
their O
condition O
. O

The O
recent O
protests B-TER
by O
many O
leading O
citizens O
and O
by O
more O
than O
forty O
members B-TER
of I-TER
Parliament I-TER
are O
sufficient O
evidence O
of O
the O
attitude B-TER
of O
Bulgarians B-TER
toward O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measures I-TER
inaugurated O
by O
the O
Filov B-PER
Government B-TER
