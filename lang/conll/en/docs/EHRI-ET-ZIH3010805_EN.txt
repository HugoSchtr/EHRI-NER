In O
September O

taken O
to O
a O
ghetto B-TER
: O
In O
the O

they O
smashed O

apartment B-TER
and O
frequently O
beat B-TER

On O

1942 O
they O
made O
a O

an O
action O

in O
which O
they O
took O
my O
father O
; O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
to O
the O

I O
found O
a O

At O
about O

a O

a O
little B-TER

where O
I O
was O
hidden B-TER
with O

Presently O
the O
child B-TER
began O
to O
cry O
; O
Schupo O
men O
in O
the O
text O
: O
„ O

soon O
heard O
him O
and O

In O

well O
as O
20 O
other O
people B-TER
who I-TER
were I-TER
hiding I-TER

he O
answered O
: O

) O
( O

Me O
in O

house O
and O
my O
sisters O
under O

remained O
in O

At O

we O
went O
down O
; O
our O

was O
gone O
, O
that O
is O
the O
Germans B-TER
had O
taken O
him O
. O

And O
we O
became O

. O

And O
so O
, O
as O
a O
poor O
prisoner B-TER
- O
a O
young B-TER
orphan I-TER
– O
I O
had O
to O
go O

In O

On O

. O

1943 O
the O
Germans B-TER
made O
Sokal B-LOC
Judenfrei O
I O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
Lager B-TER
and O
naprawiłem O
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
took O
direction O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
to O
Volhynia B-LOC
. O

And O
so O
I O
had O
to O
cross B-TER
the I-TER
border I-TER
: O
Volhynia B-LOC
– O
Galicia B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
crossing B-TER
the I-TER
border I-TER
near O
the O
village O
of O
Józefka B-LOC
: O
The O
night O
was O
dark O
; O
it O
was O
very O
dark O
; O
I O
was O
crossing B-TER
that I-TER
border I-TER
at O
11.30 O
p.m. O
and O
I O
ran O
into O
a O
German B-TER
ambush O
, O
which O
consisted O
of O
35 O
Germans B-TER
and O
Uzbeks B-TER
. O

They O
lighted O
the O
field O
with O
[ O
signal O
] O
rockets O
; O
I O
began O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
from O
the O
place O
. O

They O
surrounded O
me O
and O
began O
to B-TER
shoot I-TER
at O
me O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
pay O
attention O
to O
that O
shooting B-TER
( O
as O
I O
knew O
very O
well O
it O
was O
death O
all O
the O
same O
) O
so O
I O
began O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
even O
faster O
. O

I O
ran O
until O
two O
Germans B-TER
grabbed O
me O
by O
the O
hands O
and O
neck O
. O

Soon O
, O
more O
Germans B-TER
and O
Uzbeks B-TER
izmienniki O
Rod’iny O
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
traitors O
of O
the O
state O
– O
text O
written O
in O
Cyrillic O
alphabet O
came O
running O
and O
they O
dragged O
me O
to O
Józefka B-LOC
to O
the O
station O
– O
the O
border O
one O
, O
where O
they O
stripped B-TER
me I-TER
naked I-TER
and I-TER
beat I-TER
me I-TER
terribly I-TER
and O
wrote B-TER
a I-TER
report I-TER
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
answer O
the O
questions O
so O
they O
beat B-TER
me I-TER
all I-TER
the I-TER
harder I-TER
till O
5 O
a.m. O
Then O
the O
commanding O
officer O
of O
the O
zastawa O
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
a O
border O
station O
came O
and O
said O
I O
should O
be O
hanged B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
talked O
between O
themselves O
and O
I B-TER
was I-TER
sentenced I-TER
to I-TER
be I-TER
shot I-TER
. O

At O
5.30 O
I O
was O
led O
out O
under O
the O
escort O
of O
2 O
Germans B-TER
and O
2 O
Uzbeks B-TER
and O
the O
commanding O
officer O
himself O
, O
and O
they O
drove O
me O
to O
the O
forest O
to O
shoot B-TER
me O
. O

In O
the O
forest B-TER
they O
surrounded O
me O
; O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
shovel O
, O
and O
the O
commanding O
officer O
outlined O
a O
pit B-TER
for O
my O
size O
and O
told O
me O
to O
dig O
. O

So O
I O
turned O
to O
the O
Uzbeks B-TER
and O
said O
Shto O
ya O
vam O
sdelal O
? O
Za O
shto O
vy O
budete O
mne O
molodogo O
strelyat O
’ O
? O
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
What O
have O
I O
done O
to O
you O
? O
Why O
are O
you O
going O
to O
shoot O
me O
, O
a O
youngster O
? O
– O
text O
written O
in O
Cyrillic O
alphabet O
And O
they O
answer O
Ladno O
, O
kopay O
. O

( O
Rus O
. O

) O
– O
OK O
. O

, O
dig O
! O
– O
text O
written O
in O
Cyrillic O
alphabet O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
my O
revenge O
before O
death B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
told O
me O
to O
take O
off O
my O
jacket B-TER
. O

I O
stood O
the O
shovel O
in O
front O
of O
the O
commanding O
officer O
, O
took O
off O
my O
jacket B-TER
and O
handed O
it O
to O
a O
German B-TER
. O

I O
took O
the O
shovel O
into O
my O
hands O
, O
sprang B-TER
up I-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
commanding I-TER
officer I-TER
and O
chopped O
his O
head O
open O
. O

That O
moment O
the O
fryc B-TER
( O
Rus O
. O

) O
- O
a O
pejorative O
term O
for O
a O
German O
came O
down O
to O
the O
ground O
; O
I O
jumped O
over O
him O
, O
sprang B-TER
2 O
- O
3 O
m O
away O
, O
got O
caught O
on O
a O
bush O
and O
fell O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
heard O
shots O
; O
I O
jumped O
to O
my O
feet O
and O
wanted O
to O
run O
further O
so O
that O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
n’t O
catch O
me O
alive O
and O
cut O
me O
up O
, O
but O
only O
shoot O
me O
during O
the O
flight O
( O
from O
behind O
) O
. O

I O
broke O
20 O
to O
30 O
meters O
away O
from O
them O
and O
saw O
I O
was O
still O
alive O
and O
would O
be O
able O
to O
run O
away O
perhaps O
. O

So O
I O
began O
to O
run O
faster O
. O

I O
flew O
like O
a O
bird O
between O
the O
bushes O
. O

I O
had O
run O
some O
2 O
km O
, O
so O
I O
stopped O
to O
find O
out O
where O
I O
was O
. O

Where O
should O
I O
run O
? O
I O
crawled O
under O
a O
bush O
, O
covered B-TER
myself O
with O
moss O
so O
that O
nobody O
would O
notice O
me O
. O

I O
lay B-TER
there O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
; O
suddenly O
, O
I O
hear O
a O
clatter O
of O
a O
wagon O
; O
I O
look O
and O
see O
a O
farmer O
driving O
one O
horse B-TER
; O
he O
’s O
driving O
very O
slowly O
and O
looking O
all O
around O
him O
. O

I O
sneaked O
out O
of O
those O
bushes B-TER
, O
went O
up O
to O
the O
road O
and O
asked O
him O
very O
quietly O
: O
Which O
way O
should O
I O
go O
to O
Gruszów B-LOC
, O
mister O
? O
The O
farmer O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
me O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
him O
: O
And O
what O
are O
those O
houses O
near O
here O
? O
The O
farmer O
answered O
: O
It O
’s O
the O
border O
station O
in O
Szarpańce O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
the O
where O
is O
that O
border O
? O
So O
the O
farmer O
turned O
around O
and O
showed O
me O
a O
plate O
with O
the O
inscription O
Grenze O
, O
( O
Ger O
. O

) O
– O
border O
that O
was O
stuck O
to O
a O
thick O
oak O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
Oh O
God O
, O
I O
’ve O
run O
more O
than O
2 O
km O
and O
I O
’m O
still O
on O
that O
damned O
border O
; O
I O
’ve O
almost O
run O
into O
another O
damned O
Nazi O
station O
. O

I O
also O
asked O
the O
farmer O
to O
give O
me O
something O
to O
cover O
myself O
with O
, O
as O
I O
was O
naked O
. O

But O
the O
farmer O
would O
n’t O
give O
me O
anything O
. O

He O
only O
said O
: O
run O
away O
quick O
because O
some O
Germans B-TER
are O
coming O
near O
here O
. O

I O
ran O
across O
that O
forest O
, O
ran O
out O
into O
the O
fields O
and O
reached O
Gruszów B-LOC
. O

I O
went O
to O
several O
cabins O
there O
. O

I O
pretended O
to O
be O
a O
Ukrainian B-TER
running O
away O
from O
a O
German B-TER
Lager I-TER
. O

I O
asked O
several O
farmers O
to O
give O
me O
something O
to O
put O
on O
, O
but O
nobody O
took O
pity B-TER
on O
me O
. O

I O
asked O
if O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
[ O
there O
] O
or O
the O
police O
. O

So O
they O
told O
me O
nobody O
came O
there O
except O
for O
Banderites O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
was O
samostyjna O
Ukraina O
! O
( O
Ukr O
. O

) O
– O
independant O
Ukraine O
So O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
: O
I O
’ve O
run O
away O
from O
one O
hell O
but O
got O
into O
another O
. O

I O
left O
the O
village O
, O
went O
into O
the O
fields B-TER
. O

I O
saw O
a O
scarecrow O
in O
the O
hemp B-TER
; O
I O
took O
that O
scarecrow O
; O
took O
off O
its O
torn O
jacket B-TER
, O
cap O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
thin O
wire O
; O
I O
went O
into O
the O
rye O
, O
dusted O
that O
uniform B-TER
, O
sewed O
it O
up O
with O
the O
wire O
( O
as O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
a O
needle O
) O
and O
the O
uniform B-TER
was O
ready O
. O

When O
I O
put O
that O
uniform B-TER
on O
, O
I O
felt O
much O
better O
- O
better O
than O
in O
good O
clothes B-TER
when O
I O
left O
the O
Lager B-TER
. O

I O
pulled O
the O
cap B-TER
over O
my O
head O
; O
I O
let O
the O
visor O
down O
on O
my O
eyes O
; O
the O
bottom O
got O
torn O
and O
my O
hair O
hung O
on O
the O
cap B-TER
. O

Dressed O
in O
that O
uniform B-TER
, O
I O
went O
to O
look O
for O
employment O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kuczków O
in O
Poryck B-LOC
district O
. O

I O
was O
in O
Kuczków O
as O
a O
servant O
for O
3 O
months O
. O

After O
the O
3 O
months O
I O
joined O
Soviet B-TER
partisans I-TER
of O
Kowpak O
’s O
Otryad O
( O
Rus O

. O

General O
Semyon O
Kovpak O
was O
a O
famous O
Soviet O
partisan O
commander O
, O
active O
in O
Ukraine O
. O

I O
was O
uniformed B-TER
and O
armed O
right O
away O
. O

I O
went O
with O
the O
partisans B-TER
to O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Lwów B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
way O
we O
fought O
with O
Banderites O
, O
policemen B-TER
and O
Germans B-TER
. O

While O
crossing O
the O
Galicia B-LOC
- O
Volhynia B-LOC
border O
the O

Near O
Rawa B-LOC
Ruska I-LOC

villages O
and O
a O

station O
, O
and O
to O
chase O
the O

. O

After O

I O

But O

decent O
man O
at O
the O
time O
, O
as O
he O
fought O
