Before O
I O
go O
in O
detail O
into O
the O
events O
of O
10th O
November O
1938 O
, O
I O
would O
like O
briefly O
to O
list O
the O
reasons O
which O
led O
to O
the O
ruin O
of O
our O
business B-TER
. O

Customers O
started O
the O
boycott B-TER
immediately O
after O
the O
seizure O
of O
power O
, O
it O
intensified O
continuously O
, O
not O
so O
much O
voluntarily O
as O
through O
coercive O
means O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
state O
and O
the O
Party B-TER

. O

However O
, O
since O
this O
did O
not O
lead O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
fast O
enough O
for O
the O
Party B-TER
, O
a O
boycott B-TER
by O
suppliers O
was O
later O
instigated O
. O

First O
the O
Reichsnahrstand O
Reich O
Food O
Corporation O
blocked O
the O
delivery O
of O
flour B-TER
and O
semolina B-TER
, O
then O
consignments O
of O
foreign O
goods O
were O
also O
blocked O
( O
oil B-TER
, O
citrus B-TER
fruit I-TER
, O
later O
partly O
cocoa B-TER
, O
chocolate B-TER
, O
rice B-TER
) O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
1937 O
the O
National O
Salt O
Mines O
in O
Munich B-LOC
informed O
us O
that O
they O
would O
no O
longer O
supply O
salt B-TER
; O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
1938 O
the O
South B-ORG

, O
with O
whom O
we O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
business B-TER
for O
decades O
, O
made O
the O
same O
announcement O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
manufacturers O
of O
branded O
goods O
partly O
started O
to O
block O
deliveries O
, O
first O
Oetker B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Bielefeld I-ORG
. O

Early O
on O
a O
number O
of O
customers O
cited O
the O
Party B-TER
in O
cases O
of O
non O
- O
payment O
. O

Since O
all O
our O
demands O
were O
justified O
, O
we O
mostly O
took O
no O
notice O
of O
that O
, O
although O
we O
sometimes O
received O
directly O
threatening O
letters B-TER
from O
the O
Party B-TER
telling O
us O
not O
to O
take O
any O
action O
against O
debtors O
. O

Initially O
, O
contact O
with O
the O
authorities B-TER
was O
still O
polite O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1937 O
, O
the O
district O
office O
in O
Weißenburg B-LOC
refused O
to O
issue O
travel O
permits O
, O
which O
was O
actually O
nine O
months O
before O
the O
corresponding O
Reich O
law O
was O
passed O
. O

This O
made O
any O
travel O
impossible O
, O
which O
would O
inevitably O
lead O
to O
the O
demise O
of O
most O
wholesale O
businesses B-TER
. O

In O
1938 O
, O
the O
Finanzamt O
tax O
office O
belatedly O
collected O
the O
sum O
of O
RM B-TER
. O

35,000.- O
for O
turnover O
tax B-TER
, O
since O
allegedly O
the O
conditions O
for O
a O
reduction O
based O
on O
wholesale O
did O
not O
apply O
, O
even O
though O
there O
was O
a O
written O
permit O
from O
the O
Finanzamt O
. O

During O
a O
meeting O
at O
the O
Finanzamt O
to O
apply O
for O
a O
refund O
the O
clerk O
said O
that O
if O
an O
appeal O
was O
lodged O
the O
regional O
tax B-TER
office I-TER
would O
carry O
out O
a O
further O
audit O
of O
turnover O
tax B-TER
for O
the O
period O
up O
to O
1935 O
. O

This O
was O
indeed O
scheduled O
for O
November O
1938 O
and O
was O
only O
not O
carried O
out O
because O
of O
the O
events O
in O
November O
. O

In O
... O
the O
situation O
was O
such O
that O
for O
years O
it O
had O
been O
almost O
impossible O
to O
let O
children B-TER
out O
on O
the O
streets O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Adults O
were O
also O
not O
safe O
from O
being O
accosted O
by O
school B-TER
children B-TER
; O
until O
the O
start O
of O
1938 O
complaints O
to O
the O
constabulary O
resulted O
in O
some O
peace O
, O
later O
even O
complaints O
were O
pointless O
. O

Window O
smashing O
was O
in O
part O
prevented O
by O
the O
glass O
insurance B-TER
companies I-TER
. O

Any O
purchases O
made O
in O
Jewish B-TER
shops I-TER
and O
talking O
to O
or O
greeting O
of O
a O
Jew O
by O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
were O
immediately O
reported O
to O
the O
mayor O
who O
called O
the O
culprits O
in O
. O

They O
were O
excluded O
from O
city O
deliveries O
, O
support O
etc O
. O

In O
May O
1938 O
, O
hairdressers O
agreed O
en O
bloc O
not B-TER
to I-TER
serve I-TER
Jews O
any O
more O
. O

Individual O
craftsmen O
had O
already O
done O
this O
earlier O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
autumn O
1938 O
during O
the O
Czech B-LOC
war O
crisis O
animosities O
visibly O
increased O
. O

Being O
jostled O
by O
people B-TER
large O
and O
small O
, O
stone B-TER
throwing I-TER
, O
window O
smashing O
, O
removal O
of O
shutters O
during O
the O
day O
were O
not O
uncommon O
. O

The O
unrest O
and O
nervousness O
increased O
even O
further O
when O
it O
was O
learnt O
from O
various O
Jewish B-TER
Gemeinden I-TER
communities O
( O
Leutershausen B-LOC
, O
Ellingen B-LOC
etc O
. O

) O
that O
Jews O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
leave O
their O
houses B-TER
on O
the O
high B-TER
holidays I-TER
, O
leaving O
their O
goods O
and O
chattels O
wherever O
they O
were O
, O
and O
sell O
the O
synagogues B-TER
at O
ludicrously O
low O
prices O
( O
in O
some O
cases O
for O
a O
few O
marks B-TER
) O
. O

I O
want O
to O
add O
that O
my O
17 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
daughter B-TER
witnessed O
a O
mob B-TER
attack I-TER
during O
the O
Juniaktion O
June O
operation O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
girls I-TER
boarding I-TER
school I-TER
was O
attacked B-TER
; O
a O
telephone O
call O
to O
the O
Berlin B-LOC
Überfallkommando O
flying O
squad O
prompted O
the O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
non- O
Aryans B-TER
were O
involved O
, O
in O
which O
case O
it O
would O
not O
be O
a O
matter O
for O
the O
Überfallkommando O
. O

On O
10th O
November O
1938 O
between O
4 O
and O
5 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
heard O
steps O
in O
the O
garden O
. O

When O
I O
looked O
out O
of O
the O
window O
eight O
to O
ten O
men B-TER
( O
SA B-ORG
) O
were O
standing O
, O
heavily O
armed O
with O
axes O
, O
hatchets O
, O
daggers O
and O
revolvers O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
woke O
my O
wife B-TER
and O
my O
11 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
son B-TER
a O
man B-TER
was O
already O
in O
the O
bedroom B-TER
who O
ordered O
us O
to O
go O
to O
the O
basement B-TER
and O
immediately O
started O
to O
smash B-TER
everything O
to O
pieces O
: O
the O
washing O
jug O
and O
bowl O
, O
mirrors O
, O
windows O
, O
furniture O
, O
doors O
etc O
. O

After O
we O
( O
which O
included O
my O
sister B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
and O
daughter B-TER
) O
had O
been O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
for O
a O
short O
time O
I O
was O
called O
up O
. O

When O
my O
daughter B-TER
wanted O
to O
come O
with O
me O
she O
was O
pushed O
back O
. O

Somebody O
yelled O
at O
me O
: O
Du O
Lumpyou O
wretch O
, O
you O
know O
that O
since O
12 O
o'clock O
midnight O
you O
have O
been O
declared O
fair O
game O
for O
us O
, O
give O
us O
your O
documents O
. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
had O
unlocked O
the O
desk O
I O
had O
received O
such O
a O
blow O
to O
the O
face O
that O
my O
glasses O
fell O
off O
and O
broke O
, O
my O
right O
eye O
swelled B-TER
up I-TER
heavily O
and O
my O
pupil B-TER
was I-TER
paralysed I-TER
. O

The O
doctor B-TER
explained O
later O
that O
I O
could O
have O
lost O
my O
sight O
from O
this O
blow O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
shoved O
into O
a O
corner O
and O
indiscriminately O
pelted O
with O
items O
of O
furniture O
. O

That O
I O
only O
sustained O
three O
flesh O
wounds O
and O
no O
serious O
injury O
has O
to O
be O
described O
as O
extremely O
lucky O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
entire O
house B-TER
was O
wrecked O
in O
the O
way O
described O
above O
. O

In O
the O
kitchen B-TER
every O
last O
piece O
of O
crockery O
was O
smashed B-TER
; O
in O
the O
basement B-TER
my O
wife B-TER
was O
hit O
on O
the O
head O
with O
a O
full O
tin O
of O
food O
; O
the O
women B-TER
had O
to O
smash B-TER
wine O
bottles O
and O
preserving O
jars O
themselves O
. O

The O
mob O
came O
after O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
then O
the O
school B-TER
children B-TER
; O
each O
party O
destroyed O
and O
stole O
yet O
more O
. O

It O
can O
be O
stated O
without O
any O
doubt O
that O
the O
SA B-ORG
took O
away O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
writing O
desk O
: O
a O
gentleman O
’s O
gold B-TER
wristwatch I-TER
, O
a O
new O
gentleman O
’s O
wristwatch B-TER
, O
RM B-TER
. O

120.- O
in O
cash B-TER
, O
a O
wedding B-TER
ring I-TER
, O
a O
necklace B-TER
. O

A O
lady O
's O
gold B-TER
wristwatch I-TER
and O
a O
girl O
’s O
ring B-TER
were O
also O
stolen O
on O
the O
same O
Thursday O
. O

It O
should O
be O
added O
that O
a O
part O
of O
the O
large O
tiled O
stoves O
and O
the O
grand O
piano B-TER
were O
also O
destroyed O
. O

By O
the O
time O
my O
wife B-TER
got O
round O
to O
packing O
a O
few O
days O
later O
, O
all O
the O
wardrobes O
and O
drawers O
were O
almost O
completely O
empty O
, O
so O
that O
almost O
all O
the O
clothes B-TER
and O
most O
of O
the O
underwear B-TER
had O
been O
stolen O
. O

All O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
in O
were O
treated O
in O
this O
or O
a O
similar O
way O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
synagogue B-TER
with O
all O
the O
Thorarollen O
Torah O
scrolls O
, O
all O
the O
prayer B-TER
books I-TER
, O
tefillin O
[ O
phylacteries O
] O
, O
tallits O
prayer O
shawls O
, O
the O
over-100 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Memorbuch O
memory O
book O
etc O
. O

were O
also O
set O
on O
fire O
and O
burnt B-TER
. O

The O
unusable O
Thorarollen O
, O
which O
had O
been O
stored O
in O
the O
outbuilding O
, O
were O
not O
burnt B-TER
. O

The O
city O
did O
not O
pay O
anything O
for O
the O
large O
plot O
where O
the O
synagogue B-TER
, O
the O
bath B-TER
house I-TER
, O
the O
teacher B-TER
's I-TER
home I-TER
had O
stood O
, O
nor O
for O
the O
outbuilding O
and O
the O
garden O
, O
since O
the O
cost O
for O
clearing O
up O
equalled O
its O
value O
. O

The O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
was O
also O
repeatedly O
desecrated O
before O
and O
after O
the O
10th O
November O
. O

On O
the O
10th O
November O
, O
after O
the O
various O
destruction B-TER
operations O
, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
pack O
some O
underwear B-TER
and O
clothes B-TER
and O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
railway B-TER
station I-TER
through O
rows O
of O
the O
rabble O
and O
accompanied O
by O
their O
jeers O
. O

Other O
members O
of O
the O
Gemeinde B-TER
were O
already O
there O
, O
others O
already O
left O
on O
earlier O
trains B-TER
. O

Some O
who O
remained O
were O
badly O
mistreated O
the O
same O
evening O
; O
partly O
by O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
in O
the O
Rathaus O
town O
hall O
the O
over O
70 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
doctor B-TER
... O
in O
particular O
, O
who O
was O
so O
upset O
by O
it O
that O
he O
took B-TER
his I-TER
own I-TER
life I-TER
. O

The O
remaining O
Jews O
had O
to O
leave O
town O
the O
following O
day O
, O
which O
brought O
the O
century O
- O
old O
Jewish O
Gemeinde O
to O
an O
end O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Munich B-LOC
, O
where O
I O
met O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
travelled O
a O
few O
hours O
earlier O
. O

After O
a O
short O
stay O
my O
brother O
and O
I O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

After O
various O
personal O
details O
had O
been O
taken O
down O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
various O
personal O
details O
were O
recorded O
again O
, O
we O
were O
photographed O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
hours O
until O
we O
got O
to O
the O
bath B-TER
house I-TER
. O

There O
we O
were O
brought O
before O
the O
doctor B-TER
after O
the O
bath B-TER
and O
had O
to O
announce O
: O
Schutzhaftjudeprotective O
custody O
Jew O
X. O
respectfully O
reporting O
. O

Because O
we O
had O
not O
announced O
ourselves O
loud O
enough O
, O
with O
most O
of O
the O
other O
prisoners B-TER
I O
was O
slapped O
round O
the O
face O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Stabsarzt O
medical O
officer O
. O

Examinations O
were O
not O
carried O
out O
; O
we O
were O
simply O
asked O
: O
Ill O
or O
had O
an O
accident O
? O
However O
, O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
the O
old O
, O
cripples O
, O
diabetics B-TER
and O
the O
mentally B-TER
subnormal I-TER
all O
remained O
in O
custody B-TER
; O
in O
our O
barrack B-TER
e.g. O
an O
elderly O
gentleman O
who O
had O
polio B-TER
, O
could O
hardly O
walk O
and O
speak O
and O
was O
incontinent B-TER
. O

After O
the O
examination O
we O
came O
out O
into O
the O
open O
from O
the O
warm O
bath B-TER
house I-TER
dressed B-TER
only O
in O
short O
shirts B-TER
, O
socks B-TER
, O
trousers B-TER
and O
cotton O
drill O
jacket B-TER
. O

We O
all O
had O
to O
stand O
until O
midnight O
whether O
we O
had O
been O
imprisoned B-TER
early O
that O
morning O
, O
like O
individual O
gentlemen O
from O
Munich B-LOC
, O
or O
later O
. O

SS B-TER
men I-TER
watched O
us O
and O
if O
anybody O
was O
seen O
not O
standing O
to O
attention O
properly O
there O
were O
slaps O
around O
the O
face O
and O
shoves O
. O

After O
12 O
o'clock O
we O
were O
led O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

There O
we O
received O
the O
only O
food B-TER
of O
the O
day O
, O
tea B-TER
and O
Kommissbrot O
army O
bread O
. O

The O
barracks B-TER
themselves O
were O
split O
into O
four O
dormitories O
; O
each O
dormitory O
consisted O
of O
two O
rooms B-TER
, O
intended O
for O
50 O
men B-TER
. O

However O
, O
they O
were O
occupied O
by O
200 O
. O

The O
washroom B-TER
and O
toilet B-TER
were O
accordingly O
insufficient O
. O

Initially O
four O
men B-TER
had O
to O
make O
do O
with O
one O
towel O
, O
which O
was O
also O
used O
for O
drying O
the O
crockery O
. O

Later O
towels O
and O
underpants O
could O
be O
bought O
in O
the O
canteen O
. O

The O
daily O
routine O
was O
roughly O
as O
follows O
: O
wake O
- O
up O
at O
5 O
o'clock O
, O
wash B-TER
, O
coffee B-TER
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
eat B-TER
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
there O
were O
blocks O
where O
almost O
always O
one O
had O
to O
eat B-TER
and I-TER
drink I-TER
outside O
, O
i.e. O
standing O
. O

This O
depended O
on O
the O
Stubenältester O
room O
elders O
, O
who O
, O
of O
course O
, O
were O
never O
taken O
to O
task O
by O
the O
SS B-ORG
in O
charge O
for O
bad O
treatment O
of O
the O
Jews O
. O

Since O
the O
rooms B-TER
had O
to O
be O
cleaned O
before O
the O
Appell O
roll O
call O
, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
leave O
them O
at O
half O
past O
5 O
. O

We O
then O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
some O
time O
on O
the O
camp B-TER
road O
before O
we O
were O
led O
to O
the O
Appellplatz O
parade O
ground O
. O

After O
the O
Appell O
, O
the O
Zimmerdienst O
room O
cleaning O
group O
xx O
( O
which O
included O
me O
most O
of O
the O
time O
) O
was O
allowed O
to O
stand O
down O
, O
whereas O
most O
people B-TER
had O
to O
march O
and O
do O
Exerzieren O
punitive O
drills O
in O
all O
weathers O
until O
after O
11 O
o'clock O
. O

Initially O
Jewish O
former O
officers B-TER
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
in O
charge O
, O
later O
only O
Aryans B-TER
. O

After O
lunch B-TER
, O
we O
usually O
had O
30 O
- O
60 O
minutes O
’ O
free O
time O
, O
then O
it O
was O
Appell O
again O
, O
marching O
and O
Exerzieren O
again O
and O
after O
a O
short O
break O
, O
evening O
Appell O
. O

After O
the O
evening O
meal B-TER
we O
were O
free O
until O
bed O
time O
( O
8 O
o'clock O
) O
. O

On O
the O
Appellplatz O
as O
in O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
and O
even O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

One O
was O
[ O
never O
] O
safe O
from O
SS B-ORG
checks O
. O

These O
almost O
never O
passed O
without O
beatings B-TER
and O
shoving O
. O

On O
one O
occasion O
I O
was O
helping O
a O
sick B-TER
person O
along O
when O
an O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
came O
and O
ordered O
me O
to O
let O
him O
walk O
by O
himself O
and O
gave O
me O
a O
push O
from O
behind O
for O
no O
other O
reason O
. O

Similarly O
I O
had O
a O
broom O
thrown O
at O
my O
head O
when O
I O
did O
not O
carry O
out O
an O
order O
fast O
enough O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
but O
, O
luckily O
, O
without O
being O
hit O
. O

Everybody O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Appell O
, O
whether O
sick B-TER
or O
old O
. O

So O
it O
happened O
that O
the O
sick B-TER
and O
weak O
often O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
by O
2 O
- O
4 O
men B-TER
. O

People O
who O
reported O
to O
the O
Revier O
sick O
bay O
or O
the O
doctor B-TER
were O
often O
sent O
away O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
before O
they O
were O
seen O
; O
then O
they O
were O
often O
discharged O
without O
any O
or O
insufficient O
examination O
and O
without O
decent O
treatment B-TER
. O

Special O
events O
On O
one O
occasion O
all O
the O
Jewish O
blocks O
( O
c. O
10,000 O
men B-TER
) O
had O
to O
stand O
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
from O
lunchtime O
till O
6 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

Standing O
still O
for O
30 O
- O
60 O
minutes O
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
was O
not O
uncommon O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
evening O
Appell O
we O
were O
often O
bullied O
by O
having O
to O
stand O
still O
for O
longer O
than O
usual O
instead O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
move O
. O

An O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
asked O
an O
acquaintance O
( O
aged O
over O
70 O
) O
his O
name O
. O

When O
he O
gave O
it O
without O
the O
prerequisite O
addition O
Schutzhaftjude O
he O
was O
twice O
slapped O
round O
the O
face O
so O
hard O
that O
he O
fell O
over O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
the O
man B-TER
was O
released B-TER
and O
died B-TER
two O
days O
[ O
after O
] O
his O
release B-TER
, O
another O
man O
2 O
hours O
after O
his O
return O
to O
Munich B-LOC
. O

An O
approximately O
60 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
man B-TER
with O
a O
bladder O
complaint O
asked O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
relieve O
himself O
. O

When O
this O
was O
refused O
and O
he O
replied O
something O
, O
he O
was O
hit O
so O
hard O
that O
he O
fell O
over O
. O

His O
comrades O
were O
forbidden O
to O
help O
him O
up O
. O

In O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
SS B-ORG
he O
was O
so O
badly O
beaten B-TER
by O
the O
Stubenälteste O
( O
an O
Aryan B-TER
prisoner B-TER
) O
that O
he O
was O
dead B-TER
when O
he O
was O
carried O
off O
the O
square O
. O

One O
evening O
a O
Munich B-LOC
Sanitätsrat O
medical O
consultant O
reported O
to O
the O
doctor B-TER
with O
appendix B-TER
pains O
. O

He O
was O
refused O
treatment B-TER
and O
had O
to O
return O
to O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

The O
following O
morning O
the O
Sanitätsrat O
called O
for O
help O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
a O
colleague O
had O
to O
confirm O
that O
he O
was O
dead B-TER
. O

It O
could O
not O
be O
ascertained O
whether O
a O
ruptured O
appendix B-TER
or O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
had O
been O
the O
cause O
. O

One O
gentleman O
died B-TER
of O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
on O
the O
Appellplatz O
. O

He O
was O
simply O
left O
there O
and O
it O
took O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
before O
the O
Sanitätspersonal O
medical O
orderlies O
came O
to O
pick O
him O
up O
with O
the O
words O
Another O
one O
's O
croaked O
. O

On O
release B-TER
day O
after O
having O
coffee B-TER
we O
had O
to O
stand O
from O
5 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
until O
the O
train B-TER
left O
Dachau B-LOC
at O
4 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
without O
any O
other O
food B-TER
. O

According O
to O
Aryan B-TER
prisoners B-TER
, O
the O
whole O
Juden O
- O
AktionJews O
operation O
of O
November O
1938 O
, O
as O
the O
matter O
was O
called O
in O
the O
files O
, O
had O
no O
connection O
with O
the O
vom B-PER
Rath I-PER
affair O
, O
since O
preparations O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
had O
been O
completed O
considerably O
earlier O
. O

Even O
whilst O
I O
was O
still O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
, O
my O
wife B-TER
was O
threatened O
that O
I O
would O
not O
be O
released B-TER
from O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
until O
my O
siblings O
abroad O
had O
their O
mortgages O
on O
my O
property B-TER
cancelled O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
although O
I O
was O
released B-TER
earlier O
I O
had O
to O
sell O
my O
house B-TER
for O
RM B-TER
. O

14,000- O
which O
had O
a O
value O
of O
at O
least O
RM B-TER
. O

23,000.- O
taking O
all O
the O
warehouses O
into O
account O
. O

A O
further O
RM B-TER
. O

2,500.- O
was O
deducted O
from O
that O
for O
damages O
caused O
by O
the O
SA B-ORG
on O
10th O
November O
during O
their O
wild O
frenzy O
of O
destruction O
. O

In O
the O
above O

I O
have O

almost O
without O

left O
out O
