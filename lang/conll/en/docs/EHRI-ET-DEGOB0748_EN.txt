border O
at O
Kőrösmező B-LOC
, O
we O
could O
not O
turn O
back O
as O
they O
would O
have O
killed B-TER
us O
but O
could O
continue O
in O
the O

In O

The O

we O
got O
into O
a O
forest O
where O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
Hungarian B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
were O
shooting O
at O
us O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
saw O
how O
they O
shot B-TER
my O
mother B-TER
and O
my O
brothers B-TER
and O
sisters B-TER
. O

I O
managed O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
and O
walked O
fast O
till O
Volóc B-LOC
, O
this O
is O
how O
I O
got O
back O
to O
Hungary B-TER
. O

Not O
much O
later O
, O
I O
came O
to O
my O
firm O
in O
Pest B-LOC
but O
was O
summoned O
already O
at O
the O
end O
of O
1943 O
( O
41 O
) O
to O
do O
labour B-TER
service I-TER
in O
Jászberény B-LOC
where O
I O
passed O
five O
months O
before O
I O
was O
transferred O
into O
a O
company O
in O
Pest B-LOC
. O

From O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1942 O
till O
the O
end O
of O
December O
1944 O
, O
I O
was O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
in O
an O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
air I-TER
raid I-TER
company I-TER
, O
then O
I O
was O
put O
into O
an O
unfamiliar O
company O
. O

Having O
entrained O
75 O
of O
us O
in O
a O
car O
at O
Józsefváros B-LOC
railway O
station O
they O
carried O
to O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
journey O
sitting O
people B-TER
kept O
swapping O
with O
standing O
ones O
as O
space O
was O
so O
little O
that O
we O
could O
not O
sit O
down O
all O
. O

We O
were O
escorted O
by O
gendarmes B-TER
till O
the O
Hungarian B-TER
border O
where O
they O
gave O
us O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

In O
the O
car O
someone O
committed O
suicide B-TER
, O
and O
two O
weak O
people B-TER
were O
trodden O
to O
death B-TER
. O

At O
the O
Austrian B-TER
border O
they O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
we O
got O
bread B-TER
and O
zulag B-TER
. O

There O
were O
3,500 O
people B-TER
in O
our O
transport B-TER
and O
the O
journey O
lasted O
ten O
days O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
a O
collecting O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
they O
disinfected O
us O
, O
seized O
what O
they O
could O
and O
dressed O
us O
in O
striped O
clothes B-TER
and O
wooden O
shoes O
. O

In O
Oranienburg B-LOC
we O
were O
grouped O
according O
to O
professions O
, O
this O
is O
how O
I O
got O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
- I-LOC
Siemensstadt I-LOC
, O
next O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
. O

Here O
they O
selected B-TER
the O
strong O
and O
the O
weak O
. O

I O
was O
put O
into O
an O
outlying O
kommando B-TER
, O
we O
carried O
iron O
railway O
lines O
, O
railway O
sleepers O
, O
which O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
job O
. O

For O
this O
work B-TER
we O
had O
the O
worst O
possible O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
. O

There O
was O
an O
SS B-TER
foreman O
who O
got O
there O
because O
of O
punishment O
. O

He O
was O
the O
one O
who O
distributed O
the O
food B-TER
giving O
us O
only O
three O
quarters O
of O
a O
litre O
of O
soup B-TER
instead O
of O
a O
litre O
, O
and O
stole O
also O
from O
the O
bread B-TER
portions O
, O
so O
we O
became O
really O
weak O
, O
many O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
, O
and O
often O
we O
ate O
also O
potato B-TER
peels I-TER
. O

These O
foremen O
and O
block O
leaders O
beat O
us O
with O
batons O
but O
we O
also O
suffered O
a O
lot O
of O
cold O
. O

One O
day O
I O
put O
a O
blanket O
under O
my O
clothes B-TER
but O
was O
noticed O
by O
the O
foreman O
who O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

They O
gripped O
my O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
gave O
me O
100 O
blows O
, O
another O
time O
I O
got O
a O
slap O
so O
strong O
that O
the O
eardrum O
broke O
. O

A O
great O
number O
of O
people B-TER
died B-TER
because O
of O
cold O
, O
of O
maltreatment O
and O
of O
starvation B-TER
, O
especially O
young O
boys O
. O

They O
often O
bombed B-TER
the O
Siemens B-ORG
company O
, O
at O
the O
end O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
burnt O
down O
so O
they O
took O
me O
back O
to O
Sachsenhausen B-LOC
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
8 O
days O
when O
we O
got O
an O
order O
to O
set O
off O
as O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
already O
pretty O
close O
. O

We O
had O
to O
queue O
up O
immediately O
and O
leave O
but O
as O
we O
were O
the O
last O
transport B-TER
there O
was O
no O
food B-TER
left O
for O
us O
. O

We O
started O
our O
march B-TER
on O
foot O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Hamburg B-LOC
, O
towards O
the O
sea O
, O
40 O
kilometres O
a O
day O
. O

We O
were O
starving B-TER
so O
much O
that O
on O
the O
way O
we O
attacked O
locust O
trees O
and O
finished O
all O
their O
leafs B-TER
but O
we O
were O
not O
particularly O
choosy O
, O
we O
ate O
also O
grass B-TER
. O

Once O
we O
noticed O
a O
potato B-TER
clamp O
and O
started O
to O
run O
to O
it O
but O
the O
SS B-TER
shot O
at O
us O
and O
I O
got O
a O
bullet O
in O
the O
head O
. O

Those O
who O
were O
left O
behind O
on O
the O
road O
were O
covered O
with O
a O
blanket O
. O

This O
is O
how O
I O
passed O
half O
a O
day O
, O
then O
I O
got O
out O
and O
ran B-TER
across O
the O
woods O
towards O
Schwerin B-LOC
. O

17 O
kilometres O
further O
I B-TER
met I-TER
the O
first O
American B-TER
soldier B-TER
. O

They O
put O
a O
bandage O
on O
my O
head O
and O
took O
me O
into O
a O
sanatorium B-TER
. O

This O
happened O
the O
2nd O
of O
May O
. O

Thereafter O
I O
had O
a O
good O
life O
, O
I O
got O
everything O
I O
wanted O
, O
and O
was O
carefully O
treated O
for O
a O
month O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Lübeck B-LOC
, O
and O
applied O
for O
one O
of O
the O
Czech B-TER
transports O
. O

I O
came O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
via O
Prague B-LOC
and O
Pozsony B-LOC
. O

My O
future O
plans O
: O
At O
the O
moment O
I O
work O
here O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
later O
I O
would O
like O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
Palestine B-TER
. O
