The O
jurisdiction B-TER
of O
the O
court B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Self I-ORG
- I-ORG
administration I-ORG
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
was O
derived O
from O
the O
authorisation O
of O
the O
command O
of O
the O
security O
forces O
[ O
SS B-TER
] O
there O
. O

It O
had O
jurisdiction B-TER
over O
custody O
, O
probate O
and O
criminal B-ORG
matters I-ORG
. O

In O
matters O
of O
probate O
, O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
court B-TER
were O
limited O
to O
the O
confiscation O
of O
clothing O
and O
pieces O
of O
laundry O
, O
as O
the O
Jewish O
settlement O
could O
n’t O
acquire O
the O
items O
required O
by O
the O
destitute O
inhabitants B-TER
in O
any O
other O
way O
; O
any O
real O
administration O
of O
estates O
was O
completely O
absent O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
assets O
. O

The O
responsibility O
of O
the O
court B-ORG
in I-ORG
criminal I-ORG
matters I-ORG
was O
usually O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
a O
district O
court B-TER
. O

In O
special O
cases O
and O
through O
a O
special O
authorisation O
from O
the O
[ O
SS B-TER
] O
command O
, O
the O
jurisdiction B-TER
could O
be O
extended O
and O
eventually O
included O
full O
sentencing O
competency O
in O
matters O
of O
crimes O
and O
offences O
, O
whose O
sentencing O
– O
as O
with O
any O
transgression O
– O
was O
trusted O
to O
a O
single O
judge O
. O

As O
the O
legal O
basis O
for O
the O
jurisdiction B-TER
of O
the O
court B-TER
ended O
with O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
[ O
SS B-ORG
] O
command O
, O
the O
activities O
of O
the O
court B-TER
were O
largely O
discontinued O
and O
only O
continued O
when O
it O
involved O
the O
determination O
of O
criminal O
offences O
in O
preliminary O
proceedings O
. O

A O
special O
custodial O
jurisdiction B-TER
for O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
is O
, O
in O
consideration O
of O
the O
likely O
short O
- O
lived O
existence O
of O
the O
settlement O
, O
completely O
superfluous O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
a O
probate O
court B-TER
, O
as O
the O
only O
decision O
that O
could O
be O
made O
by O
the O
court B-TER
was O
that O
, O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
assets O
, O
no O
probate O
proceedings O
will O
take O
place O
. O

However O
, O
what O
is O
essential O
is O
the O
maintenance O
a O
criminal O
justice O
system O
. O

Criminality O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
had O
its O
own O
characteristics O
; O
aside O
from O
a O
small O
number O
of O
cases O
such O
as O
insulting O
a O
public O
servant O
or O
minor O
assault O
( O
§ O
411 O
) O
, O
nearly O
all O
of O
the O
property O
- O
related O
offences O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
scarcity O
of O
food B-TER
, O
were O
either O
theft O
from O
the O
communal O
storehouses O
, O
or O
fraud O
at O
the O
food B-TER
distribution O
points O
. O

These O
offences O
were O
alarming O
due O
to O
their O
frequency O
and O
the O
punishment O
was O
disproportionately O
higher O
than O
the O
sentence O
would O
have O
been O
outside O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
similar O
offences O
. O

These O
offences O
continue O
and O
seem O
unlikely O
to O
stop O
. O

The O
district O
court B-TER
responsible O
will O
hardly O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
deal O
with O
sentencing O
these O
cases O
that O
deal O
with O
what O
are O
– O
in O
normal O
circumstances O
– O
small O
things O
. O

They O
can O
however O
not O
go O
unpunished O
. O

The O
makeup O
of O
the O
population B-TER
shifted O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
last O
transports B-TER
carried O
out O
by O
the O
German O
authorities O
, O
which O
also O
led O
a O
to O
significant O
worsening O
of O
the O
situation O
in O
terms O
of O
criminality O
. O

Transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
, O
bringing O
political O
rather O
career O
criminals O
with O
them O
. O

Is O
has O
also O
been O
difficult O
to O
make O
other O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
prisoners B-TER
become O
accustomed O
to O
conforming O
to O
the O
calm O
and O
regulations O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
crimes O
that O
have O
gone O
unpunished O
due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
a O
law O
enforcement O
system O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
such O
cases O
will O
have O
to O
dealt O
with O
by O
the O
ordinary O
courts B-TER
. O

These O
courts B-TER
will O
, O
however O
, O
hardly O
be O
in O
a O
position O
to O
make O
the O
required O
institutions O
available O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
preliminary O
proceedings O
. O

In O
this O
instance O
, O
the O
continued O
activity O
of O
the O
Jewish O
court B-TER
would O
be O
expedient O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
exercising O
of O
police O
penal O
power O
is O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
now O
it O
has O
been O
exercised O
by O
a O
judge O
. O

In O
summary O
, O
a O
special O
jurisdiction B-TER
for O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
for O
violations O
, O
as O
well O
as O
in O
matter O
of O
police O
powers O
is O
essential O
. O

The O
possibility O
must O
also O
be O
available O
, O
that O
crimes O
and O
offences O
can O
be O
determined O
. O

As O
long O
as O
these O
activities O
can O
not O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
usual O
bodies O
and O
institutions O
, O
the O
continued O
existence O
of O
the O
Theresienstadt B-TER
Court I-TER
is O
to O
be O
recommended O
