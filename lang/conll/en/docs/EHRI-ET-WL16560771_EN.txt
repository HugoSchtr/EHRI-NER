The O

They O

But O
soon O
these O

The O
experiences O
of O
a O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish O
woman B-TER
in O
1944 O
. O

The O
19 O
th O
of O
March O
1944 O
was O
a O
black O
day O
in O
the O
history O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

On O
this O
day O
, O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
occupied B-TER
the O
country O
and O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
section O
under O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
infamous O
Commissioner O
Eichmann B-PER
, O
set O
up O
their O
quarters O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
a O
tragedy O
began O
which O
ended O
with O
the O
destruction B-TER
of O
a O
major O
part O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewry O
and O
the O
devastation O
of O
my O
beautiful O
country O
. O

A O
lot O
has O
been O
written O
and O
reported O
about O
the O
historical O
events O
of O
this O
woeful O
time O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
I O
want O
to O
give O
an O
account O
about O
my O
experiences O
as O
a O
woman B-TER
, O
and O
with O
it O
, O
give O
an O
excerpt O
from O
the O
life O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish O
women B-TER
in O
the O
fateful O
year O
of O
1944 O
. O

The O
day O
mentioned O
was O
a O
Sunday O
. O

We O
woke O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
as O
usual O
, O
a O
little O
later O
than O
on O
week O
days O
. O

Nothing O
indicated O
that O
this O
day O
would O
have O
any O
special O
importance O
. O

Even O
the O
newspapers B-TER
presented O
nothing O
special O
– O
the O
usual O
news O
and O
reports O
from O
the O
war B-TER
zones I-TER
– O
which O
we O
were O
used O
to O
. O

But O
about O
11 O
o’clock O
our O
neighbour O
knocked O
on O
the O
door O
, O
and O
asked O
with O
a O
face O
bathed O
in O
shock O
, O
if O
we O
had O
heard O
anything O
. O

It O
was O
said O
in O
the O
city O
that O
the O
German B-LOC
military B-TER
had O
marched O
in O
and O
that O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government B-TER
had O
abdicated O
. O

We O
had O
no O
idea O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
had O
marched O
in O
and O
through O
Hungary B-LOC
happened O
several O
times O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
war B-TER
years O
, O
and O
did O
not O
appear O
as O
remarkable O
because O
Hungary B-LOC
was O
one O
of O
the O
belligerent O
countries O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich B-TER
and O
Italy B-LOC
. O

Important O
connections O
to O
Romania B-LOC
, O
to O
Russia B-LOC
and O
to O
the O
Balkans B-LOC
led O
through O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

But O
up O
until O
now O
, O
they O
had O
not O
interfered O
in O
the O
inner O
affairs O
. O

What O
pro B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
and O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measures I-TER
that O
had O
occurred O
so O
far O
were O
the O
result O
of O
diplomatic B-TER
pressure O
from O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
not O
military B-TER
intervention B-TER
. O

It O
had O
been O
painful O
and O
had O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
worry O
and O
sadness O
to O
many O
Jewish O
families B-TER
, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
had O
not O
been O
affected O
up O
till O
now O
. O

The O
fundamentals O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewry O
, O
even O
if O
a O
bit O
shaken O
in O
their O
economic B-TER
positions O
, O
were O
still O
intact O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
and O
looking O
at O
the O
rough O
outlines O
, O
you O
could O
say O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
now O
stood O
about O
where O
that O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
Jewry O
stood O
around O
the O
years O
1936 O
and O
1937 O
, O
with O
one O
big O
difference O
, O
that O
in O
view O
of O
the O
events O
in O
the O
war B-TER
zones I-TER
, O
the O
twilight O
of O
the O
Nazis O
tin O
Gods O
was O
already O
evident O
, O
and O
with O
It O
, O
now O
in O
the O
early O
spring O
of O
1944 O
, O
the O
optimism O
of O
the O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
had O
a O
semblance O
of O
justification O
. O

However O
, O
now O
lightning O
struck O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
it O
became O
obvious O
that O
a O
catastrophe O
of O
huge O
proportions O
was O
unfolding O
, O
or O
was O
at O
least O
in O
its O
early O
stages O
, O
to O
be O
more O
accurate O
. O

Large O
numbers O
of O
Germans B-LOC
in O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
and O
SS B-ORG
uniforms B-TER
appeared O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

German B-LOC
cars O
sped O
through O
the O
city O
. O

A O
big O
hotel B-TER
, O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
city O
, O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
staff O
and O
German B-LOC
sentries O
stood O
there O
on O
guard O
. O

The O
editorial O
buildings O
of O
the O
left O
leaning O
newspapers B-TER
were O
occupied O
and O
a O
team O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
appeared O
in O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
Community I-ORG
of O
Budapest B-LOC
. O

Like O
an O
awful O
nightmare O
, O
terror O
settled O
over O
the O
entire O
country O
. O

For O
women B-TER
like O
us O
, O
it O
was O
especially O
bad O
and O
we O
hardly O
dared O
to O
go O
out O
onto O
the O
streets O
in O
order O
to O
make O
even O
the O
most O
essential O
purchases O
. O

Of O
the O
edicts B-TER
and O
measures B-TER
, O
which O
in O
the O
next O
days O
and O
weeks O
like O
a O
torrent O
rained O
down O
over O
the O
Jews O
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O
and O
the O
most O
obvious O
to O
the O
eye O
was O
the O
order B-TER
to O
wear O
the O
star B-TER
of I-TER
David I-TER
. O

It O
came O
into O
force O
on O
the O
4th O
of O
April O
. O

It O
was O
exactly O
prescribed O
, O
which O
shape O
the O
star B-TER
must O
have O
, O
which O
material O
and O
in O
which O
colour O
it O
was O
to O
be O
made O
, O
and O
where O
it O
must O
be O
worn O
. O

We O
women B-TER
acquired O
the O
task O
of O
making O
the O
star B-TER
for O
the O
whole O
family B-TER
out O
of O
yellow O
material O
. O

Soon O
no O
suitable O
yellow O
material O
could O
be O
found O
in O
the O
entire O
city O
. O

Later O
the O
stars B-TER
were O
mass O
produced O
. O

It O
was O
a O
dangerous O
thing O
to O
deviate O
the O
star B-TER
even O
in O
the O
smallest O
way O
from O
the O
prescribed O
form O
because O
anyone O
who O
did O
not O
wear O
it O
exactly O
according O
to O
the O
regulations B-TER
was O
immediately O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
criminal B-TER
officials B-TER
who O
prowled O
the O
streets O
at O
the O
behest O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

Besides O
the O
legal O
measures B-TER
, O
a O
whole O
host O
of O
lone O
actions O
occurred O
which O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
in O
their O
hatred O
of O
the O
Jews O
did O
in O
their O
free O
time O
for O
their O
private O
pleasure O
. O

Scavenging O
in O
the O
individual O
apartments B-TER
of O
houses B-TER
rented O
by O
Jews O
, O
in O
order O
to O
confiscate O
there O
valuable O
radios B-TER
, O
cameras O
or O
jewellery O
, O
became O
a O
favourite O
sport O
. O

The O
leaders O
and O
interpreters O
for O
these O
actions O
were O
mainly O
the O
numerous O
ethnic O
Germans B-LOC
elements O
settled O
in O
Hungary B-TER
who O
now O
naturally O
felt O
in O
their O
element O
and O
who O
constituted O
the O
liaison O
officers O
between O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
authorities O
. O

They O
found O
out O
from O
the O
caretakers O
of O
the O
individual O
houses B-TER
the O
names O
of O
the O
Jewish O
tenants O
and O
then O
went O
together O
with O
the O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
from O
apartment B-TER
to O
apartment B-TER
. O

A O
group O
of O
four O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
also O
appeared O
at O
our O
door O
in O
the O
early O
days O
of O
April O
. O

They O
forced O
their O
way O
into O
our O
flat B-TER
and O
searched O
the O
room O
for O
radios B-TER
because O
, O
as O
they O
said O
, O
every O
Jew O
listens O
to O
enemy O
radio O
broadcasts O
. O

We O
showed O
them O
and O
old O
model B-TER
, O
and O
because O
my O
husband O
explained O
to O
them O
in O
fluent O
German B-LOC
that O
it O
was O
actually O
not O
possible O
with O
this O
old O
box O
to O
be O
able O
to O
receive O
foreign O
stations B-TER
, O
they O
were O
a O
little O
confused O
and O
finally O
withdrew O
although O
not O
without O
having O
uttered O
ugly O
threats O
. O

They O
then O
went O
through O
the O
remaining O
Jewish O
apartments B-TER
in O
the O
block O
and O
their O
activities O
were O
finally O
stopped O
when O
a O
highly O
ranked O
Hungarian B-LOC
officer B-TER
appeared O
in O
the O
picture O
whom O
a O
Christian B-TER
neighbour O
had O
speedily O
sent O
for O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-LOC
officer B-TER
appeared O
indignant O
about O
the O
individual O
actions O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
though O
, O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
too O
predisposed O
to O
be O
taken O
the O
Jews O
under O
his O
protection O
. O

However O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
his O
uniform B-TER
was O
sufficient O
to O
cause O
the O
Germans B-LOC
to O
leave O
the O
house B-TER
. O

In O
the O
adjoining O
house B-TER
where O
they O
went O
after O
, O
they O
had O
more O
luck O
and O
left O
heavily O
laden O
with O
booty O
. O

A O
similar O
group O
of O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
appeared O
a O
few O
days O
later O
at O
my O
parent O
’s O
apartment B-TER
a O
few O
streets O
away O
from O
us O
. O

Also O
there O
they O
were O
looking O
for O
spoils O
. O

They O
took O
some O
valuable O
objects O
with O
them O
. O

However O
, O
what O
was O
worse O
than O
this O
was O
that O
my O
mother O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
threats O
and O
aggressive O
appearance O
of O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
suffered O
a O
heart B-TER
attack I-TER
and O
was O
bed O
- O
ridden O
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

These O
days O
were O
full O
of O
worries B-TER
and O
cares O
. O

We O
continually O
heard O
that O
people B-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
and O
interned O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jews O
from O
all O
of O
the O
provincial O
cities O
had O
been O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
and O
deported B-TER
. O

I O
had O
many O
relatives B-TER
in O
the O
provinces O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
taken O
away O
to O
German B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
and O
only O
a O
few O
of O
them O
returned O
later O
. O

The O
majority O
fell O
victims B-TER
to O
the O
Nazi O
terror O
. O

In O
May O
, O
my O
husband O
was O
conscripted O
for O
work B-TER
service O
. O

That O
was O
a O
hard O
blow O
for O
us O
all O
. O

We O
knew O
from O
the O
experience O
of O
earlier O
years O
that O
the O
treatment O
and O
provisions O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
work B-TER
service I-TER
had O
always O
been O
bad O
, O
and O
this O
time O
it O
was O
expected O
to O
be O
even O
worse O
. O

And O
equally O
, O
the O
worst O
was O
expected O
for O
those O
defenceless O
family B-TER
members O
left O
behind O
. O

The O
news O
had O
already O
come O
from O
the O
provinces O
that O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
in O
full O
flow O
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
be O
only O
a O
question O
of O
time O
before O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
in O
Budapest B-LOC
would O
come O
. O

Meanwhile O
a O
torrent O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
orders I-TER
and I-TER
decrees I-TER
hailed O
down O
upon O
us O
: O
the O
blocking O
of O
bank B-TER
balances I-TER
; O
the O
confiscation B-TER
of O
radios B-TER
and O
objects O
of O
value O
; O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
food B-TER
rations I-TER
; O
a O
travel B-TER
ban I-TER
and O
so O
on O
. O

Every O
week O
brought O
a O
new O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
measure I-TER
. O

It O
appeared O
to O
be O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
plan O
of O
the O
authorities B-TER
, O
that O
exactly O
now O
that O
they O
had O
robbed O
Jewish O
families B-TER
of O
their O
men O
through O
conscription B-TER
for I-TER
work I-TER
duty I-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
, O
old O
people B-TER
and O
children B-TER
could O
be O
exposed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
it O
firstly O
to O
the O
terror O
of O
the O
orders B-TER
of O
the O
authorities B-TER
and O
later O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
deportation B-TER
without O
any O
defence B-TER
. O

Through O
the O
splitting O
apart O
of O
the O
family B-TER
members O
, O
the O
problems O
of O
existence O
became O
almost O
unsolvable O
. O

You O
could O
no O
longer O
think O
about O
any O
regulated O
acquisition O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

You O
had O
to O
sell O
everything O
that O
was O
superfluous O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
compete O
for O
the O
extremely O
restricted B-TER
means O
of O
subsistence O
. O

Those O
amongst O
our O
co O
- O
religionists O
who O
were O
completely O
penniless O
were O
dependent O
upon O
the O
support B-TER
of O
the O
community O
. O

Families B-TER
helped O
out O
one O
another O
. O

A O
long O
period O
of O
want O
and O
going O
without O
began O
, O
and O
it O
always O
got O
worse O
until O
it O
finally O
increased O
to O
unbearable O
hunger O
pangs O
. O

So O
long O
as O
my O
husband O
in O
the O
first O
weeks O
of O
work B-TER
conscription O
was O
stationed O
in O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
near O
the O
capital O
city O
, O
he O
was O
able O
occasionally O
with O
a O
fake O
, O
leave O
chit O
or O
because O
of O
a O
simulated O
illness B-TER
to O
come O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
be O
helpful O
to O
us O
with O
the O
forced O
rehousing B-TER
from O
our O
apartment B-TER
and O
into O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
in O
the O
following O
June O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
time O
, O
these O
occasions O
became O
more O
difficult O
and O
more O
infrequent O
and O
we O
had O
to O
look O
for O
other O
ways O
and O
means O
, O
to O
keep O
in O
contact O
. O

You O
could O
not O
rely O
on O
the O
post O
. O

There O
were O
though O
in O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
and O
later O
in O
more O
distant O
garrisons O
some O
farm O
labourers B-TER
who O
were O
ready O
for O
money O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
flattery O
to O
deliver O
letters B-TER
, O
small O
packages O
, O
news O
and O
so O
on O
. O

It O
became O
a O
regular O
and O
organised O
shuttle O
service O
. O

These O
half O
grown O
lads O
, O
who O
went O
several O
times O
a O
week O
, O
from O
Goedoelloe B-LOC
to O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
back O
in O
order O
to O
convey O
mail B-TER
and O
messages O
from O
a O
company O
of O
those O
in O
work B-TER
service I-TER
to O
their O
wives O
and O
parents O
in O
the O
house B-TER
for O
Jews O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
and O
the O
same O
back O
, O
gradually O
became O
a O
veritable O
plague O
. O

As O
they O
became O
conscious O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
their O
role O
on O
the O
one O
side O
and O
the O
helplessness O
of O
the O
Jews O
on O
the O
other O
, O
their O
insolence O
and O
greediness O
grew O
. O

They O
demanded O
ever O
bigger O
sums O
of O
money B-TER
for O
their O
message O
service O
, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
blackmailed O
in O
shameless O
ways O
and O
even O
indulged O
themselves O
physical O
effronteries O
against O
the O
defenceless O
Jewish O
women B-TER
to O
whom O
they O
delivered O
the O
messages O
. O

Every O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
in O
a O
house O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
kept O
in O
contact O
with O
their O
husband O
in O
this O
way O
complained O
about O
it O
and O
it O
became O
from O
day O
to O
day O
and O
from O
week O
to O
week O
more O
apparent O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
completely O
and O
without O
legal O
recourse O
, O
exposed O
to O
such O
attacks B-TER
and O
extortions B-TER
. O

The O
days O
of O
the O
forced O
resettlement O
from O
the O
existing O
apartments B-TER
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Jewish O
houses O
( O
middle O
of O
June O
) O
brought O
the O
hardest O
tasks O
. O

The O
most O
common O
furnishings O
and O
household B-TER
effects O
had O
to O
be O
in O
any O
case O
left O
behind O
. O

However O
, O
even O
the O
transportation B-TER
of O
the O
most O
indispensable O
items O
hit O
huge O
difficulties O
because O
inside O
a O
few O
days O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
people B-TER
had O
to O
resettle O
. O

So O
it O
was O
as O
good O
as O
impossible O
to O
find O
vehicles O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
you O
had O
to O
carry O
the O
possessions O
and O
parcels O
yourself O
. O

Anyone O
who O
was O
able O
to O
find O
a O
hand O
- O
cart O
, O
a O
pram O
or O
something O
similar O
could O
consider O
themselves O
lucky O
. O

You O
saw O
on O
the O
streets O
from O
early O
morning O
till O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
women B-TER
, O
old O
people B-TER
and O
children B-TER
struggling O
along O
heavily O
laden O
in O
the O
sweltering O
summer O
heat O
. O

In O
the O
new O
accommodation B-TER
, O
which O
were O
all O
overfilled O
with O
people B-TER
, O
right O
from O
the O
first O
day O
there O
was O
irritation O
with O
the O
other O
tenants O
, O
with O
the O
caretakers O
and O
with O
the O
neighbours O
. O

We O
believed O
we O
had O
arrived O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
hell O
when O
we O
experienced O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
which O
several O
families B-TER
had O
to O
share O
an O
apartment B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
all O
of O
this O
became O
steadily O
worse O
and O
worse O
. O

In O
these O
days O
on O
average O
we O
were O
six O
people B-TER
to O
a O
room B-TER
, O
and O
later O
this O
went O
so O
far O
that O
there O
were O
up O
to O
twenty O
people B-TER
residing O
in O
a O
space O
. O

The O
unlucky O
people B-TER
who O
came O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
last O
of O
all O
, O
were O
so O
cramped O
together O
that O
they O
could O
not O
even O
sleep O
stretched O
out O
, O
but O
had O
to O
survive O
the O
time O
of O
the O
siege B-TER
and O
the O
street O
battles B-TER
of O
Budapest B-LOC
sitting O
on O
chairs O
or O
squatting O
against O
the O
wall O
. O

Another O
evil O
, O
which O
brought O
the O
women B-TER
to O
despair O
, O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
leave O
the O
houses O
for O
the O
Jews O
between O
11 O
o’clock O
on O
the O
morning O
and O
5 O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

( O
Later O
this O
time O
span O
was O
even O
shortened O
) O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
daily O
purchasing O
of O
the O
most O
necessary O
provisions O
became O
a O
recurring O
agony O
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, O
the O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
for O
the O
general O
population B-TER
was O
becoming O
ever O
worse O
the O
nearer O
the O
front O
came O
. O

The O
food B-TER
which O
came O
to O
the O
market O
and O
the O
few O
businesses B-TER
which O
were O
still O
open O
was O
mostly O
sold O
out O
in O
the O
early O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
. O

When O
the O
Jews O
appeared O
at O
the O
market O
after O
11 O
o’clock O
, O
they O
had O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
was O
left O
. O

The O
doors O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
houses I-TER
were O
barely O
opened O
when O
the O
women B-TER
, O
armed O
with O
their O
shopping O
bags O
and O
nets O
, O
tumbled O
out O
and O
hurried O
along O
the O
streets O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ferret O
out O
something O
edible B-TER
. O

The O
hunt O
went O
from O
one O
shop O
to O
the O
other O
, O
in O
some O
in O
which O
you O
had O
to O
stand O
perhaps O
for O
hours O
, O
or O
in O
others O
in O
which O
there O
was O
a O
regular O
scuffle O
about O
some O
stocks O
. O

Many O
shops O
closed O
at O
midday O
and O
then O
the O
chase O
continued O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
black B-TER
market I-TER
flourished O
and O
the O
shop O
keepers O
had O
some O
things O
hidden O
under O
the O
counter O
, O
but O
in O
any O
case O
, O
most O
of O
us O
were O
deeply O
miserable O
and O
could O
not O
afford O
the O
expensive O
additional O
charge O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
each O
new O
day O
brought O
new O
cares O
and O
new O
worries O
. O

I O
lived O
the O
house B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
together O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
other O
relatives O
. O

One O
day O
, O
it O
was O
probably O
in O
July O
or O
August O
, O
my O
father O
, O
who O
at O
that O
time O
was O
in O
his O
seventies O
, O
was O
helping O
me O
with O
the O
shopping O
in O
a O
grocery B-TER
store O
. O

There O
was O
a O
big O
crowd O
in O
the O
shop O
and O
suddenly O
a O
soda B-TER
water I-TER
bottle O
either O
burst O
or O
exploded O
. O

It O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
determine O
exactly O
which O
. O

The O
pieces O
injured B-TER
my O
father O
in O
the O
right O
hand O
and O
penetrated O
deep O
into O
the O
flesh O
. O

The O
blood O
was O
streaming O
out O
, O
and O
at O
first O
sight O
, O
the O
injury B-TER
appeared O
to O
be O
worse O
than O
happily O
it O
later O
transpired O
. O

Of O
course O
there O
was O
no O
doctor B-TER
anywhere O
or O
even O
a O
dressing B-TER
to O
get O
hold O
of O
. O

Several O
householders O
, O
who O
perhaps O
could O
have O
helped O
, O
refused O
any O
help B-TER
to O
the O
old O
man B-TER
with O
the O
yellow B-TER
star I-TER
. O

Even O
the O
shop O
- O
keeper O
himself O
did O
not O
want O
to O
create O
trouble O
and O
edged O
him O
out O
of O
the O
door O
. O

The O
nearest O
hospital B-TER
was O
at O
least O
a O
half O
an O
hour O
away O
. O

A O
journey O
by O
car O
was O
prohibited O
to O
all O
Jews O
, O
through O
a O
decree B-TER
which O
was O
enacted O
shortly O
before O
. O

No O
taxi O
or O
vehicle O
would O
take O
the O
injured B-TER
man B-TER
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
a O
cyclist O
, O
who O
came O
our O
way O
, O
took O
pity O
and O
invited O
my O
father O
onto O
a O
three O
- O
wheeler O
which O
was O
designed O
for O
transporting B-TER
wares O
. O

My O
injured O
father O
arrived O
in O
this O
way O
with O
a O
considerable O
loss B-TER
of I-TER
blood I-TER
at O
the O
hospital B-TER
where O
at O
last O
first B-TER
aid I-TER
was O
given O
. O

He O
carried O
his O
arm O
in O
a O
sling O
for O
a O
month O
. O

In O
the O
second O
half O
of O
August O
, O
one O
day O
the O
rumour O
spread O
like O
lightning O
, O
that O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
of O
Budapest B-LOC
was O
imminent O
. O

The O
tension O
was O
high O
. O

Actually O
, O
an O
action O
of O
this O
sort O
was O
planned O
and O
the O
city O
swarmed O
with O
German B-LOC
SS B-ORG
and O
Hungarian B-LOC
gendarmes B-TER
. O

The O
action O
was O
cancelled O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
, O
although O
we O
only O
learned O
the O
details O
much O
later O
. O

All O
the O
Jews O
of O
Budapest B-LOC
stood O
at O
this O
time O
ready O
with O
a O
little O
bundle O
to O
march O
to O
the O
station O
and O
get O
into O
the O
waggons B-TER
. O

The O
essentials O
were O
snatched O
up O
and O
knotted O
in O
the O
bundle O
– O
some O
change O
of O
clothing B-TER
, O
some O
food B-TER
, O
soap B-TER
and O
comb O
, O
the O
most O
important O
documents B-TER
and O
keepsakes O
, O
and O
everything O
was O
tucked O
away O
close O
at O
hand O
beside O
the O
couch O
. O

This O
bundle O
never O
left O
us O
for O
many O
weeks O
and O
months O
. O

It O
became O
a O
visible O
sign O
of O
our O
Jewish O
fate O
. O

Every O
single O
Jew O
in O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
had O
it O
constantly O
by O
them O
. O

Everyone O
was O
ready O
to O
go O
day O
and O
night O
. O

Each O
of O
us O
lived O
in O
the O
constant O
fear B-TER
of O
being O
hauled O
out O
of O
the O
hell O
of O
the O
houses B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
and O
into O
a O
more O
frightful O
inferno O
. O

To O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
exceptions O
, O
they O
proved O
their O
character O
even O
in O
that O
terrible O
period O
. O

This O
showed O
itself O
in O
the O
mutual O
helpfulness B-TER
, O
which O
the O
individual O
families B-TER
showed O
to O
each O
other O
and O
in O
the O
assistance O
given O
by O
the O
better O
placed O
to O
the O
poorer O
people B-TER
. O

To O
cite O
another O
significant O
example O
… O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
summer O
, O
the O
rumour O
was O
spread O
that O
those O
Jews O
who O
were O
prepared O
to O
be O
christened B-TER
would O
avoid O
the O
impending O
threat O
of O
deportation B-TER
. O

Although O
both O
the O
catholic B-TER
and O
protestant B-TER
clergy B-TER
were O
willing O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
christening B-TER
in O
a O
shortened O
procedure O
, O
only O
a O
relatively O
few O
Jews O
chose O
this O
supposed O
way O
out O
. O

Despite O
the O
immensity O
of O
the O
danger O
, O
for O
the O
predominant O
and O
large O
majority O
such O
ideas O
were O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
rumour O
transpired O
to O
be O
completely O
unfounded O
. O

In O
all O
of O
the O
measures O
and O
excesses O
which O
followed O
, O
no O
difference O
was O
made O
between O
religious B-TER
Jews O
and O
Jews B-TER
by I-TER
race I-TER
. O

After O
the O
15th O
of O
October O
1945 O
, O
that O
day O
which O
passed O
off O
tragically O
, O
on O
which O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Regent O
Horthy B-PER
undertook O
a O
failed O
attempt O
to O
leave O
the O
coalition O
of O
axis B-TER
powers O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
the O
terror O
against O
the O
Jews O
was O
yet O
more O
increased O
. O

The O
time O
allowed O
for O
leaving O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
shortened O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
go O
out O
much O
at O
all O
because O
you O
ran O
the O
danger O
to O
be O
seized B-TER
and O
kidnapped B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
by O
the O
hordes O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
party I-ORG
. O

In O
fear B-TER
and O
dread O
, O
we O
sat O
in O
our O
crowded O
accommodation B-TER
. O

Compassionate O
people B-TER
from O
non O
- O
Jewish O
neighbourhoods O
slipped O
us O
food B-TER
here O
and O
there O
at O
dusk O
. O

The O
postal O
system O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
stalled O
. O

We O
heard O
nothing O
from O
our O
husbands O
who O
were O
with O
work B-TER
details O
in O
the O
in O
the O
provinces O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
no O
began O
to O
hear O
something O
different O
– O
gun O
fire O
from O
the O
approaching O
front B-TER
. O

At O
first O
we O
heard O
it O
only O
at O
night O
, O
then O
also O
in O
the O
day O
; O
ever O
louder O
and O
louder O
; O
ever O
clearer O
and O
non O
- O
stop O
, O
until O
finally O
it O
became O
an O
unbroken O
backdrop O
to O
our O
lives O
in O
the O
following O
four O
months O
. O

The O
new O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
government B-TER
also O
passed O
amongst O
their O
numerous O
terror O
laws B-TER
in O
these O
days O
a O
decree B-TER
which O
proclaimed O
the O
conscription O
of O
all O
Jewish O
women B-TER
under O
45 O
for O
work B-TER
service I-TER
. O

After O
the O
men B-TER
, O
now O
it O
was O
also O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
Jewish O
women B-TER
. O

The O
women B-TER
from O
the O
area O
in O
which O
I O
lived O
, O
were O
supposed O
to O
present O
themselves O
on O
a O
certain O
day O
in O
Tattershall B-LOC
near O
the O
Eastern O
railway B-TER
station O
. O

Because O
the O
disorganisation O
in O
the O
country O
was O
already O
widely O
advanced O
and O
in O
all O
the O
areas O
of O
administration B-TER
a O
lot O
of O
panic O
, O
if O
not O
chaos O
, O
prevailed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
any O
mention O
of O
a O
gathering O
using O
lists O
or O
names O
. O

Therefore O
many O
Jewish O
women B-TER
, O
including O
myself O
, O
simply O
ignored O
this O
conscription B-TER
decree B-TER
. O

We O
were O
fully O
conscious O
that O
as O
a O
result O
we O
were O
venturing O
a O
very O
dangerous O
step O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
saw O
even O
greater O
danger O
in O
carrying O
out O
the O
conscription B-TER
order B-TER
. O

Once O
you O
were O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
members O
, O
you O
could O
be O
kidnapped B-TER
, O
deported B-TER
or O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
houses O
of O
the O
Jews O
was O
indeed O
a O
hell O
and O
a O
constant O
repository O
of O
insecurity O
, O
but O
under O
the O
present O
circumstances O
, O
it O
was O
still O
relatively O
more O
secure O
than O
the O
streets O
, O
or O
Tattershall B-LOC
or O
any O
other O
place O
in O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

The O
period O
that O
followed O
showed O
that O
this O
consideration O
was O
correct O
. O

Of O
the O
women B-TER
and O
young O
girls O
who O
went O
to O
Tattershall B-LOC
almost O
all O
were O
assigned O
to O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
on O
the O
defence O
line O
around O
Budapest B-LOC
or O
were O
deported B-TER
to O
German B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

Very O
few O
actually O
returned O
. O

On O
the O
27th O
of O
October O
, O
my O
husband O
arrived O
at O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
coming O
via O
secret O
paths O
. O

He O
had O
detached O
himself O
from O
the O
work B-TER
group O
, O
and O
similarly O
, O
had O
seen O
the O
houses O
for O
Jews O
as O
relatively O
the O
safest O
spot O
. O

However O
, O
we O
were O
both O
clear O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
as O
good O
as O
illegal O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
from O
these O
days O
until O
the O
middle O
of O
January O
when O
the O
Russians B-LOC
entered O
, O
we O
led O
the O
live O
of O
a O
hunted O
beast O
. O

We O
acquired O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
, O
amongst O
which O
was O
a O
certificate O
from O
a O
doctor B-TER
with O
famous O
name O
, O
attesting O
that O
my O
husband O
had O
a O
serious O
heart B-TER
problem O
. O

That O
helped O
us O
over O
the O
first O
raid O
. O

One O
such O
raid O
arrived O
at O
our O
house B-TER
on O
the O
first O
few O
days O
of O
November O
. O

Several O
men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
of O
work B-TER
service I-TER
age O
were O
randomly O
lead O
away O
and O
even O
some O
older O
people B-TER
were O
not O
spared O
. O

When O
an O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
man B-TER
entered O
our O
room B-TER
, O
I O
was O
able O
on O
the O
evidence O
of O
my O
old O
mother O
, O
my O
father O
with O
his O
arm O
in O
a O
sling O
and O
my O
husband O
lying O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
heart B-TER
condition I-TER
, O
to O
induce O
him O
to O
leave O
us O
in O
peace O
. O

However O
, O
our O
stay O
in O
this O
house B-TER
was O
at O
an O
end O
. O

We O
were O
clear O
about O
that O
. O

We O
acquired O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Schutzpässe O
/ O
protection O
passes O
which O
at O
this O
time O
were O
given O
out O
by O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
Consulate B-TER
based O
, O
albeit O
unintentionally O
, O
in O
a O
so O
- O
called O
shelter B-TER
in O
a O
neighbouring O
street O
. O

Where O
we O
had O
in O
total O
6 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
room B-TER
, O
now O
, O
in O
our O
new O
accommodation B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
share O
with O
12 O
people B-TER
to O
a O
room B-TER
. O

However O
, O
we O
could O
not O
even O
remain O
there O
long O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
November O
, O
we O
were O
hauled O
out O
in O
a O
new O
raid O
and O
our O
Schutzpässe O
declared O
invalid O
. O

We O
were O
led O
to O
a O
train B-TER
along O
with O
many O
others O
. O

We O
succeeded O
on O
the O
way O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

We O
wondered O
around O
for O
several O
days O
, O
and O
we O
spent O
the O
nights O
here O
and O
there O
with O
non O
- O
Jewish O
friends O
. O

Again O
we O
were O
apprehended B-TER
; O
and O
again O
we O
fled B-TER
; O
until O
finally O
we O
found O
shelter B-TER
in O
a O
clinic B-TER
where O
we O
had O
to O
conduct O
ourselves O
in O
devious O
ways O
: O
once O
we O
had O
to O
project O
ourselves O
as O
non O
- O
Jews O
and O
another O
time O
we O
had O
to O
simulate O
being O
ill B-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
had O
torn O
off O
and O
thrown O
away O
our O
yellow B-TER
stars I-TER
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
first O
escape B-TER
. O

It O
was O
not O
easy O
to O
wander O
round O
the O
streets O
with O
an O
unconcerned O
face O
and O
go O
passed O
many O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
members O
, O
who O
hung O
about O
and O
roamed O
around O
everywhere O
, O
and O
stopped O
people B-TER
who O
looked O
suspicious O
. O

In O
order O
to O
give O
myself O
courage O
and O
to O
appear O
as O
unconcerned O
as O
possible O
, O
I O
cultivated O
in O
such O
circumstances O
a O
cheerful O
tune O
, O
humming O
and O
going O
along O
the O
street O
with O
a O
smiling O
face O
, O
whilst O
in O
reality O
my O
heart O
was O
beating O
furiously O
with O
fear B-TER
. O

I O
had O
to O
muster O
a O
special O
courage O
and O
endurance O
when O
I O
was O
separated O
from O
my O
husband O
after O
our O
re B-TER
- I-TER
arrest I-TER
and O
was O
brought O
to O
a O
house B-TER
in O
Teleki O
Platz O
where O
nothing O
but O
Jewish O
women B-TER
were O
under O
heavy O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
guard O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
showed O
my O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
and O
claimed O
that O
I O
was O
a O
refugee B-TER
from O
the O
provinces O
who O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
by O
mistake O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
members O
knew O
that O
many O
false B-TER
papers I-TER
were O
in O
circulation O
and O
rejected O
me O
brusquely O
. O

However O
, O
I O
did O
not O
allow O
myself O
to O
be O
intimidated O
and O
demanded O
once O
again O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
police B-TER
officer O
. O

Rejected O
ten O
times O
, O
I O
did O
not O
move O
away O
from O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
room B-TER
where O
the O
police B-TER
were O
who O
it O
was O
known O
were O
not O
as O
fanatical O
as O
the O
Arrow B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

After O
waiting O
for O
hours O
– O
hungry B-TER
, O
cold O
and O
completely O
exhausted O
– O
I O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
in O
front O
of O
an O
investigating B-TER
police B-TER
officer O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
I O
gathered O
a O
lot O
of O
energy O
and O
I O
protested O
against O
our O
arrest B-TER
to O
him O
. O

He O
looked O
at O
me O
; O
he O
looked O
at O
my O
papers B-TER
; O
and O
he O
knew O
without O
doubt O
the O
correct O
decision O
. O

But O
he O
was O
well O
- O
meaning O
. O

He O
arranged O
for O
my O
immediate O
release B-TER
and O
gave O
me O
two O
officers O
with O
whom O
I O
then O
went O
to O
a O
neighbouring O
house O
for O
arrested B-TER
Jewish O
men B-TER
to O
fetch O
my O
husband O
. O

We O
had O
already O
been O
separated O
from O
my O
parents O
when O
we O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
Schutzhaus O
. O

They O
were O
lined O
up O
in O
rows O
of O
older O
people B-TER
and O
taken O
to O
a O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
learned O
that O
later O
and O
were O
able O
to O
find O
out O
their O
exact O
address O
through O
news O
smuggled B-TER
out I-TER
. O

Although O
we O
ourselves O
were O
harassed O
, O
we O
maintained O
contact O
with O
them O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
some O
non O
- O
Jewish O
friends O
, O
who O
were O
daring O
and O
prepared O
to O
make O
sacrifices O
said O
they O
were O
prepared O
to O
deliver O
messages O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

An O
attempt O
to O
smuggle B-TER
in O
food B-TER
parcels O
failed O
though O
. O

However O
, O
a O
good O
friend O
at O
least O
brought O
out O
a O
letter B-TER
and O
was O
able O
to O
speak O
to O
my O
parents O
personally O
. O

It O
was O
the O
last O
greeting O
he O
brought O
back O
to O
me O
from O
my O
mother O
. O

The O
poor O
thing O
died B-TER
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
18th O
of O
January O
1945 O
of O
hunger B-TER
and O
exhaustion O
. O

I O
also O
have O
to O
relate O
about O
the O
sad O
aftermath O
that O
was O
linked O
to O
this O
tragic O
event O
. O

In O
the O
clinic B-TER
where O
we O
had O
been O
hiding B-TER
ourselves O
, O
and O
which O
had O
been O
freed B-TER
by O
the O
Russians B-LOC
on O
the O
13th O
of O
January O
, O
we O
learned O
on O
the O
19th O
of O
January O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
had O
been O
liberated B-TER
on O
the O
previous O
day O
. O

Immediately O
, O
we O
made O
our O
way O
through O
the O
city O
which O
was O
completely O
devastated B-TER
and O
lying O
in O
rubble O
. O

Half O
way O
there O
, O
amongst O
the O
ruins O
, O
we O
met O
my O
father O
who O
was O
looking B-TER
for I-TER
us O
. O

He O
was O
so O
completely O
exhausted O
and O
aged O
by O
decades O
that O
I O
scarcely O
recognised O
him O
. O

When O
he O
gave O
me O
the O
awful O
news O
, O
we O
collapsed O
together O
. O

It O
lasted O
a O
fairly O
long O
time O
until O
I O
was O
myself O
again O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
city O
the O
battle B-TER
raged O
on O
. O

Huge O
waves O
of O
fire O
flared O
up O
. O

There O
was O
no O
mention O
in O
this O
chaos O
of O
any O
kind O
of O
funeral B-TER
. O

The O
dead B-TER
lay O
in O
their O
thousands O
unburied B-TER
on O
the O
streets O
and O
between O
the O
ruins O
. O

My O
poor O
mother O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
the O
cellar O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
house B-TER
. O

I O
tried O
in O
the O
next O
few O
days O
to O
find O
a O
coffin O
somewhere O
. O

My O
efforts O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

There O
was O
no O
coffin O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
large O
ruined O
city O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
made O
our O
way O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
the O
body B-TER
out O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
on O
a O
stretcher O
. O

Because O
the O
cemeteries B-TER
lay O
far O
outside O
of O
the O
city O
and O
were O
still O
under O
artillery B-TER
fire I-TER
, O
they O
were O
unreachable O
, O
therefore O
people B-TER
had O
begun O
in O
these O
days O
to O
bury B-TER
the O
dead B-TER
in O
situ O
in O
squares O
and O
in O
parks O
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
do O
that O
in O
the O
garden O
of O
the O
clinic B-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
long O
way O
, O
and O
a O
deep O
covering O
of O
snow O
had O
spread O
itself O
over O
the O
rubble O
strewn O
streets O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
another O
man B-TER
, O
a O
caretaker O
, O
made O
their O
way O
with O
the O
stretcher O
. O

However O
, O
they O
were O
both O
so O
exhausted O
through O
under O
- O
nourishment O
that O
they O
did O
not O
come O
very O
far O
with O
their O
sad O
load O
. O

On O
the O
way O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
all O
of O
the O
destruction B-TER
and O
horror O
, O
children B-TER
played O
in O
a O
square O
with O
a O
toboggan O
. O

We O
borrowed O
it O
; O
put O
the O
body B-TER
on O
it O
; O
and O
pulled O
it O
through O
the O
snow O
and O
between O
the O
ruins O
to O
the O
clinic B-TER
. O

There O
, O
my O
mother O
was O
temporarily O
buried B-TER
beside O
all O
of O
the O
other O
who O
died B-TER
during O
the O
struggle B-TER
. O

The O
intention O
was O
to O
transfer O
her O
later O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
battle B-TER
in O
an O
orderly O
ceremony O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
, O
and O
there O
to O
lay O
her O
to O
rest O
in O
eternal O
peace O
. O

However O
, O
the O
situation O
happened O
differently O
. O

Because O
the O
lack O
of O
food B-TER
also O
continued O
after O
the O
end O
of O
the O
siege B-TER
, O
and O
we O
were O
both O
extremely O
exhausted O
, O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
went O
to O
the O
provincial O
city O
of O
Szeged B-LOC
where O
the O
provisioning O
was O
better O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
my O
father O
was O
put O
in O
hospital B-TER
and O
slowly O
recovered O
his O
strength O
again O
. O

In O
the O
interim O
, O
the O
city O
administration B-TER
in O
Budapest B-LOC
began O
in O
March O
to O
exhume B-TER
those O
who O
were O
temporarily O
buried B-TER
during O
the O
siege B-TER
and O
transfer O
them O
to O
the O
central O
cemetery B-TER
. O

When O
we O
learnt O
that O
, O
we O
hurried O
to O
the O
clinic B-TER
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
but O
it O
was O
already O
too O
late O
. O

In O
a O
completely O
chaotic O
manner O
and O
without O
informing O
anyone O
, O
the O
exhumations B-TER
had O
begun O
precisely O
in O
this O
area O
, O
and O
all O
of O
my O
efforts O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
way O
to O
where O
the O
bodies B-TER
of O
the O
dead B-TER
were O
brought O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

We O
learned O
only O
that O
those O
exhumed B-TER
were O
buried B-TER
in O
a O
mass B-TER
grave I-TER
in O
the O
central O
cemetery B-TER
of O
Budapest B-LOC
. O

There O
is O
now O
a O
symbolic O
burial B-TER
mound O
there O
given O
information O
about O
the O
martyrdom O
of O
my O
dear O
mother O
. O

A O
memorial B-TER
plaques I-TER
for O
her O
is O
mounted O
in O
two O
synagogues B-TER
in O

in O
