History O
of O
the O
Jews O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
When O
the O
first O
Jews O
arrived O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
early O
in O
1938 O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
still O
largely O
run O
by O
criminals B-TER
imprisoned B-TER
there O
who O
completely O
went O
along O
with O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
their O
methods O
. O

The O
Jews O
involved O
, O
all O
1,000 O
of O
them O
, O
were O
taken O
there O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
so O
- O
called O
campaign O
- O
that O
is O
, O
the O
authorities B-TER
had O
simply O
arrested B-TER
people B-TER
en O
masse O
in O
several O
towns O
so O
as O
to O
spread O
terror O
among O
the O
rest O
and O
force O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
and O
give O
up O
their O
property B-TER
. O

The O
people B-TER
who O
were O
pulled O
in O
came O
from O
the O
widest O
variety O
of O
groups O
in O
terms O
of O
age O
and O
social O
origin O
and O
were O
consequently O
unable O
to O
unite O
in O
response O
to O
their O
persecution B-TER
. O

They O
had O
to O
camp B-TER
out I-TER
in O
an O
unfurnished O
cowshed B-TER
, O
where O
they O
made O
do O
with O
300 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
a O
3/4 O
litre O
of O
watery O
soup B-TER
a O
day O
. O

The O
prisoners B-TER
overseeing O
them O
regularly O
cheated O
them O
even O
of O
this O
. O

Their O
working B-TER
time O
was O
around O
14 O
to O
15 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
and O
the O
living B-TER
conditions I-TER
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
… O
… O
. O

meant O
that O
they O
could O
only O
think O
of O
sleeping O
for O
around O
5 O
hours O
a O
night O
. O

As O
result O
of O
constant O
harassment O
and O
attacks B-TER
, O
especially O
in O
the O
quarry O
, O
three O
of O
four O
a O
day O
were O
systematically O
bullied O
into O
trying O
to O
run B-TER
through O
the O
cordon O
of O
guards B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
shot B-TER
for O
attempting O
to O
escape O
. O

Aside O
from O
a O
small O
number O
who O
were O
released B-TER
, O
all O
of O
them O
were O
murdered B-TER
apart O
from O
a O
remnant O
of O
twenty O
who O
are O
still O
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
today O
. O

On O
each O
of O
the O
23rd O
and O
the O
24th O
of O
September O
1938 O
around O
a O
thousand O
more O
Jews O
arrived O
at O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
which O
now O
counted O
as O
a O
liquidation B-TER
camp B-TER
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
men B-TER
on O
both O
these O
transports B-TER
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
as O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
following O
the O
occupation B-TER
of O
Vienna B-LOC
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
mentioned O
above O
. O

Along O
with O
them O
though O
were O
some O
, O
partly O
long O
- O
term O
, O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
interned O
because O
of O
their O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
views O
. O

Over O
the O
following O
weeks O
and O
months O
, O
the O
struggle O
of O
these O
imprisoned B-TER
German B-LOC
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascists I-TER
reached O
its O
first O
high O
point O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
the O
overseers O
’ O
roles O
were O
purged O
of O
criminal B-TER
elements O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
found O
themselves O
in O
a O
position O
which O
was O
clearly O
more O
advantageous O
in O
that O
it O
led O
the O
Kommandant B-TER
to O
declare O
on O
30 O
January O
that O
prisoners B-TER
who O
oversaw O
the O
Jews O
would O
in O
future O
be O
Jews O
themselves O
. O

Later O
on O
these O
too O
came O
to O
include O
various O
negative O
and O
dangerous O
elements O
, O
but O
they O
were O
considerably O
easier O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
than O
if O
they O
had O
been O
so O
- O
called O
Aryans O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
way O
they O
were O
looked O
after O
and O
generally O
dealt O
with O
, O
and O
of O
their O
working B-TER
hours O
, O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
remained O
pariahs O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
and O
the O
great O
number O
of O
deaths B-TER
among O
them O
over O
the O
following O
years O
must O
be O
traced O
to O
that O
. O

On O
9th O
November O
1938 O
over O
12,000 O
Jews O
entered O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Rath B-PER
campaign O
. O

As O
they O
came O
in O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
armed O
with O
clubs O
and O
whips O
, O
were O
lined O
up O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Weimar B-LOC
so O
that O
only O
a O
few O
Jews O
reached O
the O
camp B-TER
uninjured O
. O

The O
streets O
, O
strewn O
with O
bloodied O
bits O
of O
luggage O
and O
clothing B-TER
with O
injured B-TER
people B-TER
lying O
among O
them O
, O
looked O
like O
a O
battlefield O
. O

These O
thousands O
of O
people B-TER
were O
put O
up O
in O
five O
emergency B-TER
barracks B-TER
where O
they O
lay O
up O
to O
four O
deep O
without O
any O
organisation O
, O
without O
latrines B-TER
, O
without O
sanitary B-TER
facilities I-TER
and O
without O
straw O
mattresses O
or O
blankets O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
and O
their O
mistreatment O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
who O
chased O
them O
round O
with O
whips O
and O
pistols O
, O
there O
was O
such O
utter O
chaos O
during O
the O
first O
night O
that O
you O
could O
easily O
think O
you O
were O
looking O
at O
a O
mutiny O
. O

Many O
were O
picked O
out O
at O
random O
for O
special O
reprisals B-TER
and O
chained O
hand O
to O
hand O
in O
circles O
so O
that O
dogs O
could O
be O
set O
on O
them O
, O
and O
seventy O
went O
mad B-TER
that O
night O
. O

They O
were O
thrown O
into O
a O
wooden O
shed O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
moved O
in O
groups O
to O
the O
cells B-TER
where O
they O
were O
beaten O
personally O
by O
Oberscharführer B-TER
Sommer B-PER
. O

Because O
the O
twelve O
thousand O
newcomers O
included O
a O
relatively O
large O
number O
of O
well O
- O
off O
business B-TER
people B-TER
, O
the O
SS B-TER
used O
this O
opportunity O
not O
only O
to O
satisfy O
their O
lust O
for O
killing B-TER
but O
also O
as O
a O
means O
to O
personal O
enrichment B-TER
. O

This O
went O
on O
right O
down O
to O
the O
lowliest O
SS B-TER
man I-TER
and O
in O
an O
almost O
unimaginable O
way O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
over O
loudspeakers O
that O
people B-TER
who O
handed O
their O
cars O
or O
houses B-TER
over O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
leadership I-TER
would O
be O
released B-TER
first O
. O

Coins O
and O
notes O
were O
in O
constant O
circulation O
around O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
their O
criminal B-TER
accomplices O
. O

They O
must O
have O
extorted O
thousands O
of O
Marks B-TER
every O
day O
on O
pretexts O
such O
as O
disturbance O
, O
damage O
, O
or O
release O
expenses O
. O

When O
the O
campaign O
ended O
with O
a O
mass O
release B-TER
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
- O
after O
it O
had O
cost O
hundreds O
of O
dead B-TER
- O
millions O
worth O
had O
gone O
through O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Their O
corruption B-TER
and O
their O
close O
financial B-TER
connections O
with O
criminal B-TER
prisoners B-TER
undermined O
the O
position O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

That O
contributed O
substantially O
to O
Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
's I-PER
decision O
to O
bite O
the O
sour O
apple O
and O
fill O
the O
camp B-TER
overseer I-TER
roles O
with O
political B-TER
prisoners B-TER
in O
order O
to O
regain O
command O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
war B-TER
in O
September O
1939 O
the O
Kommandant B-TER
forbade O
further O
medical B-TER
treatment I-TER
for O
Jews O
, O
an O
order O
which O
was O
silently O
ignored O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
. O

The O
next O
mass O
campaign O
saw O
around O
2,500 O
Jews O
delivered O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
mostly O
stateless B-TER
men B-TER
from O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
the O
occupied B-TER
territories I-TER
in O
the O
East O
. O

They O
were O
accommodated B-TER
behind O
barbed O
wire O
in O
five O
large O
tents B-TER
on O
the O
parade B-TER
ground I-TER
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
they O
were O
treated O
and O
fed B-TER
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
this O
little O
camp O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
notorious O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
Scharführers I-TER
Blank B-PER
and O
Hinkelmann B-PER
showed O
, O
as O
the O
SS B-TER
often O
said O
, O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
be O
liquidated B-TER
to O
the O
last O
man B-TER
. O

The O
group O
included O
the O
complete O
populations O
of O
various O
old O
people O
’s O
homes B-TER
and O
boarding O
schools B-TER
, O
and O
Camp B-TER
Leader I-TER
Hüttig B-PER
, O
shaking O
his O
head O
, O
said O
in O
my O
presence O
it O
’s O
unbelievable O
that O
they O
let O
this O
lot O
run O
around O
free O
up O
to O
now O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
they O
liquidated B-TER
them O
by O
the O
usual O
work B-TER
methods O
and O
by O
shooting B-TER
them O
while O
trying O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

Then O
they O
moved O
onto O
keeping O
them O
confined O
within O
their O
barbed O
wire O
enclosure O
, O
giving O
them O
half O
of O
the O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
, O
denying O
them O
underwear B-TER
, O
and O
leaving O
them O
standing O
so O
long O
on O
the O
parade O
ground O
in O
the O
winter O
weather O
that O
sixty O
of O
them O
were O
dying B-TER
every O
day O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
Scharführers B-TER
Blank B-PER
, O
Hinkelmann B-PER
and O
Sommer B-PER
got O
involved O
with O
particular O
enjoyment O
. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
several O
containers O
of O
poisoned O
food B-TER
were O
given O
out O
. O

From O
the O
start O
we O
fought O
a O
campaign O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
all O
this O
. O

Given O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
power O
relationships O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
we O
could O
only O
act O
against O
the O
SS B-TER
at O
one O
remove O
. O

But O
we O
had O
to O
act O
directly O
against O
their O
creatures O
among O
the O
prisoners B-TER
. O

We O
managed O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
foreman O
of O
the O
work B-TER
gang O
that O
took O
food B-TER
into O
the O
little O
camp B-TER
, O
putting O
our O
comrade O
Kurt B-PER
Posener I-PER
in O
his O
place O
, O
and O
he O
was O
able O
at O
the O
risk O
of O
his O
own O
life O
to O
smuggle B-TER
in O
extra O
food B-TER
for O
at O
least O
some O
of O
the O
comrades O
there O
. O

The O
two O
worst O
creatures O
, O
Wolf B-PER
and O
Rosenbaum B-PER
, O
stayed O
in O
their O
positions O
, O
but O
we O
managed O
to O
put O
in O
our O
Polish B-LOC
comrade O
Vulkan B-PER
as O
clerk O
, O
who O
through O
dedicated O
effort O
saved O
the O
lives O
of O
several O
further O
people B-TER
. O

Early O
in O
1940 O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
antifascist B-TER
Walter B-PER
Krämer I-PER
( O
murdered B-TER
in O
November O
1940 O
) O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
, O
succeeded O
in O
working B-TER
on O
the O
doctor B-TER
so O
as O
to O
evacuate B-TER
the O
entire O
hellhole O
on O
the O
grounds O
that O
it O
was O
spreading O
infection B-TER
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
and O
into O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
and O
the O
surrounding O
villages O
. O

A O
little O
before O
that O
, O
comrades O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
had O
managed O
to O
set O
up O
an O
illegal O
ambulance O
service O
there O
. O

This O
rescue B-TER
action O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
five O
hundred O
barely O
living O
skeletons O
into O
the O
main O
camp B-TER
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
following O
things O
had O
happened O
since O
the O
start O
of O
the O
war B-TER
. O

On O
the O
9th O
of O
November O
1939 O
, O
the O
day O
after O
the O
provocation O
of O
the O
so O
- O
called O
beer O
hall O
assassination B-TER
attempt I-TER
, O
all O
the O
Jews O
were O
locked O
in O
their O
barracks B-TER
, O
in O
darkness O
. O

A O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
, O
among O
them O
Scharführers B-TER
Blank B-PER
and O
Jännisch B-PER
, O
picked O
out O
21 O
young O
, O
strong O
men B-TER
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
quarry O
, O
where O
they O
were O
shot B-TER
trying O
to O
escape O
. O

The O
rest O
spent O
three O
whole O
days O
shut O
up O
with O
nothing B-TER
to I-TER
eat I-TER
and O
wondering O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

Since O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
then O
had O
to O
go O
five O
days O
without B-TER
food I-TER
, O
allegedly O
because O
a O
pig O
had O
been O
stolen O
, O
these O
measures O
had O
especially O
grave O
results O
. O

The O
emptying O
of O
the O
little O
camp O
, O
described O
above O
, O
had O
not O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
plans O
for O
murdering B-TER
its O
inmates B-TER
. O

They O
were O
assigned O
to O
workgroups B-TER
breaking O
or O
carrying O
rocks O
in O
the O
quarry O
( O
whose O
leaders O
were O
again O
Blank B-PER
and O
Hinkelmann B-PER
) O
where O
the O
bloody O
task O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
alongside O
the O
usual O
torments B-TER
and O
shootings B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
this O
did O
largely O
happen O
. O

The O
successful O
elimination O
of O
various O
creatures O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
constant O
struggle O
led O
to O
the O
then O
block O
leader O
of O
22 O
, O
the O
Jewish O
Berlin B-LOC
antifascist B-TER
Rudi B-PER
Arndt I-PER
, O
being O
denounced O
, O
replaced O
, O
and O
murdered B-TER
in O
the O
quarry O
on O
3 O
May O
1940 O
. O

Alongside O
the O
Thuringian B-LOC
comrade O
Ernst B-PER
Frommhold I-PER
, O
a O
camp B-TER
elder I-TER
who O
was O
released B-TER
, O
he O
had O
been O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
the O
organised O
struggle B-TER
against O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Fourteen O
days O
later O
Comrade O
Max B-PER
Vulkan I-PER
, O
mentioned O
above O
, O
was O
killed B-TER
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
myself O
had O
been O
an O
unobserved O
witness O
to O
Wolf B-PER
threatening B-TER
him O
If O
you O
ever O
say O
anything O
about O
what O
went O
on O
in O
the O
little O
camp O
, O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
you O
do O
n’t O
leave O
here O
alive O
! O
My O
attempt O
to O
compromise O
the O
camp B-TER
leader B-TER
of O
this O
gang O
and O
break O
his O
neck O
through O
an O
anonymous O
letter B-TER
to O
the O
camp B-TER
Kommandant B-TER
did O
not O
succeed O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
tried O
to O
check O
the O
handwriting O
of O
every O
prisoner B-TER
to O
find O
out O
who O
wrote O
it O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
that O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
difficult O
. O

In O
summer O
1940 O
Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
leader I-TER
Schobert B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
Florstadt B-PER
and O
several O
others O
from O
the O
command O
staff B-TER
visited O
the O
darning O
station O
that O
was O
being O
operated O
by O
sick B-TER
inmates B-TER
and O
sent O
all O
the O
Jews O
there O
to O
the O
quarry O
. O

Among O
those O
shot B-TER
on O
their O
first O
day O
at O
work B-TER
there O
was O
our O
Austrian B-LOC
comrade O
Hans B-PER
Kunke I-PER
. O

Alongside O
these O
special O
actions O
against O
Jewish O
groups O
or O
individuals O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
Jews O
were O
also O
obviously O
targeted O
for O
mass B-TER
death I-TER
through O
mistreatment B-TER
, O
hunger B-TER
, O
poisoning B-TER
by O
the O
camp B-TER
doctors B-TER
and O
so O
on O
. O

Given O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
, O
and O
despite O
all O
resistance B-TER
of O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
groups O
, O
Jews O
were O
always O
the O
worst O
placed O
group O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

In O
February O
1941 O
400 O
young O
Dutch B-LOC
Jews O
were O
brought O
to O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

Because O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
which O
we O
had O
fought O
for O
tooth O
and O
nail O
did O
not O
permit O
the O
mass B-TER
liquidation I-TER
which O
the O
SS B-TER
had O
planned O
they O
were O
transferred B-TER
to O
the O
camp B-TER
at O
Gusen B-LOC
near O
Mauthausen B-LOC
, O
where O
within O
eight O
days O
they O
were O
murdered B-TER
to O
the O
last O
man B-TER
. O

In O
the O
same O
year O
there O
was O
the O
first O
example O
of O
open O
resistance B-TER
to O
SS B-TER
murder B-TER
. O

Oberscharführer B-TER
Abraham B-PER
drowned B-TER
the O
Jewish O
prisoner B-TER
Hamber B-PER
in O
a O
puddle O
. O

His O
brother O
, O
formally O
questioned O
about O
the O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
as O
an O
eyewitness O
, O
told O
the O
truth O
. O

The O
entire O
work B-TER
group O
were O
then O
called O
to O
give O
evidence O
but O
understandably O
none O
of O
the O
others O
dared O
to O
say O
that O
they O
had O
seen O
anything O
. O

The O
foreman O
had O
to O
make O
a O
list O
of O
the O
names O
of O
his O
28 O
workers B-TER
. O

When O
he O
handed O
it O
over O
, O
Oberscharführer B-TER
Petrik B-PER
asked O
him O
Have O
you O
put O
your O
own O
name O
on O
the O
list O
? O
No O
! O
Then O
write O
your O
own O
name O
down O
as O
well O
! O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
were O
all O
sent O
back O
to O
their O
blocks O
. O

The O
murdered B-TER
man B-TER
’s I-TER
brother O
told O
me O
I O
know O
that O
I O
must O
die O
because O
of O
what O
I O
have O
said O
, O
but O
perhaps O
these O
criminals O
might O
hold O
back O
a O
little O
in O
future O
if O
they O
are O
afraid O
of O
being O
reported O
, O
and O
then O
I O
will O
not O
have O
died O
in O
vain O
. O

Around O
9 O
o’clock O
he O
was O
called O
to O
testify O
again O
and O
then O
to O
our O
astonishment O
came O
back O
to O
us O
half O
an O
hour O
later O
. O

Kommandant B-TER
Koch B-PER
, O
the O
Adjutant B-TER
, O
the O
camp B-TER
leader B-TER
, O
the O
Rapportführer B-TER
etc O
. O

had O
questioned O
him O
. O

The O
Kommandant B-TER
had O
said O
We O
want O
the O
complete O
truth O
from O
you O
. O

I O
give O
you O
my O
word O
of O
honour O
that O
nothing O
will O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

He O
repeated O
what O
he O
had O
said O
before O
. O

Around O
11.30 O
he O
was O
called O
out O
of O
the O
block O
again O
, O
went O
to O
the O
cells B-TER
and O
was O
dead B-TER
four O
days O
later O
. O

It O
seems O
likely O
that O
at O
least O
until O
1942 O
no O
Jew O
left O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
alive O
, O
irrespective O
of O
why O
he O
might O
have O
gone O
there O
. O

The O
29 O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O
listed O
as O
being O
in O
this O
work B-TER
group O
were O
all O
taken O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
one O
after O
another O
and O
each O
one O
died B-TER
on O
the O
fourth O
day O
. O

They O
tried O
in O
the O
stupidest O
way O
to O
cover O
up O
this O
multiple O
murder B-TER
which O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
knew O
about O
. O

One O
after O
another O
the O
next O
man O
on O
the O
list O
was O
transferred O
to O
another O
work B-TER
detail I-TER
a O
day O
or O
two O
beforehand O
, O
so O
as O
to O
disguise O
his O
membership O
of O
the O
group O
. O

One O
of O
them O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
with O
a O
broken B-TER
leg I-TER
, O
was O
carried O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
on O
a O
stretcher O
on O
Sommer B-PER
’s I-PER
orders O
and O
suffered O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
his O
colleagues O
. O

Another O
, O
a O
short O
shoemaker O
called O
Löwitus B-PER
, O
aged O
about O
40 O
, O
was O
released B-TER
before O
they O
got O
to O
him O
, O
because O
he O
could O
emigrate B-TER
to O
the O
SU O
as O
a O
citizen B-TER
of O
one O
of O
the O
Baltic O
States O
. O

The O
following O
examples O
will O
show O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
happened O
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
. O

Jochen B-PER
Pickard I-PER
, O
an O
antifascist B-TER
from O
the O
Rhineland B-LOC
, O
who O
was O
with O
me O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
and O
had O
after O
a O
while O
confessed O
to O
political B-TER
offences I-TER
in O
order O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
a O
penitentiary O
, O
was O
moved O
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
after O
he O
had O
finished O
his O
sentence O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
had O
not O
forgotten O
that O
he O
had O
for O
years O
denied O
all O
the O
allegations O
that O
had O
been O
thrown O
at O
him O
while O
he O
was O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
his O
arrival O
in O
Buchenwald B-TER
he O
went O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
, O
and O
did O
not O
leave O
it O
alive O
. O

Ernst B-PER
Heilmann I-PER
, O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
President O
of O
the O
Prussian O
Parliament O
, O
was O
put O
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
in O
1940 O
for O
no O
reason O
whatever O
and O
died B-TER
shortly O
afterwards O
. O

Kurt B-PER
Eisner I-PER
, O
the O
son O
of O
the O
Minister O
- O
President O
of O
Bavaria B-LOC
of O
the O
same O
name O
, O
who O
had O
already O
survived B-TER
several O
extraordinarily O
coldblooded O
attempts O
to O
murder B-TER
him O
, O
was O
questioned O
as O
a O
witness O
about O
some O
minor O
unpolitical O
nonsense O
involving O
another O
prisoner B-TER
. O

He O
told O
the O
Lagerführer B-TER
: O
I O
have O
been O
a O
prisoner B-TER
for O
ten O
years O
. O

You O
will O
not O
expect O
me O
to O
denounce B-TER
a O
comrade O
. O

He O
died B-TER
in O
the O
cell B-TER
block O
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1941 O
the O
notorious O
typhus B-TER
experiments B-TER
began O
. O

Ten O
Jews O
were O
chosen O
as O
the O
first O
victims B-TER
. O

There O
were O
fifty O
Jews O
in O
the O
next O
group O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
racial B-TER
superstitions I-TER
stopped O
them O
from O
using O
any O
more O
Jews O
, O
because O
their O
blood O
serum O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
injected O
into O
Aryans B-TER
. O

Early O
in O
1942 O
around O
400 O
Jews O
whom O
Dr O
Hoven B-PER
, O
the O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
, O
had O
declared O
unfit O
for O
work B-TER
were O
sent O
on O
so O
- O
called O
invalidtransports O
to O
a O
secret O
destination O
- O
this O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
experimental B-TER
poison O
gas B-TER
station O
. O

Over O
a O
year O
later O
the O
prisoner B-TER
records O
office O
was O
instructed O
to O
register O
these O
transports B-TER
as O
dead B-TER
. O

Hoven B-PER
told O
our O
comrade O
Weingärtner B-PER
( O
from O
Mannheim B-LOC
) O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
hospital I-TER
at O
that O
time O
If O
anything O
gets O
out O
about O
this O
, O
Weingärtner O
, O
we O
’ll O
both O
be O
hanged O
for O
it O
. O

He O
did O
not O
know O
that O
this O
apparent O
accomplice O
had O
in O
fact O
falsified O
the O
lists O
and O
rescued B-TER
a O
large O
number O
of O
comrades O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
our O
main O
task O
, O
in O
as O
far O
as O
we O
could O
not O
prevent O
these O
things O
from O
happening O
altogether O
, O
was O
to O
strengthen O
our O
cadres O
by O
protecting O
at O
least O
those O
comrades O
who O
were O
the O
most O
principled O
, O
cleanest O
, O
and O
most O
disposed O
to O
resistance B-TER
. O

An O
objective O
that O
was O
justified O
by O
success O
on O
11 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
transport B-TER
mentioned O
above O
took O
place O
over O
four O
days O
, O
on O
which O
three O
lorries O
drove O
up O
at O
morning O
parade O
and O
thirty O
men B-TER
whose O
names O
had O
been O
read O
out O
were O
loaded O
into O
each O
one O
. O

On O
the O
last O
day O
a O
lorry O
drove O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
where O
the O
sick B-TER
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
scheduled O
to O
go O
were O
thrown O
on O
wearing O
shirts B-TER
but O
no O
trousers B-TER
and O
driven O
off O
. O

On O
17 O
October O
1942 O
the O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
from O
all O
camps B-TER
, O
penitentiaries B-TER
and O
jails B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
to O
the O
liquidation B-TER
camp I-TER
at O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

I O
stayed O
behind O
with O
200 O
comrades O
who O
were O
retained O
as O
skilled O
armaments O
workers B-TER
. O

Our O
position O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
now O
for O
the O
time O
being O
substantially O
improved O
. O

First O
, O
systematic O
struggle O
by O
the O
illegally O
organised O
antifascists B-TER
had O
caused O
the O
practically O
complete O
elimination O
of O
antisemitism B-TER
, O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
been O
made O
immune O
to O
this O
plague O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
believed O
that O
they O
needed O
us O
as O
qualified O
workers B-TER
and O
therefore O
reined O
in O
their O
persecution B-TER
. O

In O
summer O
1943 O
we O
had O
another O
crisis O
. O

Scharführers B-TER
Schmidt B-PER
and O
Greuel B-PER
, O
Arbeitsführer B-TER
Simons B-PER
and O
Rapportführer B-TER
Hofschulte B-PER
along O
with O
Lagerführer B-TER
Gust B-PER
, O
camp B-TER
doctor B-TER
Hoven B-PER
and O
Wilhelm B-PER
, O
the O
SDG O
began O
a O
new O
liquidation O
campaign O
. O

The O
first O
two O
randomly O
reported O
a O
number O
of O
Jewish O
comrades O
for O
alleged O
idleness O
at O
work B-TER
. O

Simons B-PER
and O
Hofschulte B-PER
respectively O
authorised O
the O
floggings B-TER
and O
carried O
them O
out O
. O

Gust B-PER
transferred O
the O
victims B-TER
to O
the O
cellblock B-TER
and O
took O
them O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
the O
next O
day O
, O
where O
a O
poisoned B-TER
injection I-TER
by O
the O
management O
there O
saw O
to O
the O
rest O
. O

The O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
work O
of O
our O
comrades O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
succeeded O
in O
rescuing B-TER
some O
of O
the O
victims B-TER
and O
eventually O
stopping O
the O
campaign O
. O

Bribery B-TER
of O
the O
appropriate O
SS B-TER
criminals B-TER
played O
a O
role O
here O
, O
as O
so O
often O
. O

But O
15 O
comrades O
, O
among O
them O
the O
Czech B-LOC
antifascist B-TER
Max B-PER
Gallander I-PER
, O
died B-TER
. O

The O
pressure O
of O
this O
crisis O
for O
the O
first O
time O
raised O
the O
issue O
of O
forcible O
resistance B-TER
. O

Along O
with O
the O
responsible O
comrades O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
we O
were O
clear O
that O
any O
attempt O
at O
a O
general O
revolt B-TER
would O
have O
no O
prospect O
of O
success O
and O
thus O
could O
only O
have O
acted O
as O
a O
provocation O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
our O
efforts O
to O
stop O
this O
series O
of O
murders B-TER
in O
the O
ways O
usual O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
failed O
then O
we O
, O
as O
the O
responsible O
people B-TER
in O
the O
Jewish O
group O
, O
were O
determined O
to O
die B-TER
in O
a O
hopeless O
struggle O
rather O
than O
let O
ourselves O
be O
slaughtered O
one O
after O
the O
other O
like O
sheep O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
our O
previous O
work B-TER
then O
began O
to O
show O
themselves O
. O

The O
great O
majority O
of O
the O
Buchenwald B-LOC
Jews O
had O
trodden O
this O
path O
with O
us O
in O
contrast O
to O
all O
the O
millions O
who O
had O
allowed O
themselves O
to O
be O
murdered B-TER
without O
resistance B-TER
. O

The O
Warsaw B-LOC
Ghetto I-LOC
unfortunately O
still O
offers O
us O
the O
only O
exception O
to O
that O
. O

Constant O
withdrawal B-TER
of I-TER
rations I-TER
for O
the O
Jewish O
block O
, O
allegedly O
as O
a O
punishment O
, O
was O
taking O
place O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O
food B-TER
which O
was O
left O
over O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
was O
allocated O
to O
a O
number O
of O
other O
workgroups B-TER
. O

Solidarity O
among O
prisoners B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
showed O
itself O
in O
that O
these O
people B-TER
decided O
to O
hand O
this O
food B-TER
back O
to O
us O
even O
though O
they O
would O
have O
had O
to O
reckon O
with O
being O
punished O
if O
that O
became O
known O
. O

The O
Kammer O
, O
the O
Lagerschutz O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
brigade O
must O
be O
mentioned O
here O
above O
all O
, O
while O
other O
workgroups B-TER
whose O
members O
had O
not O
been O
so O
carefully O
vetted O
for O
antifascist B-TER
views O
could O
, O
through O
fear B-TER
of O
betrayal O
, O
only O
support O
us O
through O
individual O
actions O
by O
sympathetic O
comrades O
. O

The O
clerks O
’ O
office O
, O
work B-TER
statistics O
, O
block B-TER
elders I-TER
, O
and O
controllers O
must O
be O
added O
to O
the O
first O
- O
named O
workgroups B-TER
. O

It O
is O
of O
course O
obvious O
from O
what O
is O
said O
above O
that O
all O
these O
actions O
had O
to O
be O
kept O
secret O
so O
that O
most O
Buchenwald B-TER
inmates B-TER
were O
unaware O
of O
them O
. O

1944 O
brought O
a O
change O
to O
the O
position O
through O
the O
mass O
transfer B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
East O
. O

First O
, O
following O
the O
complete O
subjection O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
transports B-TER
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
consisting O
of O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
men B-TER
at O
a O
time O
arrived O
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
where O
they O
had O
been O
selected B-TER
as O
capable O
of O
work B-TER
. O

Along O
with O
these O
, O
growing O
numbers O
of O
evacuation B-TER
transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
the O
Polish B-LOC
camps B-TER
as O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
advanced O
. O

There O
was O
in O
practical O
terms O
as O
little O
accommodation B-TER
available O
for O
them O
as O
for O
the O
thousands O
upon O
thousands O
of O
non O
- O
Jews O
who O
were O
dragged O
here O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
leader B-TER
took O
the O
view O
that O
so O
long O
as O
they O
could O
still O
close O
the O
door O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
not O
over O
- O
full O
. O

The O
non O
- O

, O
self O
- O
sacrificing O
work B-TER
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ O
leadership B-TER
, O
above O
all O
Comrade O
Hans B-PER
Eidan I-PER
, O
succeeded O
by O
means O
of O
more O
or O
less O
open O
theft O
of O
SS B-TER
property O
in O
providing O
emergency B-TER
quarters O
, O
first O
in O
tents O
and O
later O
in O
emergency O
barracks B-TER
. O

These O
mass O
transports B-TER
were O
all O
put O
to O
work B-TER
outside O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
more O
or O
less O
condemned O
to O
waste O
slowly O
away O
in O
appalling O
conditions O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
develop O
any O
sense O
of O
unity O
and O
so O
had O
no O
leadership O
that O
could O
have O
stopped O
the O
worst O
happening O
. O

It O
is O
first O
of O
all O
the O
comrades O
in O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
office O
who O
must O
be O
thanked O
that O
we O
were O
able O
to O
extract O
not O
only O
the O
most O
actively O
helpful O
elements O
but O
also O
hundreds O
of O
children B-TER
and O
youths O
who O
would O
otherwise O
certainly O
have O
died B-TER
. O

And O
it O
is O
above O
all O
to O
the O
comrades O
from O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
and O
Polish B-LOC
sectors O
, O
who O
voluntarily O
took O
on O
fatigue O
duty O
in O
the O
so O
- O
called O
tent O
camp B-TER
, O
that O
we O
thank O
for O
the O
possibility O
in O
the O
short O
time O
we O
had O
at O
our O
disposal O
- O
sometimes O
a O
transport B-TER
of O
1,000 O
to O
1,500 O
was O
only O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
for O
three O
to O
four O
days O
- O
of O
sorting O
out O
the O
transports B-TER
so O
that O
we O
could O
free O
them O
from O
dangerous O
Nazi O
informants B-TER
and O
even O
sometimes O
set O
them O
up O
with O
their O
own O
leadership O
. O

A O
pleasant O
exception O
, O
which O
filled O
us O
with O
pride O
, O
was O
the O
evacuation B-TER
transport B-TER
from O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Monowitz I-LOC
. O

Here O
was O
a O
thorough O
, O
well O
- O
led O
, O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
prisoner B-TER
leadership O
. O

They O
were O
comrades O
from O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
who O
had O
been O
taken O
there O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
earlier O
. O

But O
one O
of O
our O
best O
people B-TER
, O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
anti B-TER
- I-TER
fascist I-TER
Erich B-PER
Eisler I-PER
- O
along O
with O
Rudi B-PER
Arndt I-PER
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
leaders O
of O
our O
work B-TER
- O
had O
been O
murdered B-TER
in O
the O
cells B-TER
at O
Auschwitz B-LOC
. O

By O
the O
autumn O
of O
1944 O
the O
outside O
work B-TER
groups O
which O
had O
been O
made O
up O
from O
men B-TER
in O
these O
transports B-TER
had O
turned O
so O
many O
work B-TER
-fit O
men B-TER
into O
cripples B-TER
that O
the O
so O
- O
called O
sick B-TER
transports B-TER
began O
to O
come O
back O
here O
to O
take O
them O
off O
to O
liquidation B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

The O
Magdeburg B-LOC
and O
Zeist B-LOC
work B-TER
groups O
alone O
sent O
back O
1,500 O
candidates O
for O
death B-TER
. O

The O
efforts O
of O
our O
comrades O
in O
the O
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
succeeded O
in O
removing O
around O
500 O
of O
them O
from O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
rather O
evident O
sabotage B-TER
by O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
and O
clerks O
’ O
offices O
yet O
others O
were O
kept O
here O
whom O
the O
SS B-TER
had O
listed O
to O
be O
taken O
away O
. O

But O
more O
than O
900 O
had O
to O
leave O
for O
Auschwitz B-TER
and O
death B-TER
, O
just O
before O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
’s O
activities O
there O
. O

Later O
on O
the O
work B-TER
leader O
demanded O
a O
list O
of O
children B-TER
in O
order O
to O
send O
them O
to O
the O
notorious O
camp B-TER
at O
Bergen B-LOC
- I-LOC
Belsen I-LOC
. O

Once O
again O
the O
work B-TER
statistics O
office O
managed O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
victims B-TER
to O
21 O
out O
of O
several O
hundred O
. O

The O
prisoner B-TER
sick B-TER
bay I-TER
helped O
here O
as O
well O
, O
just O
as O
it O
made O
a O
major O
contribution O
to O
everything O
that O
was O
achieved O
in O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

The O
continuously O
increasing O
overcrowding O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
meant O
that O
control O
by O
the O
SS B-TER
lacked O
the O
same O
intensity O
as O
before O
. O

The O
separation O
between O
Jews O
and O
non O
- O
Jews O
increasingly O
broke O
down O
as O
1944 O
went O
by O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Jewish O
comrades O
accordingly O
began O
to O
operate O
more O
or O
less O
closely O
alongside O
their O
corresponding O
national B-TER
groups O
. O

The O
constant O
defeats O
for O
the O
Nazis O
and O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
Allied B-TER
liberation B-TER
forces B-TER
meant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
long O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
to O
mount O
a O
special O
action O
against O
the O
Jews O
. O

Then O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
4 O
April O
came O
the O
sudden O
order B-TER
All O
Jews O
to O
fall O
in O
on O
the O
parade O
ground O
immediately O
! O
. O

None O
of O
us O
doubted O
what O
that O
meant O
. O

A O
rapid O
, O
spur O
of O
the O
moment O
discussion O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
open O
mutiny B-TER
of O
the O
whole O
camp B-TER
would O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
military B-TER
position O
, O
be O
pointless O
suicide B-TER
. O

However O
, O
obeying O
the O
order B-TER
- O
even O
though O
we O
would O
have O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
obey O
it O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
- O
would O
, O
equally O
, O
be O
cowardice O
. O

So O
we O
went O
in O
for O
open O
sabotage B-TER
: O
no O
- O
one O
went O
to O
the O
parade O
ground O
. O

On O
the O
urging O
of O
the O
active O
elements O
hundreds O
, O
if O
not O
thousands O
, O
fled O
to O
their O
non O
- O
Jewish O
comrades O
in O
different O
barracks B-TER
, O
the O
documentation O
in O
the O
blocks O
was O
burned O
, O
and O
the O
clerks O
’ O
office O
declared O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
put O
together O
a O
list O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
in O
a O
short O
time O
. O

The O
Lagerschutz O
claimed O
that O
they O
could O
not O
find O
the O
Jews O
and O
in O
any O
case O
were O
not O
able O
to O
force O
eight O
thousand O
people B-TER
together O
with O
a O
team O
of O
only O
one O
hundred O
! O
The O
SS B-TER
hesitated O
and O
put O
the O
parade O
off O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

It O
all O
ended O
according O
to O
plan O
with O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
intentions O
as O
a O
result O
of O
open O
mutiny B-TER
among O
the O
active O
elements O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
the O
passive O
resistance B-TER
of O
the O
non O
- O
Jewish O
comrades O
. O

Around O
half O
, O
about O
3,000 O
, O
had O
fled B-TER
again O
and O
hidden B-TER
themselves O
among O
the O
others O
. O

These O
men B-TER
were O
of O
course O
the O
most O
active O
and O
determined O
to O
resist B-TER
. O

True O
to O
the O
order B-TER
that O
had O
been O
given O
out O
not O
to O
give O
up O
without O
a O
fight O
our O
comrade O
Kurt B-PER
Baum I-PER
from O
Herne B-LOC
, O
an O
antifascist B-TER
who O
had O
been O
locked O
up O
since O
1935 O
, O
attacked O
the O
Scharführer B-TER
who O
had O
run O
him O
down O
in O
his O
hiding B-TER
place I-TER
with O
a O
spade O
and O
fell O
as O
the O
first O
victim B-TER
. O

But O
the O
block B-TER
leaders I-TER
were O
baffled O
and O
the O
search O
was O
not O
continued O
. O

3,000 O
Jewish O
prisoners B-TER
were O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
illegally O
. O

With O
that O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
totally O
lost O
control O
of O
the O
situation O
. O

The O
good O
effects O
of O
this O
development O
showed O
themselves O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

It O
had O
become O
significantly O
easier O
to O
hide B-TER
the O
46 O
comrades O
who O
were O
supposed O
to O
have O
been O
liquidated B-TER
, O
to O
whom O
I O
myself O
had O
been O
added O
to O
due O
to O
the O
sabotage B-TER
of O
the O
Jewish O
transport B-TER
. O

What O
happened O
in O
the O
next O
week O
does O
not O
belong O
here O
, O
as O
it O
concerns O
the O
camp B-TER
as O
a O
whole O
. O

This O
chapter O
ends O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
11 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
present O
report O
can O
obviously O
only O
set O
out O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
development O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Buchenwald B-LOC
and O
is O
only O
intended O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
only O
goes O
into O
details O
where O
these O
are O
especially O
typical O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
significance O
of O
some O
specific O
events O
can O
only O
be O
understood O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
overall O
history O
of O
Buchenwald B-TER
. O

This O
can O
not O
be O
dealt O
with O
here O
, O
although O
some O
of O
the O
content O
of O
the O
various O
reports O
will O
constantly O
recur O
. O

In O
all O
the O
events O
mentioned O
I O
was O
either O
present O
myself O
or O
learned O
of O
them O
directly O
from O
those O
involved O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
our O
work B-TER
and O
our O
struggle O
developed O
taught O
us O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
to O
operate O
using O
the O
rules O
of O
Jewish O
life O
which O
we O
know O
and O
obey O
in O
freedom O
. O

Our O
struggle O
for O
survival B-TER
against O
the O
SS B-TER
could O
not O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
an O
orthodox O
, O
liberal O
, O
Zionist B-TER
or O
socialist O
way O
. O

There O
was O
clearly O
only O
one O
option O
- O
unity O
among O
everyone O
who O
was O
willing O
to O
resist B-TER
, O
on O
the O
common O
basis O
of O
antifascism B-TER
. O

We O
rejected O
all O
those O
believers O
who O
preached O
that O
we O
should O
surrender O
to O
the O
Hitler B-PER
barbarism O
as O
a O
deserved O
punishment O
from O
God O
for O
a O
lack O
of O
piety O
among O
the O
Jews O
just O
as O
we O
rejected O
the O
cynicism O
of O
the O
informers B-TER
who O
would O
sell O
their O
brother O
for O
a O
slice O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
killed O
the O
Nazi O
bacillus O
within O
the O
barbed O
wire O
, O
even O
when O
the O
SS B-TER
were O
still O
in O
the O
watchtowers O
. O

Every O
Jew O
who O
, O
thinking O
and O
fighting O
, O
survived B-TER
Buchenwald B-LOC
will O
and O
must O
know O
his O
duty O
