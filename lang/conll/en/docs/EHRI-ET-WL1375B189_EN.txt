I O
can O
not O
describe O
here O
in O

short O
lines O
all O
the O
dreadful O
and O
horrible O
things O
that O
I O
experienced O
just O
five O
months O
ago O
. O

Even O
if O
I O
were O
to O
speak O
about O
it O
for O
years O
, O
it O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
relate O
everything O
that O
I O
suffered O
personally O

I O
will O
try O
to O
report O
a O
little O

however O
, O
of O

only O
that O
which O
I O
personally O

The O
days O
after O
the O
13th O
March O
1938 O
: O
At O
this O
time O
Nazis O
armed O
with O
revolvers O
and O
fixed O
bayonets O
often O
intruded O
into O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
and O
businesses B-TER
to O
loot B-TER
them O
. O

Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
were O
daubed B-TER
with O
white O
or O
black O
paint O
and O
next O
to O
drawings O
which O
were O
supposed O
to O
show O
Jews O
one O
could O
read O
the O
following O
inscription O
on O
every O
Jewish B-TER
business I-TER
: O
JUD O
oder O
SAUJUD O
[ O
Jew O
or O
Jewish O
Pig O
] O
, O
some O
time O
later O
: O
BIN O
SCHON O
IN O
DACHAU O
[ O
Already O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
] O
etc O
. O

Jewish B-TER
businesses I-TER
were O
placed O
under O
the O
management O
of O
Aryan B-TER
commissioners O
if O
they O
had O
not O
been O
arisiert O
[ O
Aryanised O
] O
straight O
away O
, O
which O
means O
they O
were O
robbed B-TER
by O
Nazis O
. O

Jewish B-TER
lawyers I-TER
were O
deprived B-TER
of O
the O
right O
to O
practise O
their O
profession O
. O

15,000 O
Jews O
were O
already O
out O
of O
work O
in O
April O
and O
being O
fed O
by O
the O
Israelitisch B-TER
Kultusgemeinde I-TER
[ O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
] O
. O

Men B-TER
and O
women B-TER
were O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
together O
at O
random O
on O
the O
streets O
or O
fetched O
from O
homes B-TER
by O
the O
brown[-shirted O
] O
hordes O
for O
Reiben O
[ O
washing O
] O
. O

They O
had O
to O
wash O
off O
the O
labels O
of O
the O
old O
regime O
, O
at O
which O
they O
were O
laughed B-TER
at I-TER
and O
mistreated B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
SA B-ORG
occupied O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
in O
order O
to O
listen O
to O
Hitler B-PER
's I-PER
speeches O
on O
the O
radio B-TER
. O

On O
the O
streets O
elderly O
Jews O
not O
infrequently O
were O
made B-TER
to O
perform O
military O
exercises O
or O
gymnastics O
. O

Imprisonments B-TER
begin O
: O
If O
a O
Jew O
attempted O
to O
leave O
for O
abroad O
he O
was O
arrested B-TER
, O
because O
he O
was O
presumed O
to O
be O
a O
Fluchtgefahr O
[ O
escape O
risk O
] O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
a O
Jew O
had O
not O
attempted O
to O
leave O
, O
then O
he O
wanted O
to O
remain O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
was O
arrested B-TER
anyway O
! O
Prominent O
Vienna B-LOC
Jews O
mostly O
came O
into O
Schutzhaft O
protective O
custody O
. O

Life O
became O
insufferable O
and O
scores O
of O
Viennese B-LOC
made O
an O
end B-TER
to I-TER
their I-TER
lives I-TER
of O
their O
own O
free O
will O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
their O
arrest B-TER
, O
though O
it O
often O
seemed O
that O
they O
had O
been O
shot B-TER
by O
the O
Nazis O
who O
had O
forced O
their O
way O
into O
their O
homes O
. O

Thousands O
of O
large O
lorries O
were O
driven O
by O
young O
Nazis O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Vienna B-LOC
shouting O
Juda O
verrecke O
[ O
perish O
Judah O
] O
. O

Nowhere O
was O
safe O
for O
life O
as O
a O
Jew O
any O
more O
, O
since O
even O
a O
five B-TER
- I-TER
year I-TER
- I-TER
old I-TER
boy O
had O
a O
knife O
20 O
cm O
long O
, O
with O
which O
he O
threatened B-TER
Saujuden O
or O
was O
allowed O
to O
or O
should O
injure O
them O
. O

I O
myself O
attended O
a O
Realgymnasium O
[ O
secondary O
school B-TER
] O
where O
the O
majority O
of O
pupils B-TER
were O
Aryan B-TER
. O

After O
Hitler B-PER
invaded O
, O
the O
Aryan B-TER
pupils B-TER
Jewish B-TER
ones I-TER
so O
severely O
that O
the O
Nazi O
director O
of O
our O
establishment O
felt O
obliged O
to O
issue O
the O
following O
instruction O
: O
Aryanpupils O
in O
future O
will O
not O
be O
aggressive O
towards O
Jewish O
pupils O
in O
the O
school O
building O
, O
since O
the O
fate O
of O
these O
people O
is O
being O
determined O
outside O
the O
school O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
this O
directive O
naturally O
had O
not O
the O
slightest O
effect O
on O
the O
German O
- O
Aryan O
pupils B-TER
equipped O
with O
revolvers O
, O
knives O
, O
boots B-TER
, O
brown O
and O
white O
shirts B-TER
: O
they O
continued O
to O
come O
to O
lessons O
in O
the O
same O
garb O
and O
clearly O
showed O
that O
the O
Nazis O
were O
there O
now O
. O

After O
a O
while O
I O
had O
to O
attend O
a O
Jewish O
school O
, O
at O
which O
young O
, O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
professors O
were O
said O
to O
deliver O
lessons O
on O
all O
subjects O
. O

They O
did O
not O
do O
this O
, O
and O
contented O
themselves O
with O
coming O
to O
school O
in O
SS B-ORG
uniform B-TER
and O
threatening O
the O
poor O
Jewish B-TER
pupils I-TER
. O

Outside O
school B-TER
one O
did O
not O
have O
to O
Reiben O
[ O
wash O
] O
any O
more O
. O

Homes B-TER
were O
no O
longer O
occupied O
by O
Nazis O
who O
wanted O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
radio B-TER
or O
loot B-TER
valuables O
; O
no O
one O
was O
raided O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
the O
home B-TER
, I-TER
and O
almost O
every O
Vienna B-LOC
Jew O
was O
arrested B-TER
and O
dispatched O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

The O
period O
of O
mass O
arrests B-TER
had O
begun O
... O
If O
someone O
rang O
at O
the O
door O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
, O
one O
did O
not O
open O
it O
for O
fear B-TER
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

One O
dreaded O
going O
to O
the O
telephone O
, O
and O
one O
dared O
not O
speak O
in O
one O
’s O
own O
home B-TER
, O
because O
a O
microphone O
could O
have O
been O
installed O
somewhere O
and O
a O
rash O
word O
meant O
arrest B-TER
. O

If O
two O
Jews O
walked O
together O
in O
the O
street O
then O
they O
were O
exposed O
to O
the O
danger O
of O
being O
arrested B-TER
by O
the O
SA B-ORG
, O
and O
if O
they O
did O
not O
give O
the O
identical O
answer O
to O
the O
Nazis O
’ O
question O
on O
what O
they O
had O
been O
speaking O
about O
, O
then O
they O
would O
be O
arrested B-TER
immediately O
. O

During O
these O
months O
I O
spent O
more O
than O
one O
day O
unhappy O
, O
more O
than O
one O
night O
sleepless O
. O

In O
Vienna B-LOC
every O
Jew O
aged O
over O
18 O
years O
was O
threatened B-TER
with O
unfounded O
arrest B-TER
and O
the O
SPECTRE O
OF O
DACHAU B-LOC
! O
On O
some O
days O
, O
orders O
came O
from O
Herr O
[ B-PER
Josef I-PER
] I-PER
Bürckel I-PER
[ O
Gauleiter B-TER
of O
Vienna B-LOC
] O
, O
and O
then O
, O
for O
example O
, O
2,000 O
or O
another O
time O
again O
800 O
Jews O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

Neither O
my O
father O
nor O
my O
uncle O
avoided O
unfounded O
arrest B-TER
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
as O
I O
stood B-TER
in O
front O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
for O
endless O
days O
and O
nights O
crying O
and O
confused O
, O
so O
did O
many O
children B-TER
whose O
fathers O
, O
and O
many O
, O
many O
women B-TER
, O
whose O
husbands O
or O
sons O
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
without O
reason O
. O

Mostly O
all O
attempts O
for O
release B-TER
were O
in O
vain O
, O
and O
after O
two O
days O
the O
transport B-TER
went O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

Jews O
were O
rounded B-TER
up I-TER
in O
the O
streets O
, O
from O
homes B-TER
, O
from O
businesses B-TER
and O
coffeehouses O
, O
no O
longer O
for O
Reiben O
but O
for O
Freifahrt O
nach O
Dachau O
[ O
free O
travel O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
] O
, O
as O
the O
noble O
Nazis O
described O
it O
. O

There O
is O
no O
Jewish O
family B-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
who O
is O
not O
affected O
by O
this O
insufferable O
misfortune O
; O
at O
least O
one O
man B-TER
from O
every O
family B-TER
is O
in O
Schutzhaft B-TER
[ O
protective O
custody O
] O
and O
whilst O
he O
is O
being O
tortured B-TER
and O
martyred O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
or O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
his O
relatives B-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
are O
close O
to O
despair O
. O

People O
place O
such O
suffering O
upon O
people O
! O
Whilst O
I O
am O
writing O
this O
and O
no O
longer O
suffer O
, O
things O
are O
even O
worse O
for O
the O
poor O
Jews O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
than O
at O
the O
time O
when O
I O
was O
still O
there O
. O

Evidence O
should O
be O
the O
lines O
written O
to O
me O
by O
a O
lady B-TER
who O
has O
also O
escaped B-TER
that O
hell O
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
what O
was O
reported O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
who O
is O
already O
in O
a O
foreign O
country O
. O

The O
lady B-TER
in O
question O
writes O
: O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
to O
you O
what O
we O
have O
been O
part O
of O
, O
because O
a O
book O
would O
not O
suffice O
to O
record O
everything O
that O
we O
had O
to O
experience O
and O
suffer O
. O

I O
lived O
with O
my O
relative O
Dr. O
N. O
since O
1st O
November O
. O

On O
the O
Thursday O
in O
question O
there O
were O
house O
searches O
for O
every O
Jew O
, O
and O
then O
we O
were O
all O
locked O
up O
, O
even O
the O
child O
. O

The O
10 O
mark O
note O
that O
my O
cousin O
had O
lent O
me O
was O
taken O
from O
me O
though O
that O
was O
everything O
I O
possessed O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
sign O
that O
I O
had O
all O
my O
possessions O
. O

In O
Aachen O
I O
was O
stripped O
bare O
, O
and O
then O
a O
train O
was O
going O
to O
Brussels O
, O
and O
I O
took O
this O
train O
, O
to O
be O
able O
at O
last O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
hell O
. O

A O
friend O
reports O
: O
Firstly O
, O
I O
must O
apologise O
for O
my O
long O
silence O
. O

So O
much O
has O
happened O
since O
I O
last O
wrote O
to O
you O
that O
I O
could O
neither O
reply O
to O
any O
letters B-TER
nor O
pay O
any O
visits O
, O
because O
the O
events O
left O
me O
not O
a O
minute O
free O
. O

We O
, O
i.e. O
my O
family B-TER
, O
had O
to O
survive O
imprisonment B-TER
and O
a O
house O
search O
... O
After O
endless O
queuing O
and O
much O
running O
about O
we O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
obtaining O
a O
[ O
tax O
certificate O
] O
and O
thus O
we O
have O
fortunately O
arrived B-TER
in O
X O
... O
You O
can O
hardly O
imagine O
what O
has O
played O
out O
in O
Germany B-TER
since O
the O
assassination B-TER
of O
Ambassador B-TER
vom B-PER
Rath I-PER
. O

That O
we O
were O
not O
arrested B-TER
or O
looted B-TER
on O
that O
black O
Thursday O
is O
only O
attributable O
to O
the O
exemplary O
and O
honourable O
behaviour B-TER
of O
our O
Blockleiter O
[ O
block O
leader O
] O
. O

In O
total O
, O
roughly O
2,500 O
male O
youths B-TER
of O
our O
age O
( O
18 O
years O
! O
) O
were O
sent O
to O
Dachau B-LOC
... O
It O
is O
so O
dreadful O
that O
one O
can O
not O
write O
about O
what O
I O
alone O
have O
seen O
. O

One O
can O
not O
really O
celebrate O
one O
’s O
freedom O
when O
one O
thinks O
of O
the O
lot O
of O
those O
who O
are O
left O
behind O
in O
that O
hell O
