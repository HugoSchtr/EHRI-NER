Rosa B-PER
Rachel I-PER
Schwarz I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department I-TER
until O
1940 O
, O
most O
recently O
also O
of O
social B-TER
welfare I-TER
for O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
Vienna I-ORG
, O
told O
me O
today O
: O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
’s O
true O
about O
the O
many O
unfavorable O
stories O
about O
Murmelstein B-PER
from O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

I O
know O
him O
from O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
some O
characteristic O
things O
about O
him O
that O
I O
have O
experienced O
. O

He O
was O
petty O
, O
pedantic O
and O
in O
no O
way O
ready O
to O
help O
his O
fellow O
men O
. O

From O
the O
time O
of O
the O
occupation B-TER
, O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
, O
he O
worked O
for O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

His O
task O
was O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
issue O
passes B-TER
, O
i.e. O
to O
certify O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
employees O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
who O
were O
on O
afternoon O
or O
evening O
duty O
were O
allowed O
to O
walk O
the O
streets O
at O
a O
time O
that O
was O
otherwise O
forbidden B-TER
for I-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

Now O
, O
there O
was O
a O
young O
girl O
among O
the O
employees B-ORG
who O
was O
to O
emigrate B-TER
the O
next O
day O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
day O
she O
was O
still O
working O
in O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

If O
she O
got O
a O
pass B-TER
for O
the O
evening O
, O
she O
could O
say O
goodbye O
to O
her O
friends O
. O

She O
asked O
Murmelstein B-PER
for O
a O
pass B-TER
, O
but O
he O
refused O
. O

I O
then O
asked O
him O
why O
he O
had O
refused O
, O
and O
he O
replied O
that O
since O
noon O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
an O
employee B-ORG
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

Everybody O
else O
would O
, O
of O
course O
, O
have O
issued O
the O
certificate B-TER
under O
the O
circumstances O
at O
that O
time O
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
, O
I O
was O
with O
Dr. O
Löwenherz B-PER
in O
the O
evening O
; O
it O
was O
a O
private O
visit O
, O
shortly O
before O
my O
emigration B-TER
. O

I O
had O
no O
pass B-TER
; O
I O
always O
dared O
to O
go O
without O
it O
. O

Murmelstein B-PER
, O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
house O
, O
came O
to O
visit O
Löwenherz B-PER
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
I O
said O
goodbye O
because O
I O
did O
n’t O
like O
being O
with O
him O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
fearful O
, O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
a O
pass B-TER
. O

I O
said O
no O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
asked O
why O
I O
had O
not O
turned O
to O
Murmelstein B-PER
. O

I O
replied O
: O
because O
I O
do O
not O
turn O
to O
a O
man O
like O
Mr. O
Murmelstein O
( O
said O
in O
his O
presence O
! O
) O
, O
since O
he O
would O
have O
refused O
me O
, O
because O
my O
visiting O
you O
is O
not O
official O
, O
but O
private O
. O

Löwenherz B-PER
said O
: O
And O
if O
something O
happens O
to O
you O
? O
I O
replied O
: O
Then O
it O
’s O
only O
you O
having O
the O
troubles O
of O
it O
, O
because O
you O
must O
then O
get O
me O
out O
again O
for O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department I-TER
. O

But O
Löwenherz B-PER
did O
n’t O
let O
up O
, O
and O
made O
Murmelstein B-PER
to O
issue O
me O
a O
pass B-TER
on O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
. O

About O
the O
social B-TER
work I-TER
of O
the O
community B-ORG
Vienna I-ORG
under O
Hitler B-PER
Saturday O
, O
March O
12 O
, O
1938 O
, O
the O
vanguard O
of O
the O
German B-ORG
military I-ORG
marched O
into O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

On O
Sunday O
, O
the O
Viennese B-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
community I-ORG
opened O
its O
offices O
in O
the O
usual O
manner O
. O

Formally O
, O
there O
was O
no O
change O
to O
notice O
. O

There O
were O
almost O
no O
clients O
in O
the O
welfare B-ORG
department I-ORG
; O
at O
noon O
Professor O
Julius B-PER
Zappert I-PER
Name O
in O
the O
original O
spaced O
out O
( O
manager O
of O
the O
youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
) O
appeared O
and O
announced O
that O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
outpatient I-TER
clinic I-TER
in O
Rauscherstrasse B-LOC
was O
occupied O
. O

I O
forwarded O
this O
message O
to O
the O
directorate B-ORG
and O
we O
hoped O
that O
this O
building O
, O
which O
is O
particularly O
important O
for O
our O
welfare B-ORG
department I-ORG
, O
would O
soon O
be O
vacated O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
our O
children B-TER
at O
risk O
. O

In O
the O
next O
two O
to O
three O
days O
the O
first O
parties O
came O
to O
the O
welfare B-ORG
department I-ORG
and O
complained O
about O
hardships O
imposed O
on O
them O
by O
neighbours O
and O
people O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O

Wednesday O
, O
March O
16 O
, O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
someone O
from O
the O
authority O
came O
to O
the O
congregation B-ORG
. O

They O
checked O
the O
bookkeeping O
and O
accounting O
, O
requisitioned O
typewriters O
and O
calculating O
machines O
, O
and O
recorded O
the O
status O
of O
the O
cash O
desk O
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
department I-ORG
was O
already O
working O
with O
the O
general B-ORG
department I-ORG
. O

The O
clients O
were O
no O
longer O
dealt O
with O
on O
file O
, O
but O
in O
the O
antechambers O
of O
the O
welfare B-ORG
centre I-ORG
, O
which O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
one O
room O
, O
the O
requests O
of O
clients O
asking O
for O
support O
were O
quickly O
registered O
in O
files O
, O
filled O
in O
with O
only O
the O
most O
necessary O
data O
, O
and O
each O
applicant O
received O
a O
few O
shillings O
so O
that O
he O
could O
buy O
bread B-TER
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
we O
worked O
until O
Friday O
9 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Then O
the O
house O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
individual O
offices O
were O
searched O
, O
desks O
and O
files O
examined O
, O
and O
the O
requesting O
clients O
, O
their O
number O
went O
into O
the O
hundreds O
, O
photographed O
together O
with O
the O
clerks O
. O

At O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
the O
telephone O
line O
was O
disconnected O
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
occupied O
the O
house O
telephone O
. O

A O
quiet O
rumor O
had O
reached O
us O
that O
the O
presidium B-ORG
and O
the O
head B-ORG
office I-ORG
were O
put O
under O
the O
strictest O
surveillance B-TER
and O
some O
of O
them O
had O
already O
been O
arrested B-TER
. O

The O
eviction O
order O
arrived O
at O
about O
12 O
noon O
. O

And O
while O
we O
were O
leaving O
our O
workplaces O
in O
a O
daze O
, O
a O
characteristic O
scene O
occurred O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house O
: O
- O
3 O
- O
A O
man O
breathlessly O
approached O
the O
secret B-ORG
police I-ORG
officer I-ORG
on O
duty O
and O
told O
him O
: O
A O
shop O
on O
the O
next O
corner O
is O
being O
looted O
. O

This O
is O
bad O
for O
your O
good O
reputation O
and O
ca O
n’t O
be O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Führer O
. O

And O
the O
officer B-ORG
in O
charge O
went O
to O
the O
shop O
and O
stopped O
the O
looting B-TER
. O

From O
that O
day O
on O
, O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
closed O
for O
about O
five O
weeks O
. O

The O
presidents B-ORG
and O
directors B-ORG
were O
locked B-TER
up I-TER
. O

We O
leading O
officials B-ORG
met O
daily O
, O
first O
in O
a O
small O
coffee O
house O
on O
the O
Salzgries B-LOC
street O
and O
when O
this O
was O
closed O
, O
in O
a O
still O
Jewish B-TER
coffee I-TER
house I-TER
on O
the O
Quai B-LOC
. O

There O
we O
had O
breakfast B-TER
and O
accidentally O
met O
acquaintances O
. O

Operations O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
( O
institutions O
) O
continued O
. O

I O
was O
busy O
to O
provide O
the O
homes B-TER
with O
the O
most O
necessary O
material O
as O
well O
as O
with O
victuals B-TER
, O
to O
relieve O
them O
of O
the O
transactions O
with O
the O
different O
offices B-ORG
, O
and O
especially O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
those O
in O
charge O
in O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
homes I-TER
, O
who O
stood O
pedagogically O
at O
the O
highest O
level O
, O
but O
were O
not O
up O
to O
the O
traffic O
with O
the O
very O
changed O
authorities B-ORG
. O

- O
In O
these O
difficult O
times O
, O
director O
Engel B-PER
Name O
in O
the O
original O
spaced O
out O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
particularly O
prudent O
adviser O
and O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
helped O
to O
overcome O
all O
difficulties O
that O
arose O
. O

The O
first O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
to O
be O
occupied O
was O
the O
Dr. B-TER
Kruger I-TER
Lehrmädchenheim I-TER
Home O
for O
apprentice O
girls O
. O

But O
we O
soon O
managed O
to O
bring O
some O
of O
the O
girls B-TER
back O
to O
the O
home B-TER
. O

Special O
difficulties O
arose O
in O
the O
home B-TER
for I-TER
abandoned I-TER
girls I-TER
in O
the O
XIII B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
Auhofstrasse B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
succeeded O
in O
keeping O
this O
home B-TER
for O
several O
months O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
strictly O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
, O
there O
was O
also O
an O
interconfessional O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
in O
the O
XIX B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
a O
Wertheimstein´sche O
foundation O
for O
children B-TER
of O
all O
denominations O
. O

According O
to O
an O
announcement O
of O
the O
municipality B-ORG
, O
this O
home B-TER
was O
declared O
a O
strictly O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
one O
day O
. O

The O
Aryan B-TER
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
placed O
elsewhere O
immediately O
. O

Twenty O
- O
four O
hours O
after O
this O
announcement O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
home B-TER
informed O
me O
that O
her O
home B-TER
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
National B-ORG
Socialist I-ORG
Women I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Party I-ORG
NS O
- O
Frauenschaft O
, O
the O
women O
’s O
wing O
of O
the O
NSDA O
and O
that O
all O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
transferred O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
immediately O
drove O
out O
to O
the O
home O
and O
tried O
to O
get O
the O
deadline O
extended O
, O
tried O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
house O
, O
since O
the O
babies B-TER
- O
4 O
- O
and O
toddlers B-TER
could O
not O
be O
accommodated O
together O
with O
schoolchildren B-TER
. O

With O
difficulty O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
24 O
- O
hour O
deferral O
. O

Some O
Jewish B-TER
villas I-TER
were O
occupied O
, O
but O
no O
owner O
would O
have O
dared O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
in O
his O
house O
, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
attract O
attention O
, O
the O
only O
solution O
was O
the O
infirmary O
of O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
. O

A O
temporary O
solution O
, O
and O
we O
prayed O
that O
no O
child B-TER
would O
fall O
ill O
in O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
. O

We O
were O
therefore O
anxious O
to O
find O
a O
suitable O
roof O
for O
our O
children B-TER
. O

When O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
reopened O
, O
we O
immediately O
tried O
to O
get O
a O
foundation O
house O
free O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

The O
house O
belonging O
to O
the O
Theresianerkreuz O
- O
Verein O
in O
Untere O
Augartenstrasse B-LOC
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
and O
requiring O
the O
least O
investment O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
and O
been O
given O
furniture O
by O
emigrating O
kindergarten O
teachers O
. O

The O
rooms O
in O
Augartenstrasse B-LOC
were O
disinfected O
, O
freshly O
painted O
and O
the O
children B-TER
should O
have O
moved O
in O
within O
a O
few O
days O
. O

Then O
the O
caretaker O
called O
and O
said O
that O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
- O
after O
four O
months O
we O
got O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
year O
- O
long O
wish O
, O
a O
Jewish B-TER
infant I-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
, O
had O
thus O
come O
true O
. O

We O
adapted O
the O
house O
in O
the O
simplest O
and O
cheapest O
way O
and O
created O
a O
healthy O
environment O
for O
our O
little B-TER
ones I-TER
. O

Since O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
congregations O
’ O
offices O
, O
there O
had O
been O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
the O
welfare O
sector O
. O

People O
's O
earning O
potential O
declined O
, O
but O
housing O
and O
food O
had O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
. O

We O
tried O
to O
meet O
all O
these O
demands O
. O

In O
the O
field O
of O
youth O
welfare O
, O
a O
register O
was O
drawn O
up O
for O
all O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
parents B-TER
wanted O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

The O
registration O
form O
we O
worked O
out O
has O
been O
retained O
with O
very O
minor O
changes O
for O
the O
individual O
countries O
. O

Approximately O
10,000 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
. O

Spring O
and O
summer O
had O
come O
, O
but O
no O
possibility O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
our O
weakest O
children B-TER
. O

Gardens O
and O
parks O
were O
forbidden O
. O

The O
first O
country O
was O
Switzerland B-LOC
with O
the O
option O
to O
take O
100 O
children B-TER
for O
the O
summer O
, O
and O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
Norway B-LOC
with O
15 O
. O

The O
children B-TER
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
splendidly O
recovered O
, O
- O
5 O
- O
returned O
home O
in O
the O
fourth O
week O
, O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
children B-TER
stayed O
in O
Norway B-LOC
unless O
their O
parents B-TER
demanded O
their O
return O
. O

I O
also O
succeeded O
in O
finding O
sponsorships O
for O
our O
children B-TER
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
. O

In O
these O
cases O
Madame O
de O
Monier O
was O
especially O
helpful O
. O

- O
We O
tried O
to O
bring O
children B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
, O
but O
despite O
many O
offers O
of O
especially O
nice O
and O
gifted O
children B-TER
, O
we O
only O
succeeded O
here O
in O
very O
few O
cases O
. O

England B-LOC
and O
the O
other O
countries O
decided O
to O
start O
a O
generous O
children O
’s O
action O
only O
after O
November O
10 O
, O
1938 O
. O

This O
will O
be O
discussed O
elsewhere O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
Jewish B-TER
life I-TER
and O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
individual O
institutions B-TER
proceeded O
more O
or O
less O
excitingly O
. O

In O
the O
Kol O
- O
Nidre O
- O
Night O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
XVIII B-LOC
. I-LOC

and I-LOC
XIX I-LOC
. I-LOC

district I-LOC
had O
been O
given O
the O
order O
to O
vacate O
the O
apartments B-TER
respectively O
the O
houses B-TER
, O
and O
also O
our O
girl B-TER
orphanage I-TER
should O
be O
empty O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
last O
order O
, O
however O
, O
seemed O
inexecutable O
for O
that O
reason O
alone O
that O
we O
had O
since O
scarlet O
fever O
in O
the O
home B-TER
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
the O
efforts O
of O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Eichmann B-PER
to O
take O
countermeasures O
. O

In O
October O
, O
youths B-TER
from O
the O
apprentice B-TER
home I-TER
and O
the O
apprentice B-TER
girl I-TER
home I-TER
had O
been O
arrested B-TER
as O
part O
of O
a O
stateless B-TER
persons I-TER
action B-TER
. O

The O
congregation B-ORG
succeeded O
in O
bringing O
the O
youths B-TER
back O
to O
their O
homes B-TER
very O
soon O
. O

The O
house O
of O
the O
kindergarten B-TER
Wohlfahrt O
had O
been O
made O
available O
to O
the O
Youth B-ORG
Aliyah I-ORG
for O
their O
young B-TER
people I-TER
. O

About O
180 O
young B-TER
people I-TER
had O
their O
courses O
and O
meals O
in O
this O
house O
and O
were O
prepared O
there O
for O
the O
Aliyah B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
time O
a O
particularly O
intensive O
work O
began O
together O
with O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
a O
work O
which O
was O
animated O
by O
mutual O
trust O
and O
love O
for O
the O
youth B-TER
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
the O
House B-TER
of I-TER
Welfare I-TER
was O
requisitioned B-TER
by O
the O
Air O
- O
Raid O
Precaution O
. O

Smaller O
and O
bigger O
troubles O
were O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
, O
but O
we O
hoped O
to O
liquidate O
it O
in O
a O
quiet O
manner O
. O

So O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
1938 O
had O
come O
under O
many O
worries O
and O
that O
meant O
for O
the O
youth B-ORG
welfare I-ORG
the O
end O
of O
our O
day B-TER
care I-TER
center I-TER
in O
the O
Aspernbrückengasse B-LOC
, O
which O
was O
located O
opposite O
of O
the O
party O
house O
. O

- O
6 O
– O
Only O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
we O
were O
able O
to O
reopen O
it O
in O
the O
Mendel´sches B-TER
Stiftungshaus I-TER
in O
Denesgasse B-LOC
. O

They O
were O
able O
to O
remain O
there O
until O
November O
1939 O
, O
then O
they O
moved O
to O
the O
house O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
in O
Mohapelgasse B-LOC
. O

After O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
the O
foreign O
countries O
, O
especially O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
, O
where O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
stayed O
at O
that O
time O
and O
pointed O
out O
the O
great O
misery O
of O
our O
children O
, O
decided O
to O
intervene O
with O
generous O
active O
help O
. O

We O
received O
the O
order O
to O
complete O
the O
first O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
train I-ORG
. O

An O
organizational O
task O
that O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
days O
and O
nights O
without O
interruption O
and O
that O
had O
to O
work O
out O
in O
every O
detail O
. O

From O
the O
mass O
of O
registrations O
I O
suggested O
the O
children B-TER
whose O
departure B-TER
was O
most O
important O
for O
health O
, O
psychological O
and O
material O
reasons O
. O

We O
tested O
children B-TER
, O
they O
were O
examined O
by O
a O
physician B-TER
, O
passports B-TER
were O
obtained O
, O
luggage O
was O
prescribed O
and O
checked O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
meticulous O
work O
, O
which O
was O
indescribable O
, O
but O
necessary O
, O
so O
that O
on O
December O
10 O
, O
1938 O
about O
700 O
children B-TER
, O
including O
a O
third O
of O
racial B-TER
Jews I-TER
non O
- O
Aryan O
Christian O
, O
who O
had O
been O
selected O
by O
the O
Society B-TER
of I-TER
Friends I-TER
, O
could O
leave B-TER
. O

Many O
of O
these O
children B-TER
had O
lived O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
centers I-TER
near O
the O
synagogues B-TER
and O
the O
image O
of O
destruction B-TER
stood O
before O
their O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Many O
children B-TER
could O
say O
goodbye O
only O
to O
their O
mothers B-TER
because O
the O
fathers B-TER
were O
in O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
sight O
to O
see O
these O
seven O
hundred O
mothers B-TER
bid O
farewell O
to O
their O
children B-TER
at O
the O
terminus O
of O
the O
light O
rail O
in O
Hütteldorf B-LOC
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
enter O
the O
station O
building O
. O

The O
mood O
among O
the O
children B-TER
was O
one O
of O
joy O
and O
hope O
. O

They O
traveled B-TER
towards O
their O
happiness O
, O
believing O
that O
they O
could O
do O
something O
for O
their O
parents B-TER
from O
outside O
the O
country O
. O

In O
very O
isolated O
cases O
they O
succeeded O
. O

But O
these O
parents B-TER
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
flee B-TER
carefree O
across O
one O
of O
the O
nearest O
borders O
. O

We O
were O
supposed O
to O
put O
together O
another O
transport B-ORG
with O
1000 O
children B-TER
. O

However O
, O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

But O
we O
sent O
away O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
children B-TER
every O
month O
with O
English B-LOC
transports B-ORG
, O
which O
had O
been O
requested O
by O
friends O
and O
relatives B-TER
from O
England B-LOC
. O

In O
cases O
involving O
children B-TER
of O
- O
7 O
- O
stateless B-TER
and O
expellees O
, O
the O
committees B-TER
in O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
have O
been O
particularly O
kind O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Dutch B-LOC
committee B-TER
was O
extremely O
helpful O
, O
they O
took O
over O
our O
transports B-ORG
at O
the O
German B-LOC
border O
and O
led O
them O
to O
England B-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Geertruida B-PER
Wijsmuller I-PER
- I-PER
Meijer I-PER
Name O
in O
the O
original O
spaced O
out O
was O
also O
very O
helpful O
in O
some O
adoption B-TER
cases O
. O

Two O
groups O
of O
51 O
children B-TER
each O
were O
sent B-ORG
to O
France B-LOC
and O
from O
there O
were O
accommodated O
under O
particularly O
favourable O
conditions O
. O

Several O
groups O
went O
to O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
Sweden B-LOC
. O

A O
table O
gives O
information O
about O
the O
children B-TER
brought O
to O
emigration B-TER
by O
us O
. O

Only O
America B-LOC
did O
not O
take O
part O
in O
the O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
action I-ORG
in O
any O
way O
. O

We O
hoped O
that O
the O
Wagner O
- O
Bill O
would O
bring O
a O
solution O
to O
our O
whole O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
question O
. O

One O
day O
two O
Americans B-LOC
from O
Philadelphia B-LOC
appeared O
and O
told O
us O
the O
fairy O
tale O
that O
they O
had O
fifty O
affidavits O
with O
them O
and O
that O
in O
a O
short O
time O
, O
in O
about O
three O
weeks O
, O
they O
would O
travel B-TER
to O
America B-LOC
with O
fifty O
healthy O
and O
gifted O
Viennese B-LOC
children B-TER
. O

They O
contacted O
the O
American B-LOC
consul B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
an O
American B-LOC
physician B-TER
, O
examined O
the O
children B-TER
in O
detail O
, O
and O
so O
they O
traveled O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
confirmation O
and O
from O
there O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
to O
start O
their O
journey O
to O
America B-LOC
on O
the O
President O
Harding O
. O

Thus O
the O
summer O
of O
1939 O
had O
slowly O
approached O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
Probusgasse B-LOC
had O
long O
since O
been O
sold O
and O
was O
to O
be O
converted O
into O
a O
chocolate O
factory O
by O
the O
end O
of O
December O
at O
the O
latest O
. O

We O
still O
had O
a O
reprieve O
until O
then O
; O
until O
December O
, O
the O
children B-TER
were O
permitted O
to O
stay O
. O

There O
came O
the O
war O
, O
the O
house O
was O
occupied B-TER
by O
the O
air O
- O
raid O
, O
an O
air O
- O
raid O
unit O
first O
lived O
with O
our O
children B-TER
, O
but O
then O
the O
house O
had O
to O
be O
cleared O
within O
48 O
hours O
. O

We O
solved O
this O
unpleasant O
task O
, O
avoiding O
every O
disturbance O
, O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
children B-TER
concerned O
. O

The O
children B-TER
and O
the O
inventory O
went O
to O
the O
Merores B-TER
orphanage I-TER
and O
a O
group O
of O
15 O
older B-TER
boys I-TER
went O
to O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
. O

- O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
all O
departments O
of O
the O
Open B-ORG
Welfare I-ORG
had O
increased O
. O

The O
hardship O
forced O
almost O
all O
Jews B-TER
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
to O
claim O
welfare B-TER
. O

- O
8 O
- O
And O
very O
often O
we O
had O
to O
reencounter O
people O
among O
the O
clients O
who O
themselves O
had O
helped O
with O
full O
hands O
before O
the O
upheaval O
. O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
mention O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
help O
all O
of O
them O
, O
and O
especially O
these O
people O
, O
through O
every O
means O
at O
our O
disposal O
, O
to O
overcome O
the O
gravity O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

But O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
hours O
were O
the O
most O
difficult O
. O

Whether O
when O
we O
were O
commissioned O
by O
the O
authorities B-ORG
to O
put O
together O
Polish B-LOC
transports B-TER
and O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
unnecessary O
hardship O
, O
we O
supported O
Nazi O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
attempt O
to O
carry O
out O
Jewish O
colonization B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

- O
As O
the O
leader O
of O
such O
an O
investigation O
group O
, O
I O
had O
800 O
people O
to O
talk O
to O
or O
to O
reject O
in O
one O
afternoon O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
younger B-TER
male I-TER
population I-TER
had O
already O
emigrated B-TER
from O
Germany B-LOC
. O

Or O
was O
it O
sadder O
when O
a O
woman B-TER
came O
, O
still O
full O
of O
incomprehension O
for O
the O
tragedy O
of O
her O
fate O
, O
after O
receiving O
a O
telegram O
from O
the O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
informing O
her O
of O
the O
death O
of O
her O
husband B-TER
or O
son B-TER
. O

The O
most O
tragic O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
was O
when O
a O
fourteen O
- O
year O
- O
old O
girl B-TER
came O
to O
me O
to O
ask O
for O
her O
and O
her O
sister B-TER
to O
be O
accommodated O
in O
a O
home B-TER
. O

It O
does O
n’t O
have O
to O
be O
for O
long O
. O

We O
only O
want O
, O
when O
the O
urn O
of O
the O
father O
arrives O
, O
... O
and O
she O
put O
a O
telegram O
on O
my O
desk O
, O
which O
she O
had O
intercepted O
so O
that O
the O
severely O
neuropathic O
mother B-TER
would O
not O
get O
her O
hands O
on O
it O
, O
we O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
funeral O
of O
our O
father O
and O
sit O
Shiva O
, O
without O
mother O
knowing O
. O

This O
father B-TER
, O
like O
so O
many O
others O
, O
was O
a O
victim O
of O
the O
days O
of O
November B-TER
1939 I-TER
. O

In O
February O
1940 O
, O
the O
first O
fruits O
of O
an O
American B-LOC
campaign O
regarding O
the O
emigration B-ORG

After O

we O
had O
been O
commissioned O

The O

not O
sufficient O
to O

under O
Hitler B-PER
. O

( O
1938 O
– O
1940 O
) O
From O
time O
immemorial O
, O
the O
Viennese B-LOC
Jews O
had O
been O
frightened O
by O
the O
12th O
of O
March O
. O

On O
this O
day O
, O
in O
1621 O
, O
on O
the O
orders O
of O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
duke O
named O
Albrecht O
, O
all O
Jews B-TER
with O
their O
wives B-TER
and O
children B-TER
died B-TER
by I-TER
fire I-TER
on O
the O
Erdberg O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
that O
the O
Jews O
refused O
to O
be O
baptized B-TER
. O

The O
chronicler O
immortalized O
this O
duke O
in O
the O
saying O
: O
I O
warred O
against O
the O
Turks O
, O
I O
surrounded O
Tabor O
, O
but O
I O
had O
my O
Jews O
burned O
before O
. O

Shortly O
after O
this O
Viennese B-LOC
catastrophe B-TER
, O
the O
Duke O
received O
the O
crown O
of O
Germany B-LOC
for O
a O
short O
time O
after O
the O
death O
of O
Emperor O
Sigismund O
. O

The O
Jews O
feared O
that O
they O
would O
suffer O
the O
same O
fate O
under O
his O
rule O
in O
Germany B-LOC
as O
well O
, O
but O
fortunately O
this O
villain O
died O
after O
two O
years O
. O

It O
is O
characteristic O
that O
this O
god O
- O
fearing O
Austrian B-LOC
had O
the O
Augsburg B-LOC
City O
Council O
buy O
from O
him O
the O
right O
to O
expel O
the O
Jews O
from O
Augsburg B-LOC
for O
9,000 O
guilders O
and O
to O
confiscate B-TER
all O
their O
possessions O
. O

I O
mention O
this O
period O
of O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Austrian B-LOC
Jews O
for O
two O
reasons O
: O
because O
of O
the O
indescribable O
steadfastness O
of O
our O
fathers O
, O
who O
preferred O
to O
be O
burned O
rather O
than O
to O
deny O
their O
Judaism B-TER
, O
and O
secondly O
because O
of O
the O
event O
that O
Germany B-LOC
had O
already O
once O
been O
happy O
with O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
who O
wanted O
to O
exterminate B-TER
us O
Jews O
, O
and O
for O
another O
reason O
, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
guiding O
principle O
of O
all O
history O
, O
that O
antisemitism B-TER
in O
Austria B-LOC
had O
been O
planted O
for O
years O
deep O
in O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
people O
. O

So O
on O
12 O
March O
1938 O
, O
the O
vanguard O
of O
the O
German B-TER
military I-TER
came O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

On O
Sunday O
our O
congregation B-ORG
opened O
its O
offices O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
. O

From O
a O
superficial O
point O
of O
view O
there O
was O
almost O
no O
change O
to O
be O
felt O
. O

Around O
noon O
, O
the O
chairman O
of O
our O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
department O
appeared O
and O
informed O
us O
that O
the O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
outpatient I-TER
clinic I-TER
in O
Rauscherstrasse B-LOC
had O
been O
occupied O
. O

These O
buildings O
, O
which O
are O
particularly O
important O
for O
us O
in O
regard O
of O
our O
children B-TER
at I-TER
risk I-TER
to O
health O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
get O
free O
immediately O
. O

The O
individual O
clients O
came O
only O
after O
3 O
or O
4 O
days O
and O
complained O
about O
hardships O
by O
neighbours O
or O
people O
in O
the O
immediate O
vicinity O
. O

Wednesday O
, O
the O
16th O
, O
someone O
from O
the O
so O
- O
called O
authority B-ORG
came O
to O
the O
congregation B-ORG
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

They O
checked O
bookkeeping O
, O
accounting O
, O
requisitioned O
typewriters O
, O
adding O
- O
machines O
, O
and O
recorded O
the O
state O
of O
the O
cash O
register O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
Youth B-TER
Welfare I-TER
Service I-TER
was O
already O
cooperating O
with O
the O
General B-TER
Welfare I-TER
Service I-TER
. O

The O
clients O
were O
no O
longer O
dealt O
with O
on O
file O
, O
but O
in O
the O
antechambers O
of O
the O
welfare O
centre O
, O
which O
had O
been O
turned O
into O
one O
room O
, O
the O
requests O
of O
clients O
asking O
for O
support O
were O
quickly O
registered O
in O
files B-TER
, O
filled O
in O
with O
only O
the O
most O
necessary O
data O
, O
and O
each O
- O
12 O
- O
applicant O
received O
a O
few O
shillings O
so O
that O
he O
could O
buy O
bread B-TER
for O
himself O
and O
his O
family B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
we O
worked O
– O
undisturbed O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
of O
speaking O
- O
until O
Friday O
9 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Then O
the O
house O
was O
occupied O
by O
the O
Secret B-ORG
State I-ORG
Police I-ORG
, O
the O
individual O
offices O
were O
searched O
, O
desks O
and O
files O
were O
examined O
: O
the O
clients O
making O
requests O
- O
their O
number O
was O
in O
the O
hundreds O
- O
were O
photographed B-TER
together O
with O
us O
officials O
. O

At O
10 O
a.m. O
, O
the O
telephone O
line O
stopped O
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
took O
over O
the O
house O
telephone O
. O

The O
rumor O
had O
quietly O
reached O
us O
that O
the O
presidium B-ORG
and O
the O
office B-ORG
directorate I-ORG
were O
under O
the O
strictest O
surveillance B-TER
. O

The O
eviction O
order O
came O
at O
12 O
noon O
. O

With O
all O
the O
tragedy O
, O
strange O
scenes O
took O
place O
here O
too O
. O

Our O
cashier B-ORG
, O
who O
was O
cross O
- O
examined O
from O
morning O
until O
noon O
, O
was O
finally O
sent O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O

Not O
knowing O
what O
he O
was O
saying O
, O
he O
turned O
around O
at O
the O
door O
and O
said O
, O
Would O
the O
gentlemen O
like O
some O
more O
information O
? O
This O
naive O
question O
cost O
him O
7 O
weeks O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

From O
that O
day O
on O
, O
the O
congregation B-ORG
was O
closed O
for O
about O
5 O
weeks O
. O

We O
leading O
officials B-ORG
met O
daily O
in O
a O
little O
Tschoch O
( O
café O
) O
and O
- O
when O
this O
was O
closed O
- O
in O
a O
Jewish B-TER
café I-TER
. O

We O
had O
breakfast B-TER
there O
, O
met O
by O
chance O
, O
and O
in O
this O
way O
we O
communicated O
with O
each O
other O
, O
as O
it O
was O
also O
forbidden O
to O
meet O
in O
the O
apartments O
. O

The O
operation O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
homes I-TER
continued O
. O

We O
were O
anxious O
to O
provide O
the O
homes B-TER
with O
the O
necessities O
, O
both O
materially O
and O
in O
terms O
of O
victuals B-TER
. O

I O
relieved O
them O
of O
their O
dealings O
with O
the O
various O
authorities B-ORG
in O
order O
to O
relieve O
them O
of O
the O
inconvenience O
and O
to O
make O
things O
easier O
for O
the O
wardens O
, O
who O
were O
well O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
their O
educational O
duties O
but O
were O
unable O
to O
communicate O
properly O
with O
the O
changed O
authorities B-ORG
. O

The O
money O
to O
run O
the O
homes B-TER
we O
took O
from O
the O
only O
office O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
congregation B-ORG
, O
the O
cemetery B-ORG
office I-ORG
, O
since O
we O
were O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
destitute O
. O

After O
the O
house O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
was O
closed O
, O
the O
cemetery B-ORG
office I-ORG
was O
located O
in O
a O
laundry O
shop O
diagonally O
opposite O
, O
until O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
community B-ORG
. O

After O
a O
few O
days O
the O
representatives O
of O
JOINT B-ORG
came O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
and O
provided O
us O
with O
the O
necessary O
means O
. O

The O
first O
house O
occupied O
by O
the O
National O
Socialists O
was O
the O
apprentice B-TER
home I-TER
for I-TER
girls I-TER
. O

But O
we O
soon O
managed O
to O
bring O
some O
of O
the O
girls B-TER
back O
to O
the O
home O
. O

Particular O
difficulties O
arose O
in O
the O
13th O
district O
in O
a O
home B-TER
for O
abandoned O
Jewish O
girls B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
strictly O
Jewish O
homes B-TER
, O
there O
was O
an O
interdenominational O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
in O
Vienna B-LOC
in O
the O
19th B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
a O
foundation O
of O
Baroness O
Wertheimstein O
for O
children B-TER
of O
all O
denominations O
. O

This O
home B-TER
was O
given O
to O
us O
one O
day O
by O
the O
magistrate B-ORG
, O
to O
which O
we O
had O
good O
relations O
- O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
change O
of O
flags O
- O
as O
a O
Jewish B-TER
home I-TER
. O

Aryan B-TER
- O
13 O
- O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
accommodated O
elsewhere O
immediately O
. O

24 O
hours O
after O
this O
announcement O
, O
the O
director O
of O
the O
house O
informed O
me O
that O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
by O
the O
National B-ORG
Socialist I-ORG
Women I-ORG
’s I-ORG
Party I-ORG
and O
that O
all O
Jewish O
children B-TER
were O
to O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
evening O
. O

I O
immediately O
drove O
out O
to O
the O
home B-TER
and O
tried O
to O
get O
the O
deadline O
extended O
, O
as O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
accommodate O
infants B-TER
and O
toddlers B-TER
in O
one O
place O
with O
schoolchildren B-TER
. O

With O
difficulty O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
24 O
- O
hour O
postponement O
. O

The O
Jewish O
owners O
of O
villas B-TER
, O
some O
of O
which O
were O
occupied O
, O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
make O
them O
available O
to O
us O
so O
as O
not O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves O
. O

So O
the O
only O
solution O
we O
had O
was O
to O
occupy O
the O
infirmary O
of O
the O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
, O
a O
temporary O
solution O
, O
and O
we O
prayed O
that O
no O
child B-TER
would O
fall O
ill B-TER
there O
within O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

We O
therefore O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
roof O
for O
our O
children B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

When O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
was O
reopened O
, O
we O
immediately O
tried O
to O
free O
a O
foundation O
house O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O

The O
house B-TER
belonging O
to O
the O
Theresien B-TER
- I-TER
Kreuzer I-TER
- I-TER
Verein I-TER
, O
a O
foundation O
from O
1847 O
in O
Untere B-LOC
Augartenstrasse I-LOC
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
most O
suitable O
and O
the O
least O
investment O
- O
needy O
. O

We O
had O
bought O
furniture O
from O
emigrating O
kindergarten O
teachers O
, O
had O
received O
gifts O
, O
the O
rooms O
of O
the O
house O
were O
disinfected O
and O
freshly O
painted O
and O
in O
a O
few O
days O
the O
children B-TER
should O
have O
moved O
in O
. O

Then O
the O
home O
caretaker O
telephoned O
: O
the O
home B-TER
had O
been O
occupied O
. O

After O
4 O
months O
we O
got O
it O
back O
. O

Our O
year O
- O
long O
wish O
to O
own O
a O
Jewish O
infant B-TER
and I-TER
toddler I-TER
home I-TER
had O
thus O
come O
true O
. O

We O
have O
adapted O
the O
home B-TER
in O
the O
simplest O
and O
cheapest O
way O
possible O
to O
create O
a O
healthy O
environment O
for O
our O
little B-TER
ones I-TER
. O

The O
negotiations O
for O
epidemic B-TER
hospitals I-TER
were O
conducted O
with O
a O
body O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
unknown O
to O
German B-LOC
Jews O
, O
namely O
the O
Stillhaltekommissär O
( O
liquidation O
commissar O
) O
. O

I O
hardly O
knew O
more O
about O
this O
institution O
than O
you O
did O
when O
one O
day O
I O
received O
a O
summons O
to O
our O
Foundation B-ORG
House I-ORG
on O
the O
Schottenring B-LOC
, O
a O
house O
in O
which O
we O
often O
had O
beautiful O
and O
cheerful O
meetings O
of O
the O
WIZO B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
same O
room O
, O
a O
man O
was O
now O
sitting O
plain O
- O
clothed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
the O
liquidation O
commissar O
. O

He O
claimed O
that O
the O
emigration B-ORG
of I-ORG
children I-ORG
proceeded O
far O
too O
slow O
for O
them O
. O

Since O
we O
had O
not O
yet O
sent O
a O
single O
child B-TER
away O
, O
I O
could O
only O
agree O
with O
this O
accusation O
, O
but O
I O
made O
it O
so O
clear O
to O
him O
that O
our O
children B-TER
were O
willing O
to O
leave O
immediately O
if O
they O
had O
an O
entry O
permit O
, O
that O
he O
never O
wanted O
to O
talk O
to O
me O
again O
. O

I O
only O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
him O
by O
telephone O
a O
few O
more O
times O
, O
and O
then O
we O
agreed O
quickly O
. O

Since O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
, O
client O
traffic O
in O
the O
welfare B-TER
sector O
continued O
in O
a O
more O
intensive O
manner O
. O

- O
14 O
- O
We O
tried O
to O
meet O
the O
demands O
of O
the O
applicants O
. O

The O
income B-TER
opportunities O
of O
the O
people O
worsened O
, O
but O
apartments B-TER
and O
food B-TER
had O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
. O

A O
register O
was O
established O
in O
the O
youth B-TER
welfare I-TER
service O
for O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
parents B-TER
wanted O
them O
to O
emigrate B-TER
. O

The O
registration O
form O
we O
worked O
out O
at O
the O
time O
has O
been O
retained O
for O
the O
individual O
countries O
, O
with O
very O
insignificant O
changes O
. O

Approximately O
10,000 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
. O

Spring O
came O
and O
the O
time O
when O
we O
usually O
would O
make O
arrangements O
for O
our O
children O
to O
send O
them O
to O
the O
countryside O
. O

We O
looked O
for O
opportunities O
to O
emigrate B-TER
, O
we O
looked O
for O
summer O
places O
and O
found O
100 O
in O
Switzerland B-LOC
and O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
15 O
in O
Norway B-LOC
. O

The O
Swiss B-LOC
children B-TER
came O
back O
on O
time O
. O

We O
only O
got O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
French O
- O
speaking O
part O
of O
Switzerland B-LOC
by O
founding O
sponsorships O
, O
the O
OSE B-ORG
was O
particularly O
helpful O
in O
these O
cases O
. O

From O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
children B-TER
, O
however O
, O
we O
never O
heard O
again O
, O
i.e. O
we O
often O
received O
reports O
from O
them O
, O
but O
their O
addresses O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
determined O
, O
and O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
consulate B-TER
asked O
me O
every O
14 O
days O
to O
finally O
bring O
the O
children B-TER
back O
to O
Vienna B-LOC
since O
the O
Norwegian B-LOC
authorities O
could O
not O
locate O
them O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
to O
bring O
children B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
, O
which O
despite O
many O
offers O
of O
particularly O
nice O
and O
gifted O
children B-TER
was O
only O
possible O
in O
very O
few O
cases O
. O

Only O
after O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
did O
a O
more O
comprehensive O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
campaign I-ORG
take O
place O
. O

But O
this O
will O
be O
mentioned O
elsewhere O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
life I-TER
and O
the O
continuation O
of O
the O
individual O
institutions O
was O
more O
or O
less O
exciting O
. O

In O
the O
Kol O
- O
Nidre O
Night O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
18th B-LOC
and I-LOC
19th I-LOC
districts I-LOC
had O
been O
given O
the O
order O
to O
clear O
the O
apartments B-TER
and O
houses B-TER
respectively O
, O
and O
also O
our O
girls B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
should O
be O
empty O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
last O
order O
, O
however O
, O
seemed O
impracticable O
due O
to O
a O
scarlet B-TER
fever I-TER
quarantine O
that O
I O
had O
stretched O
out O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
the O
efforts O
of O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
had O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
Hauptsturmführer B-TER
Eichmann B-PER
to O
take O
countermeasures O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
enjoy O
various O
smaller O
and O
larger O
skirmishes O
. O

The O
great O
synagogue B-TER
in O
Leopoldstadt B-LOC
had O
been O
destroyed B-TER
by O
a O
firebrand O
, O
old O
and O
noble O
Jews O
had O
to O
stand O
with O
billboards O
Do O
n’t O
buy O
from O
Jews O
in O
front O
of O
the O
shops O
. O

The O
library O
of O
the O
Rabbinical B-ORG
Seminary I-ORG
had O
already O
been O
confiscated B-TER
, O
and O
the O
same O
fate O
threatened O
the O
community B-ORG
library I-ORG
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
- O
15 O
- O
stateless B-TER
persons I-TER
action O
, O
young B-TER
people I-TER
from O
our O
apprentice B-TER
’s I-TER
home I-TER
and O
from O
the O
apprentice B-TER
girls I-TER
’ I-TER
home I-TER
were O
arrested B-TER
; O
however O
, O
we O
succeeded O
in O
bringing O
the O
children B-TER
back O
to O
the O
homes B-TER
soon O
. O

Following O
a O
suggestion O
by O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
, O
the O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
had O
meanwhile O
been O
founded O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
elaborate O
plan O
drawn O
up O
by O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
. O

Its O
purpose O
was O
to O
make O
it O
possible O
for O
people O
who O
were O
trying O
to O
emigrate B-TER
to O
obtain O
a O
passport B-TER
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
first O
confirmation O
had O
lost O
its O
validity O
until O
the O
last O
had O
been O
reached O
. O

In O
the O
house O
of O
the O
kindergarten B-TER
Wohlfahrt O
, O
rooms O
were O
made O
available O
for O
the O
Youth B-ORG
Aliyah I-ORG
. O

There O
about O
100 O
young B-TER
people I-TER
had O
their O
courses O
and O
meals B-TER
and O
were O
prepared O
for O
the O
Aliyah B-ORG
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
started O
a O
particularly O
intensive O
work O
together O
with O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
a O
work O
which O
was O
inspired O
by O
mutual O
trust O
and O
by O
love O
for O
the O
young B-TER
people I-TER
. O

November O
10th O
had O
come O
with O
many O
worries O
. O

And O
for O
the O
Youth B-TER
Welfare I-TER
this O
meant O
the O
end O
of O
our O
day B-TER
care I-TER
center I-TER
, O
which O
was O
located O
opposite O
the O
Brown O
House O
, O
and O
which O
could O
only O
be O
reopened O
several O
weeks O
later O
in O
another O
foundation B-TER
house I-TER
. O

After O
November O
10th O
, O
the O
foreign O
countries O
, O
especially O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
, O
where O
Dr. O
Loewenherz B-PER
and O
Dr. O
Rothenberg B-PER
were O
at O
that O
time O
, O
intervened O
with O
generous O
and O
active O
assistance O
. O

We O
were O
given O
the O
task O
to O
arrange O
the O
first O
children B-ORG
’s I-ORG
train I-ORG
, O
an O
organizational O
task O
that O
forced O
us O
to O
work O
for O
days O
and O
nights O
without O
interruption O
, O
and O
which O
had O
to O
work O
out O
in O
every O
detail O
. O

From O
the O
mass O
of O
registrations O
I O
suggested O
those O
children B-TER
whose O
departure B-TER
was O
most O
important O
for O
health O
, O
psychological O
and O
material O
reasons O
. O

We O
checked O
the O
children B-TER
, O
they O
were O
examined O
by O
a O
physician B-TER
, O
passports B-TER
were O
obtained O
, O
luggage O
prescribed O
and O
checked O
, O
an O
indescribable O
amount O
of O
meticulous O
work O
, O
which O
was O
necessary O
, O
however O
, O
so O
that O
on O
10 O
December O
1938 O
ca O
. O

700 O
children B-TER
could O
leave O
, O
among O
them O
1/3 O
racial B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
who O
had O
been O
selected O
by O
the O
Society B-ORG
of I-ORG
Friends I-ORG
. O

Many O
of O
these O
children B-TER
had O
lived O
in O
the O
Jewish B-TER
centers I-TER
, O
and O
the O
image O
of O
destruction O
stood O
before O
their O
frightened O
eyes O
. O

Many O
children B-TER
could O
say O
goodbye O
only O
to O
their O
mothers B-TER
, O
as O
the O
fathers B-TER
were O
in O
the O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
horrible O
sight O
when O
these O
700 O
mothers B-TER
said O
goodbye O
to O
their O
children B-TER
at O
the O
Hütteldorf B-LOC
terminus O
of O
the O
light O
rail O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
were O
not O
permitted O
to O
enter O
the O
station O
building O
. O

The O
mood O
of O
these O
children B-TER
was O
one O
of O
joy O
and O
hope O
. O

They O
traveled B-TER
towards O
their O
happiness O
with O
the O
belief O
that O
they O
could O
do O
something O
for O
their O
parents B-TER
from O
outside O
of O
the O
country O
. O

In O
a O
few O
stray O
cases O
they O
succeeded O
. O

However O
, O
the O
parents B-TER
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
flee B-TER
across O
one O
of O
the O
nearest O
borders O
without O
worrying O
. O

After O
this O
transport B-ORG
, O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
arrange O
another O
one O
with O
1000 O
children B-TER
. O

But O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
. O

Every O
month O
, O
we O
handled O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
children B-TER
for O
English B-LOC
transports B-ORG
, O
who O
- O
16 O
– O
had O
been O
requested O
for O
England B-ORG
by O
friends O
and O
relatives B-TER
. O

In O
cases O
involving O
the O
children B-TER
of O
expellees O
and O
stateless B-TER
persons O
, O
the O
committees B-TER
in O
England B-LOC
and O
Holland B-LOC
were O
particularly O
kind O
to O
us O
. O

The O
Dutch B-LOC
children B-TER
’s I-TER
committee B-TER
in O
particular O
was O
extremely O
helpful O
and O
took O
over O
our O
transports O
at O
the O
German B-LOC
border O
and O
guided O
them O
as O
far O
as O
England B-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Geertruida B-PER
Wijsmuller I-PER
- I-PER
Meijer I-PER
was O
also O
very O
helpful O
in O
some O
adoption B-TER
cases O
. O

Two O
groups O
of O
51 O
children B-TER
each O
were O
sent O
to O
France B-LOC
and O
accommodated O
under O
particularly O
favourable O
conditions O
. O

Some O
groups O
went O
to O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
Sweden B-LOC
, O
only O
America B-LOC
did O
not O
participate O
in O
the O
children B-TER
's O
action O
in O
any O
way O
. O

We O
hoped O
that O
the O
Wagner O
Bill O
would O
bring O
a O
solution O
to O
our O
whole O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
question O
. O

Then O
one O
day O
two O
Americans B-LOC
from O
Philadelphia B-LOC
appeared O
and O
told O
us O
the O
fairy O
tale O
that O
they O
had O
50 O
free O
affidavits O
with O
them O
and O
that O
in O
a O
short O
time O
, O
about O
3 O
weeks O
, O
they O
planned O
to O
travel O
to O
America B-LOC
with O
50 O
healthy O
and O
gifted O
Viennese B-LOC
children B-TER
. O

They O
contacted O
the O
American B-LOC
consulate B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
, O
an O
American B-LOC
physician B-TER
, O
examined O
the O
children B-TER
in O
detail O
- O
and O
then O
they O
travelled O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
for O
confirmation O
and O
from O
there O
to O
Hamburg B-LOC
to O
start O
their O
journey O
to O
America B-LOC
on O
the O
ship O
President O
Harding O
. O

So O
the O
summer O
of O
1939 O
had O
slowly O
approached O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
’ I-TER
orphanage I-TER
in O
Probusgasse B-LOC
had O
long O
since O
been O
sold O
and O
was O
to O
be O
converted O
into O
a O
chocolate O
factory B-TER
at O
the O
end O
of O
December O
. O

Then O
came O
the O
war B-TER
, O
the O
house B-TER
was O
occupied O
by O
air B-TER
- I-TER
raid I-TER
protection O
, O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
first O
group O
lived O
together O
with O
our O
children B-TER
, O
then O
the O
house B-TER
had O
to O
be O
cleared O
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

We O
solved O
this O
unpleasant O
task O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
for O
the O
affected O
children B-TER
, O
avoiding O
any O
kind O
of O
attention O
. O

Children B-TER
and O
inventory O
were O
moved O
to O
the O
Merores B-TER
Orphanage I-TER
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
number O
of O
clients O
in O
all O
departments O
of O
welfare B-TER
had O
increased O
. O

The O
need O
forced O
almost O
all O
Jews O
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
to O
call O
on O
the O
services O
of O
the O
welfare B-TER
office O
, O
and O
we O
very O
often O
had O
to O
reencounter O
people O
among O
the O
clients O
who O
themselves O
had O
helped O
with O
full O
hands O
before O
the O
change O
. O

It O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
mention O
that O
we O
tried O
to O
help O
everyone O
- O
and O
especially O
these O
people O
- O
with O
all O
means O
at O
our O
disposal O
to O
overcome O
the O
hardships O
of O
the O
moment O
. O

But O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
which O
hours O
were O
the O
most O
difficult O
. O

Whether O
when O
we O
were O
commissioned O
by O
the O
authorities B-ORG
to O
put O
together O
Polish B-LOC
transports B-TER
and O
, O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
unnecessary O
hardship O
, O
we O
supported O
Nazi O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
attempt O
to O
carry O
out O
Jewish O
colonization B-TER
in O
Poland B-LOC
. O

- O
As O
the O
leader O
of O
such O
an O
investigation O
group O
, O
I O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
800 O
people O
in O
one O
afternoon O
in O
my O
office O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
became O
apparent O
- O
17 O
- O
that O
younger B-TER
male I-TER
population I-TER
had O
already O
completely O
migrated B-TER
from O
Austria B-LOC
. O

On O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Jewish B-ORG
community I-ORG
and O
the O
Palestine B-ORG
Office I-ORG
, O
4 O
people O
had O
been O
sent O
to O
Poland B-LOC
by O
the O
Central B-ORG
Office I-ORG
for I-ORG
Jewish I-ORG
Emigration I-ORG
, O
who O
inspected O
the O
area O
where O
this O
Jewish B-TER
colonization I-TER
was O
to O
take O
place O
. O

They O
came O
back O
quite O
empty O
- O
handed O
because O
the O
military B-TER
authorities I-TER
had O
enough O
to O
do O
with O
the O
population O
of O
the O
country O
after O
the O
lost O
Polish B-LOC
war O
and O
were O
not O
willing O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jewish B-LOC
question I-LOC
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
there O
was O
another O
Polish O
Action O
, O
and O
1,100 O
people O
were O
snatched O
, O
some O
of O
them O
from O
the O
old B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
homes I-TER
that O
existed O
now O
in O
the O
various O
former O
youth B-TER
homes I-TER
, O
and O
sent O
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1939 O
/ O
40 O
, O
35,000 O
people O
were O
fed B-TER
in O
15 O
places O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
about O
40 O
- O
45,000 O
Jews B-TER
were O
still O
living O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
. O

These O
are O
the O
last O
figures O
that O
were O
available O
to O
me O
on O
the O
12th O
of O
March O
1940 O
, O
the O
day O
of O
my O
emigration B-TER
. O

It O
was O
at O
this O
time O
that O
America B-LOC
began O
to O
react O
to O
our O
applications O
, O
which O
numbered O
many O
hundreds O
, O
and O
I O
almost O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
a O
farewell O
gift O
that O
we O
received O
the O
first O
permit O
, O
albeit O
for O
only O
a O
few O
children B-TER
, O
to O
emigrate B-ORG
to O
America B-LOC
in O
those O
days O
. O
