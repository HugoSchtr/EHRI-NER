The O
Department B-ORG
is O
already O
aware O
that O
the O
military B-TER
occupation I-TER
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bucovina B-LOC
was O
followed O
by O
the O
establishment B-TER
of I-TER
Jews I-TER
in I-TER
ghettos I-TER
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
and O
that O
large O
numbers O
, O
particularly O
from O
Bessarabia B-LOC
, O
were O
gradually O
evacuated B-TER
into O
the O
territory O
lying O
beyond O
the O
Dniester B-LOC
River I-LOC
. O

These O
measures B-TER
were O
carried O
out O
under O
appalling O
conditions O
and O
accompanied O
by O
innumerable O
kinds O
of O
frightfulness O
, O
including O
robbery B-TER
, O
starvation B-TER
, O
killings B-TER
and O
other O
brutalities O
. O

Only O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
Jews B-TER
are O
believed O
now O
to O
be O
left O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
– O
estimates O
vary O
from O
ten O
to O
thirty O
thousand O
out O
of O
a O
total O
of O
just O
over O
two O
hundred O
thousand O
residing O
there O
prior O
to O
the O
Russian B-TER
seizure I-TER
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
in O
June O
1940 O
– O
while O
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
there O
are O
, O
according O
to O
reliable O
Jews B-TER
, O
some O
fifteen O
to O
twenty O
thousand O
Jews B-TER
now O
awaiting O
deportation B-TER
eastward O
to O
Transnistria B-LOC
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
. O

A O
great O
many O
, O
undoubtedly O
tens O
of O
thousands O
, O
have O
already O
been O
thus O
evacuated B-TER
. O

During O
the O
past O
three O
weeks O
evidence O
has O
been O
accumulating O
– O
first O
in O
the O
form O
of O
vague O
rumors B-TER
and O
unconfirmed O
reports O
, O
then O
through O
increasingly O
substantial O
sources O
of O
information O
and O
finally O
in O
exchange O
of O
letters B-TER
between O
Marshal O
Antonescu B-PER
and O
the O
head B-TER
of O
the O
local O
Jewish B-TER
community I-TER
– O
that O
such O
as O
remains O
of O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
and O
Bessarabia B-LOC
is O
being O
evacuated B-TER
eastward O
into O
the O
war O
- O
devastated O
territory O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
under O
conditions O
so O
appalling O
that O
they O
would O
seem O
to O
afford O
a O
substantial O
share O
of O
the O
evacuees B-TER
little O
chance O
to O
survive B-TER
. O

Persistent O
reports O
have O
reached O
me O
daily O
regarding O
these O
unfortunate O
people B-TER
– O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
, O
including O
the O
old O
and O
ill O
– O
who O
, O
given O
only O
a O
few O
hours O
notice O
with O
the O
right O
to O
take O
with O
them O
only O
a O
meager O
ten O
kilograms O
of O
belongings B-TER
and O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O
dollars O
in O
money O
– O
the O
stories B-TER
almost O
invariably O
add O
that O
these O
belongings B-TER
and O
the O
money O
are O
taken O
from O
them O
en O
route O
– O
have O
been O
herded O
eastward O
on O
foot O
or O
in O
carts O
or O
box O
- O
cars O
, O
to O
war O
- O
swept O
regions O
where O
buildings O
have O
been O
razed O
and O
food B-TER
and O
other O
supplies B-TER
destroyed O
or O
removed O
and O
where O
winter O
weather O
will O
soon O
prevail O
. O

This O
modern O
Captivity B-TER
would O
seem O
deliberately O
calculated O
to O
serve O
a O
program O
of O
virtual O
extermination B-TER
and O
, O
even O
if O
the O
persistent O
rumors B-TER
that O
the O
evacuees B-TER
in O
numberless O
cases O
are O
plundered B-TER
of O
their O
belongings B-TER
, O
that O
dozens O
and O
hundreds O
are O
shot B-TER
en O
route O
, O
pushed O
off O
bridges O
or O
dead O
of O
exhaustion O
, O
are O
greatly O
exaggerated O
or O
untrue O
, O
it O
seems O
certain O
that O
many O
thousands O
will O
perish O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
as O
suggested O
in O
the O
last O
paragraph O
of O
my O
telegram O
first O
cited O
above O
, O
many O
of O
these O
reports O
and O
rumors B-TER
are O
unconfirmed O
and O
must O
be O
classified O
as O
hearsay O
, O
or O
even O
propaganda B-TER
by O
interested O
persons O
[ O
... O
] O
but O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
say O
that O
even O
the O
minimum O
of O
truth O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
lies O
in O
these O
stories B-TER
is O
sufficient O
to O
give O
grave O
concern B-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
civilized I-TER
world I-TER
. O
