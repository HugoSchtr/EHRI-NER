Resident O

Refoel B-PER
Kirshenblum I-PER
tells O
: O
I O
was O
born O
in O
Lublin B-LOC
in O
1905 O
to O
religious O
parents B-TER
. O

I O
am O
trained O
as O
a O
builder O
, O
but O
during O
the O
occupation B-TER
I O
had O
different O
jobs O
: O
loaded O
timber O
on O
the O
railway O
, O
took O
out O
rubbish O
and O
mixed O
concrete O
. O

I O
married O
in O
1928 O
, O
my O
wife B-TER
and O
three O
children B-TER
perished B-TER
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
on O
the O
10th O
of O
November O
1942 O
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
I O
lost O
my O
father B-TER
, O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
my O
brother B-TER
with O
his O
wife B-TER
and O
child B-TER
. O

Since O
1928 O
, O
I O
live O
in O
the O
town O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
, O
Bielsk B-LOC
district O
, O
voivodeship O
of O
Bialystok B-LOC
. O

Around O
5000 O
Jews O
lived O
in O
the O
town O
, O
that O
is O
, O
66 O
percent O
of O
the O
total O
population O
. O

Most O
Jews O
worked O
in O
the O
industry O
of O
ceramics O
, O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
of O
accessories O
for O
shoemakers O
and O
in O
shoemakers O
’ O
and O
tailors O
’ O
workshops O
. O

There O
were O
also O
lots O
of O
artisans O
who O
worked O
at O
home O
and O
small O
shopkeepers O
. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
encirclement O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
2nd O
of O
November O
1942 O
, O
around O
300 O
Jews O
from O
surrounding O
towns O
and O
villages O
were O
driven O
to O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
. O

Because O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
was O
a O
border O
town O
, O
right O
near O
the O
Bug B-LOC
river I-LOC
, O
the O
was O
no O
possibility O
to O
escape O
to O
Russia B-LOC
, O
the O
town O
had O
been O
taken O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
already O
at O
dawn O
of O
the O
23rd O
of O
June O
1941 O
. O

In O
the O
ghetto B-TER
that O
had O
been O
created O
every O
day O
about O
ten O
Jews O
would O
die B-TER
, O
and O
there O
were O
no O
births O
. O

There O
were O
a O
few O
cases O
of O
mental O
illness B-TER
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
German B-TER
occupation I-TER
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
forced O
the O
whole O
Jewish O
population O
( O
including O
women B-TER
, O
children B-TER
and O
the O
elderly O
) O
to O
remove O
grass O
from O
stones O
by O
their O
bare O
hands O
and O
shot B-TER
three O
Jews O
, O
because O
it O
appeared O
to O
the O
German B-TER
overseers B-TER
that O
they O
were O
not O
going O
to O
work O
with O
enough O
enthusiasm O
. O

We O
were O
soon O
obliged O
to O
wear O
yellow B-TER
patches I-TER
. O

The O
local O
residents O
together O
with O
a O
few O
Germans B-TER
from O
Organisation B-ORG
Todt I-ORG
, O
that O
had O
just O
arrived O
, O
decided O
to O
bury O
the O
beautiful O
Lenin B-PER
monument O
that O
stood O
in O
the O
marketplace O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
. O

The O
whole O
Jewish O
population O
was O
dragged O
out O
to O
participate O
in O
this O
shameful O
activity O
and O
people O
were O
beaten O
extremely O
cruelly O
. O

One O
Jew O
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
river O
while O
still O
alive O
, O
and O
he O
perished B-TER
. O

[ O
Another O
one O
] O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
Torah B-TER
crown O
and O
a O
tallit B-TER
and O
forced O
to O
hold O
a O
eulogy O
to O
Lenin B-PER
from O
a O
tribune O
and O
then O
to O
rejoice O
: O
Down O
with O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
! O
Jews O
were O
forced O
to O
cut O
off O
the O
head O
from O
the O
Lenin B-PER
monument O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
do O
it O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Polish B-TER
police B-TER
started O
to O
beat O
them O
. O

The O
bandits O
themselves O
smashed O
the O
monument O
and O
ordered O
to O
carry O
the O
pieces O
to O
the O
Jewish B-TER
cemetery I-TER
. O

Only O
those O
who O
were O
found O
in O
possession O
of O
some O
meat B-TER
where O
arrested B-TER
, O
because O
Jews O
were O
forbidden O
to O
eat O
meat B-TER
except O
the O
tiny O
amount O
of O
bones B-TER
provided O
to O
the O
Jews O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

In O
August O
1941 O
Jews O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
contribution O
of O
140 O
thousand O
roubles O
and O
they O
were O
also O
subject O
to O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
, O
such O
as O
to O
clean O
rubble O
from O
buildings O
destroyed O
by O
the O
German B-TER
artillery O
, O
to O
transport O
construction O
materials O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
lacked O
horses O
acutely O
, O
so O
they O
forced O
the O
Jews O
to O
construct O
a O
railway O
first O
and O
then O
to O
transport O
the O
materials O
with O
bare O
hands O
( O
without O
locomotives O
) O
. O

All O
real O
estate O
that O
belonged O
to O
Jews O
was O
confiscated B-TER
and O
they O
were O
forced O
to O
give O
away O
all O
kinds O
of O
possessions O
, O
such O
as O
furniture O
, O
bed O
linen O
, O
dishes O
, O
gold O
etc O
. O

Germans B-TER
would O
also O
pillage O
Jewish O
homes O
under O
all O
kinds O
of O
pretexts O
. O

Jews O
were O
allowed O
to O
show O
themselves O
in O
the O
street O
only O
for O
3 O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
from O
3 O
to O
5 O
PM O
. O

Except O
during O
these O
three O
hours O
, O
we O
were O
forbidden B-TER
to O
leave O
the O
apartments O
, O
even O
in O
order O
to O
relieve O
ourselves O
. O

We O
were O
also O
forbidden O
to O
open O
a O
window O
and O
to O
look O
into O
the O
street O
. O

In O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
created O
on O
the O
2nd O
of O
August O
1942 O
. O

During O
the O
moving O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
the O
Germans B-TER
checked O
all O
the O
packages O
and O
took O
away O
valuables O
. O

Every O
ghetto B-TER
resident O
had O
1,1 O
square O
metre O
of O
living B-TER
space I-TER
, O
the O
height O
of O
the O
ceiling O
was O
not O
more O
than O
2,5 O
meters O
. O

Germans B-TER
threated O
the O
newly O
created O
Judenrat B-TER
and O
the O
Jewish B-TER
police I-TER
very O
badly O
. O

Once O
the O
11 O
Jewish B-TER
councilors I-TER
( O
except O
the O
chairman B-TER
) O
were O
ordered O
to O
clean O
the O
toilets O
of O
the O
town O
and O
then O
transport O
the O
waste O
outside O
the O
town O
. O

There O
were O
no O
cases O
when O
the O
Jewish O
administration O
would O
give O
away O
Jews O
into O
German B-TER
hands O
. O

Jews O
had O
to O
go O
to O
work O
outside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
every O
day O
. O

Germans B-TER
ordered O
that O
the O
food B-TER
quota O
for O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
120 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
a O
working O
person O
daily O
and O
60 O
grams O
for O
someone O
that O
did O
not O
work O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
fortnight O
– O
100 O
grams O
of O
bones B-TER
, O
only O
for O
the O
workers O
. O

Those O
who O
went O
to O
work B-TER
would O
secretly O
bring O
back O
potatoes B-TER
in O
their O
pockets O
. O

There O
were O
no O
workshops O
or O
factories B-TER
inside O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
paid O
a O
special O
tax O
to O
the O
Germans B-TER
and O
the O
Judenrat B-TER
was O
taking O
money O
from O
the O
Jews O
all O
the O
time O
in O
order O
to O
bribe O
their O
way O
out O
of O
smaller O
troubles O
. O

There O
was O
a O
canteen O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
that O
prepared O
up O
to O
1500 O
lunches B-TER
a O
day O
. O

There O
were O
some O
cases O
of O
previously O
freethinking O
persons O
who O
fell O
into O
a O
religious B-TER
mood O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Our O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
existed O
for O
three O
months O
overall O
. O

The O
despair O
was O
immense O
, O
because O
we O
knew O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
liquidation I-TER
had O
started O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

As O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
was O
annexed O
to O
the O
Third B-TER
Reich I-TER
, O
we O
believed O
that O
the O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
would O
not O
come O
so O
soon O
, O
and O
the O
Germans B-TER
would O
repeatedly O
reassure O
us O
about O
it O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
the O
2nd O
of O
November O
1942 O
, O
at O
4.30 O
AM O
, O
when O
we O
noticed O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
, O
people O
started O
to O
cut O
through O
the O
barbed O
wires O
and O
run O
in O
a O
chaotic O
fashion O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
opened O
fire O
and O
killed B-TER
a O
few O
hundred O
Jews O
. O

A O
small O
number O
managed O
to O
run O
away O
into O
the O
woods O
. O

There O
they O
founded O
a O
Jewish B-TER
partisan I-TER
unit O
comprising O
a O
hundred O
men O
. O

In O
autumn O
1943 O
this O
unit O
was O
largely O
destroyed O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
. O

The O
deportation B-TER
of O
Jews O
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
to O
Treblinka B-LOC
was O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Germans B-TER
only O
. O

Although O
after O
the O
deportation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
signs O
menacing O
to O
shoot B-TER
anyone O
that O
comes O
near O
were O
hung O
out O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
no O
one O
actually O
guarded O
it O
, O
so O
the O
local O
residents O
would O
enter O
into O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
owners O
of O
which O
were O
in O
Treblinka B-LOC
, O
at O
night O
and O
pillage O
Jewish O
possessions O
. O

They O
even O
rejoiced O
because O
of O
the O
Jewish O
misfortunes O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
were O
also O
afraid O
, O
feeling O
that O
the O
extermination B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
own O
extermination B-TER
. O

Based O
on O
the O
testimony O
of O
Binyomin B-PER
Rak I-PER
, O
a O
resident O
of O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
, O
I O
know O
that O
the O
final O
liquidation B-TER
of O
the O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
ghetto I-LOC
happened O
in O
the O
following O
way O
. O

The O
Jews O
that O
had O
stayed O
in O
the O
ghetto O
were O
packed O
into O
freight O
cars O
and O
transported O
through O
Czeremcha O
- O
Białystok O
- O
Małkinia O
- O
Treblinka O
. O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
much O
shorter O
way O
from O
Siemiatycze O
to O
Treblinka O
through O
Sokołów O
Podlaski O
( O
2 O
hours O
) O
, O
the O
victims O
were O
transported O
by O
such O
a O
long O
route O
on O
purpose O
in O
order O
for O
them O
to O
lose O
orientation O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
we O
arrived O
to O
Treblinka O
, O
but O
we O
were O
kept O
in O
the O
cars O
during O
the O
whole O
night O
. O

Only O
in O
the O
morning O
everyone O
was O
forced O
into O
a O
gas O
chamber O
and O
killed O
. O

I O
, O
as O
a O
qualified O
carpenter O
, O
was O
given O
a O
job O
in O
the O
workshops O
of O
Treblinka O
and O
managed O
to O
survive O
. O

About O
half O
a O
kilometer O
before O
Małkinia B-LOC
I O
jumped O
from O
the O
moving O
train O
through O
the O
little O
upper O
window O
. O

The O
window O
was O
very O
narrow O
and O
I O
had O
to O
take O
off O
my O
outerwear O
and O
jump O
into O
a O
- O
12 O
degree O
frost O
wearing O
only O
a O
shirt B-TER
. O

A O
few O
dozen O
persons O
from O
other O
cars O
also O
took O
this O
desperate O
step O
, O
but O
the O
guards O
shot B-TER
them O
all O
because O
they O
were O
a O
good O
target O
for O
German B-TER
bullets O
in O
a O
white O
field O
covered O
with O
snow O
. O

I O
alone O
survived O
because O
I O
did O
not O
start O
running O
away O
through O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
stood O
next O
to O
a O
car O
and O
pulled O
a O
German B-TER
guard O
by O
his O
coat O
. O

He O
turned O
around O
and O
dropped O
his O
automatic O
gun O
. O

I O
quickly O
picked O
up O
the O
gun O
, O
shot B-TER
the O
guard O
and O
took O
his O
revolver O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
do O
it O
all O
, O
because O
I O
was O
in O
one O
of O
the O
last O
cars O
and O
when O
I O
jumped O
, O
I O
landed O
towards O
the O
very O
end O
of O
a O
long O
train O
, O
where O
there O
was O
only O
a O
solitary O
German B-TER
soldier O
. O

During O
the O
first O
month O
after O
running O
away O
I O
hid B-TER
by O
a O
few O
Poles B-TER
in O
different O
villages O
. O

On O
the O
4th O
of O
December O
1942 O
I O
met O
five O
more O
Jews O
from O
Siemiatycze B-LOC
in O
the O
area O
around O
town O
and O
we O
dug O
a O
bunker O
for O
ourselves O
under O
a O
stable O
with O
the O
help O
of O
its O
owner O
, O
a O
Pole B-TER
. O

There O
I O
stayed O
until O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O
