The O
Jewish B-TER
question I-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
period O
from O
spring O
1940 O
to O
Spring O
1943 O
, O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
Germany O
were O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
deportation B-TER
began O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
in O
February O
1940 O
and O
is O
now O
largely O
completed O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
elderly O
( O
originally O
over O
65 O
, O
now O
over O
70 O
years O
) O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
in O
the O
Bohemia O
- O
Moravian O
Protectorate O
, O
whose O
former O
population O
had O
been O
evacuated B-TER
. O

The O
city O
, O
which O
originally O
had O
20 O
to O
25,000 O
inhabitants O
, O
now O
contains O
approx O
. O

50,000 O
Jews B-TER
. O

However O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
population O
consists O
only O
of O
the O
Old O
people O
, O
the O
passing O
is O
still O
very O
large O
. O

Young O
Jews B-TER
have O
been O
deployed O
to O
work B-TER
in O
various O
locations O
in O
the O
eastern O
areas O
. O

The O
deportation O
has O
been O
practiced O
somewhat O
differently O
in O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
exceptions O
that O
apply O
to O
certain O
areas O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
under O
the O
legislation O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Jews B-TER
married O
to O
Aryans B-TER
, O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
observed O
during O
the O
Deportations O
. O

The O
Jewish O
spouse O
in O
such O
a O
marriage B-TER
is O
usually O
spared O
only O
when O
he O
or O
she O
lives O
with O
the O
Aryan B-TER
partner I-TER
or O
with O
any O
common B-TER
Children I-TER
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
children O
are O
minors O
or O
adults O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
several O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
men O
married O
to O
Aryan B-TER
women O
have O
been O
deported O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
no O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
women O
married O
to O
Aryan B-TER
men O
were O
deported O
. O

There O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish O
spouse O
has O
been O
deported O
after O
the O
couple B-TER
's I-TER
only O
son O
has O
fallen B-TER
in O
the O
war O
, O
which O
otherwise O
in B-TER
Jewish I-TER
laws I-TER
justifies O
a O
privileged O
position O
. O

This O
is O
motivated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exception B-TER
from I-TER
deportation I-TER
can O
only O
be O
justified O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
the O
spouse O
or O
children O
, O
and O
that O
this O
consideration O
no O
longer O
applies O
when O
the O
child O
does O
not O
live O
at O
home O
, O
cf O
. O

above O
, O
or O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
. O

Although O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O
principle O
applies O
only O
to O
Jews B-TER
, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
special O
provisions O
in O
the O
Practice B-TER
of I-TER
Mischlinge I-TER
( O
Half B-TER
and I-TER
Quarter I-TER
Jews I-TER
) O
that O
they O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
special O
class O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
all O
areas O
where O
the O
Administration O
’s O
decisions O
are O
decisive O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
attitude I-TER
must O
be O
considered O
. O

Within O
leading O
circles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
movements O
, O
one O
that O
wants O
to O
restrict O
the O
Jewish B-TER
laws I-TER
to O
the O
real O
Jews B-TER
, O
and O
one O
more O
radical O
that O
wants O
to O
liberate B-TER
Germany O
from O
both O
Jews B-TER
and O
Bastards O
. O

Which O
movement O
ultimately O
prevails O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
, O
but O
the O
radical O
direction O
in O
recent O
times O
seems O
to O
assert O
itself O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
provision O
introduced O
in O
1942 O
, O
whereby O
half B-TER
Jews I-TER
are O
excluded B-TER
from O
the O
army O
, O
could O
be O
fatal O
. O

One O
has O
to O
consider O
, O
that O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
citizenship B-TER
links O
to O
the O
right O
to O
exercise O
civil B-TER
rights I-TER
such O
as O
military B-TER
service I-TER
and O
labor O
service O
. O

Therefore O
Mischlinge B-TER
, O
who O
fail O
to O
serve O
, O
are O
prevented B-TER
from I-TER
enjoying I-TER
civil I-TER
rights I-TER
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
in O
the O
Legislature B-TER
of O
Quarter B-TER
Jews I-TER
marrying O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
the O
Standesämter O
refuse O
to O
marry O
such O
persons O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
special O
permit O
. O

The O
limited O
access O
of O
the O
Mischlinge B-TER
to O
- O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Half B-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
total O
exclusion O
from O
- O
the O
higher B-TER
education I-TER
( O
including O
vocational O
schools O
) O
may O
in O
the O
future O
have O
the O
most O
fateful O
consequences O
, O
with O
Half B-TER
Jews I-TER
subsequently O
missing O
the O
prerequisite O
for O
becoming O
anything O
but O
unskilled O
workers B-TER
. O

Mischlinge B-TER
are O
excluded O
from O
owning O
an O
inheritance B-TER
farm I-TER
, O
requiring O
Aryan B-TER
descent I-TER
since I-TER
1800 I-TER
. O

With O
regard O
to O
other O
land O
estates O
, O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
, O
but O
in O
practice O
, O
Mischlinge B-TER
will O
generally O
be O
forced B-TER
out I-TER
of O
possession O
of O
such O
property O
, O
the O
same O
applies O
to O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
of O
Jews B-TER
. O

Mischlinge B-TER
and I-TER
non I-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
spouses I-TER
have O
free O
access O
to O
private O
businesses O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
in O
Practice O
they O
will O
often O
be O
pushed B-TER
out I-TER
of O
Companies B-TER
of O
any O
significance O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
armour B-TER
industry I-TER
– O
companies O
owned O
them O
or O
within O
which O
they O
play O
a O
large O
role O
will O
be O
excluded O
from O
public O
order O
. O

There O
are O
still O
rumours B-TER
in O
Berlin B-LOC
of O
further O
measures B-TER
taken I-TER
against I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
, O
e.g. O
, O
it O
states O
that O
a O
law B-TER
must O
be O
drawn O
up O
, O
requiring O
Aryans B-TER
who O
are O
married O
to O
Jews B-TER
to O
divorce O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Jewish B-TER
law I-TER
in O
its O
full O
extent O
could O
be O
put O
into O
effect O
also O
for O
the O
group O
of O
Jews B-TER
who O
have O
hitherto O
been O
allowed O
to O
stay O
because O
they O
were O
married O
to O
Aryans B-TER
. O

Furthermore O
, O
rumours B-TER
have O
been O
spread O
regarding O
certain O
measures O
against O
half B-TER
Jews I-TER
. O

In O
particular O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
Mischlinge B-TER
in O
cities O
, O
where O
the O
housing O
demand O
is O
high O
due O
to O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
airstrikes B-TER
, O
should O
be O
evicted O
from O
their O
apartments B-TER
. O

Whether O
this O
will O
happen O
is O
impossible O
to O
predict O
. O

However O
, O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
it O
has O
been O
noted O
that O
the O
Campaign B-TER
against O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
the O
Press B-TER
has O
now O
been O
intensified O
again O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
lately O
, O
Mischlinge B-TER
has O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
Bastards O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Mischling B-TER
problem I-TER
is O
to O
a O
significant O
degree O
an O
upper O
- O
class O
problem O
; O
since O
the O
mixed B-TER
marriages I-TER
have O
mainly O
taken O
place O
within O
the O
bourgeoisie O
, O
there O
could O
also O
be O
an O
unfortunate O
impact O
on O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Mischlinge B-TER
. O
