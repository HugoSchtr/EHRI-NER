Report O
Six O
days O
after O
Hitler B-PER
’s I-PER
invasion B-TER
of O
Prague B-LOC
, O
the O
merchant B-TER
Robert B-PER
K. I-PER
killed B-TER
himself O
by O
throwing O
himself O
down O
the O
staircase O
of O
his O
home B-TER
. O

R. B-PER
K. I-PER
had O
been O
arranging O
his O
emigration B-TER
to O
England B-LOC
since O
the O
Munich B-LOC
Agreement O
, O
but O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
quickly O
enough O
. O

The O
work B-TER
permit I-TER
from O
the O
Home O
Office O
had O
not O
gone O
through O
in O
February O
, O
as O
was O
expected O
. O

As O
K. B-PER
was O
associated O
with O
the O
Czech B-LOC
government B-TER
, O
as O
well O
as O
with O
the O
Petschekbank B-LOC
, O
This O
likely O
refers O
to O
the O
Petschek O
Palace O
, O
though O
uncertain O
of O
the O
context O
( O
e.g. O
why O
an O
association O
would O
make O
R.K O
a O
target O
of O
the O
Nazis O
) O
. O

his O
suicide B-TER
was O
pre O
- O
emptive O
; O
he O
would O
have O
met O
the O
same O
fate O
shortly O
after O
. O

Three O
days O
later O
, O
his O
82 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
mother O
died B-TER
too O
. O

The O
two O
older O
children B-ORG
were O
in O
England B-LOC
. O

The O
youngest O
, O
Gertrud B-PER
, O
went O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
school B-TER
that O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Nazis O
in O
March O
, O
and O
had O
to O
do O
her O
Abitur B-TER
there O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
their O
mother O
had O
tried O
everything O
to O
arrange O
emigration B-TER
for O
her O
and O
Gertrud B-PER
. O

The O
entry O
papers O
from O
England B-LOC
arrived O
shortly O
after O
K B-PER
's I-PER
. I-PER

death B-TER
. O

But O
the O
emigration B-TER
visa B-TER
from O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities B-TER
could O
not O
be O
obtained O
. O

The O
difficulties O
mounted O
up O
. O

Finally O
, O
her O
friends O
gave O
her O
the O
address O
of O
a O
young O
secretary O
who O
had O
helped O
her O
boss O
to O
emigrate B-TER
, O
as O
she O
had O
connections O
with O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
middle O
- O
man O
. O

This O
secretary O
, O
Fritzi O
, O
introduced O
her O
to O
Fritz B-PER
Smetana I-PER
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
, O
he O
assured O
her O
that O
she O
should O
not O
worry O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
the O
Chief O
at O
the O
Bank O
( O
code O
word O
for O
Gestapo B-ORG
) O
, O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
an O
understanding O
, O
and O
he O
had O
promised O
him O
everything O
for O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Fritzi O
added O
that O
she O
had O
spoken O
with O
Mr. O
Schubert B-PER
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
boss O
; O
he O
wanted O
a O
new O
car O
, O
but O
had O
not O
got O
the O
money B-TER
together O
for O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
said O
to O
him O
that O
he O
could O
have O
it O
, O
but O
first O
he O
had O
get O
the O
two O
ladies O
out O
. O

The O
attempts O
to O
leave O
had O
begun O
on O
the O
9th O
June O
1939 O
, O
when O
the O
English B-LOC
visa B-TER
had O
arrived O
. O

First O
, O
one O
needed O
a O
doctor B-TER
’s I-TER
note O
for O
a O
stay O
in O
Karlsbad B-LOC
, O
which O
the O
police B-TER
doctor B-TER
issued O
, O
with O
an O
objective O
reason O
. O

But O
, O
on O
the O
next O
day O
, O
Neurath B-PER
’s I-PER
orders B-TER
were O
announced O
without O
warning O
. O

( O
Travel B-TER
restrictions I-TER
etc O
. O

, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
Nuremberg B-LOC
Laws B-TER
) O
. O

The O
former O
head O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
Freiherr B-PER
von I-PER
Dürren I-PER
, O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
, O
then O
came O
the O
Bank O
Holidays O
, O
when O
all O
the O
offices O
were O
closed O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
it O
became O
July O
. O

The O
promised O
emigration B-TER
was O
delayed O
again O
, O
because O
original O
copies O
of O
the O
baptism B-TER
certificates O
had O
to O
be O
submitted O
. O

( O
The O
baptism B-TER
had O
only O
recently O
been O
performed O
. O

It O
made O
it O
possible O
for O
us O
to O
get O
a O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
) O
. O

This O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
expired O
on O
15th O
July O
. O

The O
date O
of O
the O
baptism B-TER
was O
written O
illegibly O
, O
so O
the O
Priest B-TER
had O
to O
re O
- O
write O
it O
. O

Then O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
caused O
some O
further O
difficulties O
. O

Nobody O
, O
except O
for O
the O
mother O
’s O
parents O
, O
was O
allowed O
to O
know O
about O
the O
intended O
journey O
. O

On O
the O
6th O
July O
, O
Fritz O
informed O
them O
that O
he O
had O
to O
produce O
another O
tax B-TER
exemption O
form O
, O
but O
this O
would O
take O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Did O
they O
have O
any O
friends O
in O
Holland B-LOC
? O
Because O
the O
route O
through O
Slovakia B-LOC
would O
be O
quite O
a O
challenge O
. O

On O
6th O
July O
, O
Fritz B-PER
and O
Fritzi O
met O
them O
with O
long O
faces O
: O
the O
journey O
through O
Germany B-LOC
, O
to O
Holland B-LOC
, O
would O
unfortunately O
not O
be O
possible O
, O
a O
tax B-TER
exemption O
form O
was O
required O
and O
, O
although O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
buy O
these O
, O
that O
would O
certainly O
take O
too O
long O
as O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
would O
expire O
. O

Do O
not O
worry O
, O
we O
will O
travel O
through O
Slovakia O
. O

A O
friend O
, O
a O
LithuanianJournalist O
, O
is O
coming O
to O
collect O
me O
. O

Bring O
a O
small O
suitcase O
. O

On O
the O
following O
Sunday O
evening O
, O
Fritz B-PER
came O
back O
– O
everything O
was O
in O
order O
, O
they O
would O
travel O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
tomorrow O
to O
collect O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
, O
they O
should O
meet O
in O
the O
evening O
in O
Brünn B-LOC
. O

We O
will O
give O
you O
addresses O
for O
where O
you O
can O
stay B-TER
privately O
overnight O
, O
then O
you O
need O
to O
travel O
straight O
to O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
your O
friends O
will O
lend O
you O
the O
money B-TER
for O
the O
flights O
to O
London B-LOC
. O

( O
Which O
could O
obviously O
not O
be O
purchased O
in O
Prague B-LOC
) O
. O

On O
Monday O
, O
Smetana B-PER
did O
not O
receive O
the O
passports B-TER
that O
he O
had O
been O
promised O
. O

Herr O
Schubert O
is O
of O
course O
furious O
that O
I O
was O
n’t O
sent O
the O
passports O
, O
and O
is O
trying O
everything O
he O
can O
to O
get O
them O
. O

Mother O
and O
daughter O
waited O
all O
day O
for O
the O
call O
to O
say O
when O
Fritz B-PER
could O
set O
off O
. O

On O
Tuesday O
, O
they O
were O
told O
that O
they O
should O
leave O
the O
following O
morning O
, O
and O
go O
to O
Hodonin B-LOC
, O
a O
village O
on O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
. O

There O
, O
they O
should O
meet O
Smetana B-PER
in O
a O
guesthouse B-TER
opposite O
the O
station O
. O

Fritzi O
, O
who O
delivered O
this O
message O
, O
went O
on O
to O
explain O
that O
Smetana B-PER
had O
called O
her O
from O
her O
bed O
at O
10 O
pm O
, O
because O
he O
needed O
money B-TER
in O
order O
to O
purchase O
the O
necessary O
Pengö B-TER
and O
Marks B-TER
from O
the O
waiter O
at O
Hotel B-TER
Sroubek O
. O

After O
11 O
pm O
, O
he O
called O
again O
to O
say O
that O
he O
was O
already O
over O
the O
town O
border O
. O

The O
day O
was O
spent O
saying O
farewells O
, O
packing O
a O
few O
things O
and O
trying O
to O
put O
the O
house B-TER
in O
order O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
without O
making O
it O
known O
that O
they O
were O
planning O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
a O
long O
distance O
call O
from O
Luhacovice B-LOC
surprised O
them O
, O
which O
she O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
take O
at O
first O
, O
Fritz B-PER
called O
, O
he O
had O
the O
emigration B-TER
papers O
, O
he O
just O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Bratislava B-LOC
to O
get O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
. O

Everything O
else O
was O
going O
as O
planned O
. O

Shortly O
after O
5 O
am O
, O
they O
left O
the O
house B-TER
. O

The O
( O
Czech B-LOC
) O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
they O
had O
wanted O
to O
avoid O
, O
came O
out O
to O
wish O
them O
luck O
, O
her O
only O
son O
had O
also O
left O
, O
to O
Batavia O
. O

The O
journey O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
passed O
without O
further O
incident O
. O

Then O
they O
went O
on O
to O
Hodonin B-LOC
on O
a O
slow O
train B-TER
. O

The O
Guesthouse B-TER
opposite O
the O
station O
bore O
a O
large O
sign O
saying O
: O
Attention O
! O
Jewish B-TER
Business I-TER
. O

In O
the O
dining B-TER
room I-TER
, O
old O
men B-TER
sat O
around O
playing O
cards O
. O

The O
mother B-TER
and O
daughter B-TER
ordered O
coffee B-TER
and O
waited O
. O

Fritz B-PER
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
at O
four O
o’clock O
, O
five O
thirty O
came O
and O
went O
, O
then O
it O
was O
seven O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
Fritz B-PER
came O
and O
sat O
himself O
down O
at O
their O
table O
. O

Milady O
, O
I O
’ve O
got O
the O
tickets O
for O
the O
outward O
journey O
, O
but O
the O
Hungarianvisa O
was O
not O
put O
on O
the O
passports O
that O
I O
have O
here O
( O
i.e. O
have O
received O
the O
identity O
documents O
) O
. O

I O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
travel O
to O
Prague O
again O
– O
then O
you O
will O
travel O
to O
Luhacovice O
, O
to O
meet O
my O
uncle O
, O
and O
wait O
there O
for O
me O
. O

But O
now O
I O
have O
to O
meet O
the O
gentlemen O
here O
, O
so O
I O
will O
come O
back O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
a O
blonde O
woman O
will O
come O
over O
to O
you O
, O
she O
’s O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
Gestapoman O
, O
give O
her O
the O
money O
that O
you O
have O
with O
you O
. O

She O
is O
completely O
trustworthy O
. O

Before O
we O
could O
ask O
any O
questions O
, O
he O
left O
. O

A O
few O
minutes O
later O
, O
along O
came O
a O
very O
blonde O
, O
plump O
woman B-TER
, O
who O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
and O
began O
to O
talk O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
I O
slid O
the O
money B-TER
over O
to O
her O
under O
the O
newspaper B-TER
that O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
table O
, O
she O
took O
it O
and O
disappeared O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
hide O
it O
, O
then O
she O
explained O
to O
us O
that O
her O
husband O
was O
a O
musical B-TER
director O
who O
was O
now O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
and O
explained O
other O
things O
; O
she O
seemed O
fairly O
well O
- O
informed O
. O

Then O
Fritz O
returned O
. O

Everything O
is O
organised O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
owns O
a O
cinema O
, O
he O
has O
a O
cinema O
here O
, O
another O
in O
Holíč O
, O
that O
is O
the O
next O
village O
, O
over O
the O
Slovakian O
border O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
, O
he O
can O
travel O
back O
and O
forth O
over O
the O
border O
as O
he O
pleases O
. O

We O
’ll O
get O
a O
taxi O
to O
the O
marketplace O
now O
and O
wait O
for O
him O
there O
, O
and O
he O
will O
take O
you O
over O
the O
border O
. O

My O
friend O
is O
bringing O
me O
your O
passports O
, O
I O
will O
take O
them O
to O
Prague O
for O
the O
visa O
, O
and O
then O
bring O
them O
back O
for O
you O
. O

Then O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
taxi O
and O
waited O
. O

A O
man B-TER
came O
along O
and O
greeted O
Fritz B-PER
; O
that O
was O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
journalist B-TER
, O
he O
got O
into O
the O
car O
too O
and O
the O
two O
men B-TER
chatted O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
to O
gradually O
get O
nervous O
. O

Every O
second O
, O
German B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
drove O
past O
on O
motorbikes O
. O

Lots O
of O
other O
vehicles O
came O
past O
too O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
small O
, O
grey O
Tatra O
( O
Czech B-LOC
car O
brand O
) O
came O
along O
and O
stopped O
a O
few O
metres O
away O
. O

A O
man B-TER
got O
out O
, O
and O
Fritz B-PER
and O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
went O
over O
to O
him O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
three O
men B-TER
appeared O
to O
negotiate O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

Fritz O
came O
back O
, O
got O
into O
the O
car O
and O
told O
the O
driver O
he O
should O
drive O
right O
up O
to O
the O
other O
car O
. O

Then O
he O
gave O
us O
two O
exit O
passes B-TER
( O
the O
pink O
tickets O
for O
so O
- O
called O
‘ O
small O
border O
traffic O
’ O
, O
which O
permitted O
the O
holders O
to O
travel O
back O
and O
forth O
between O
border O
areas O
, O
for O
work O
purposes O
, O
for O
the O
day O
. O

) O
Everything O
is O
organised O
. O

Now O
we O
will O
drive O
to O
a O
hotel O
, O
where O
we O
must O
swap O
the O
car O
as O
inconspicuously O
as O
possible O
. O

In O
front O
of O
the O
hotel B-TER
entrance O
stood O
the O
other O
car O
, O
with O
its O
bonnet O
facing O
us O
. O

The O
men B-TER
– O
there O
were O
two O
of O
them O
– O
went O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
, O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
went O
too O
, O
then O
came O
a O
porter O
who O
took O
our O
luggage O
out O
of O
the O
taxi O
and O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
the O
Porter O
carried O
our O
suitcase O
out O
of O
the O
building O
and O
to O
the O
other O
car O
. O

Then O
, O
Mother B-TER
and O
I O
got O
out O
This O
sentence O
ends O
with O
… O
schaute O
und O
Geschafte O
an O
, O
which O
does O
n’t O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
meaning O
– O
perhaps O
it O
is O
a O
mistake O
. O

Once O
we O
had O
waited O
for O
long O
enough O
, O
we O
got O
into O
the O
Tatra O
car O
, O
into O
which O
they O
had O
put O
our O
suitcases O
. O

It O
got O
dark O
. O

Fritz B-PER
Smetana I-PER
said O
goodbye O
, O
giving O
us O
lots O
of O
assurance O
. O

Then O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
came O
along O
and O
started O
looking O
for O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
turning O
every O
bit O
of O
paper O
lying O
on O
the O
street O
over O
with O
his O
foot O
, O
said O
Everything O
is O
fine O
, O
and O
went O
back O
into O
the O
hotel B-TER
. O

Then O
we O
waited O
. O

Finally O
, O
three O
men B-TER
came O
out O
of O
the O
hotel B-TER
: O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
, O
the O
Lithuanian B-LOC
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
left O
straight O
away O
, O
and O
the O
third O
man B-TER
, O
who O
must O
have O
been O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
. O

He O
did O
n’t O
look O
that O
bad O
, O
quite O
a O
young O
guy O
. O

The O
German B-LOC
produced O
our O
papers O
, O
he O
already O
had O
the O
border O
ticket O
and O
the O
passports B-TER
, O
and O
said O
that O
we O
should O
n’t O
worry O
and O
we O
should O
only O
speak O
if O
we O
were O
asked O
questions O
. O

So O
finally O
we O
set O
off O
. O

After O
ten O
minutes O
, O
a O
barrier O
was O
laid O
down O
on O
the O
road O
, O
we O
were O
trapped O
at O
the O
border O
. O

The O
barrier O
was O
taken O
up O
, O
we O
drove O
through O
, O
and O
it O
was O
laid O
down O
again O
directly O
after O
we O
had O
passed O
. O

Now O
there O
was O
no O
going O
back O
anymore O
. O

In O
front O
of O
us O
was O
a O
big O
, O
elegant O
car O
and O
the O
passengers O
came O
out O
of O
the O
border O
office O
, O
and O
put O
individual O
pieces O
of O
their O
expensive O
clothing B-TER
back O
into O
the O
car O
. O

That O
implied O
a O
very O
thorough O
border O
examination O
. O

Your O
passports O
please O
, O
a O
German B-LOC
voice O
said O
, O
and O
suddenly O
a O
German B-LOC
soldier B-TER
was O
standing O
before O
us O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
on O
the O
Czechoslovakian B-LOC
border O
, O
there O
were O
no O
Czech B-LOC
officials O
anywhere O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

Our O
Gestapo B-ORG
men B-TER
took O
the O
passports B-TER
out O
of O
the O
car O
. O

Today O
I O
have O
two O
ladies O
with O
me O
too O
, O
he O
said O
, O
casually O
. O

How O
much O
money O
do O
they O
have O
? O
Thirty O
koruna O
, O
the O
two O
of O
us O
said O
. O

Check O
the O
handbags O
, O
suggests O
a O
small O
, O
unsympathetic O
man B-TER
to O
our O
soldiers B-TER
. O

I O
took O
mine O
our O
first O
, O
he O
looked O
through O
all O
the O
pockets O
, O
finally O
he O
got O
to O
the O
small O
purse O
, O
in O
which O
I O
kept O
both O
suitcase O
keys O
, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
a O
polite O
manner O
. O

He O
only O
asked O
whether O
I O
had O
these O
suitcases O
in O
the O
car O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
bag O
back O
to O
me O
, O
then O
afterwards O
he O
searched O
Mutzi O
’s O
bag O
, O
checked O
our O
permits O
to O
travel O
across O
the O
border O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
over O
the O
bridge O
to O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
office O
. O

With O
the O
border O
officials O
there O
, O
our O
two O
companions O
just O
made O
silly O
jokes O
, O
showed O
our O
passes B-TER
, O
then O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
shone O
a O
bright O
torch O
at O
us O
, O
and O
we O
drove O
on O
into O
Slovakian B-LOC
land O
. O

So O
, O
we O
are O
over O
the O
border O
said O
our O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
. O

Mutzi O
let O
out O
a O
breath O
and O
I O
felt O
much O
lighter O
. O

I O
wondered O
whether O
we O
were O
away O
from O
the O
Nazis O
forever O
now O
. O

We O
drove O
on O
for O
about O
another O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
on O
a O
very O
pretty O
road O
to O
Holíč B-LOC
, O
the O
next O
village O
. O

There O
, O
we O
stopped O
outside O
the O
only O
guesthouse B-TER
in O
this O
tiny O
village O
, O
and O
got O
out O
of O
the O
car O
. O

So O
, O
you O
must O
stay O
here O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
passports O
, O
which O
I O
can O
hopefully O
bring O
back O
for O
you O
as O
early O
as O
tomorrow O
, O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
said O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
took O
my O
bracelet O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
and O
some O
money B-TER
, O
which O
he O
gave O
to O
us O
, O
then O
he O
booked O
a O
room B-TER
for O
us O
and O
went O
into O
the O
guesthouse B-TER
with O
us O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
dreaming O
. O

Did O
that O
really O
all O
happen O
? O
While O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
our O
evening O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
chatted O
to O
our O
travelling O
companions O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
say O
one O
more O
thing O
to O
you O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
said O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
you O
are O
very O
near O
the O
border O
and O
border O
surveillance O
is O
patrolling O
constantly O
, O
so O
show O
yourselves O
in O
public O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
otherwise O
you O
might O
attract O
attention O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
would O
be O
to O
stay O
in O
your O
room O
. O

As O
identification O
, O
you O
have O
the O
permit O
to O
cross O
the O
border O
with O
you O
, O
and O
if O
anyone O
happens O
to O
ask O
, O
though O
I O
am O
quite O
sure O
that O
no O
one O
will O
, O
then O
say O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
my O
sister O
’s O
wedding O
, O
but O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
here O
because O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
car O
. O

My O
sister O
’s O
name O
is O
Soundse O
, O
and O
she O
lives O
two O
villages O
on O
. O

You O
know O
, O
today O
I O
was O
really O
sweating O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
sitting O
on O
hot O
coals O
, O
and O
when O
I O
feel O
like O
that O
, O
then O
it O
really O
means O
something O
. O

And O
then O
he O
asked O
Mutzi O
: O
What O
did O
you O
take O
out O
of O
your O
bag O
while O
the O
official O
was O
searching O
your O
daughter O
? O
I O
did O
see O
you O
do O
it O
, O
lucky O
that O
the O
official O
did O
n’t O
see O
, O
because O
you O
know O
, O
if O
they O
get O
suspicious O
then O
things O
really O
do O
get O
difficult O
. O

Mutzi O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
it O
was O
only O
a O
Franc B-TER
, O
which O
she O
had O
happened O
to O
find O
in O
her O
bag O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
left O
it O
in O
the O
car O
. O

But O
, O
anyway O
, O
we O
had O
got O
through O
alright O
. O

The O
German B-LOC
went O
on O
to O
explain O
to O
us O
that O
he O
had O
driven O
through O
the O
whole O
previous O
night O
to O
get O
us O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
visa B-TER
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

Then O
, O
he O
told O
us O
again O
not O
to O
repeat O
anything O
that O
he O
had O
told O
us O
. O

You O
see O
, O
we O
want O
to O
go O
on O
to O
help O
others O
too O
. O

He O
came O
from O
Bavaria B-LOC
, O
and O
really O
was O
a O
nice O
man B-TER
. O

The O
other O
man B-TER
promised O
us O
he O
would O
give O
the O
passports B-TER
to O
Fritz B-PER
straight O
away O
, O
so O
he O
could O
set O
off O
for O
Prague B-LOC
that O
evening O
and O
aim O
to O
be O
back O
by O
the O
following O
evening O
. O

And O
then O
they O
said O
their O
goodbyes O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
left O
sitting O
there O
, O
in O
the O
little O
Slovakian B-LOC
village O
, O
we O
ate O
a O
little O
something O
again O
and O
told O
the O
landlord O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
have O
tomorrow O
’s O
meals B-TER
delivered O
to O
our O
room B-TER
, O
and O
then O
we O
went O
upstairs O
. O

The O
room B-TER
looked O
nice O
and O
clean O
, O
and O
, O
most O
importantly O
, O
we O
hoped O
to O
only O
have O
to O
stay O
there O
for O
one O
night O
. O

It O
had O
become O
quite O
late O
and O
we O
went O
straight O
to O
bed O
. O

We O
had O
certainly O
been O
through O
enough O
that O
day O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
tired O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
could O
sleep O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
tell O
each O
other O
this O
, O
as O
neither O
of O
us O
wanted O
to O
disturb O
the O
other O
, O
but O
, O
as O
we O
lay O
there O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
the O
situation O
first O
began O
to O
sink O
in O
for O
me O
properly O
. O

Now O
, O
we O
were O
over O
the O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
, O
without O
passports B-TER
, O
with O
only O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
money B-TER
, O
relying O
completely O
on O
the O
honesty O
of O
two O
strange O
men B-TER
; O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
Fritz B-PER
did O
n’t O
get O
the O
visa B-TER
, O
if O
they O
did O
n’t O
bring O
us O
the O
passports B-TER
, O
if O
someone O
here O
suspected O
, O
etc O
. O

etc O
… O
Mutzi O
was O
probably O
wondering O
about O
exactly O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
we O
both O
got O
up O
cheerfully O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
and O
neither O
of O
us O
mentioned O
any O
of O
our O
worries O
, O
but O
instead O
reminded O
each O
other O
how O
good O
it O
was O
that O
we O
were O
over O
the O
border O
, O
and O
that O
Fritz B-PER
would O
hopefully O
take O
us O
over O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
border O
that O
evening O
, O
as O
he O
had O
promised O
. O

In O
my O
head O
, O
I O
kept O
trying O
to O
calculate O
the O
distance O
between O
Hodonin B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
had O
a O
shock O
when O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
what O
a O
huge O
distance O
it O
was O
. O

Maybe O
Fritz B-PER
had O
not O
been O
seen O
straight O
away O
at O
the O
embassy B-TER
– O
but O
there O
was O
no O
point O
in O
thinking O
about O
that O
so O
much O
. O

After O
breakfast B-TER
we O
sorted O
some O
things O
out O
, O
and O
then O
we O
had O
nothing O
left O
to O
do O
. O

Mutzi O
, O
we O
wo O
n’t O
decide O
anything O
now O
– O
we O
can O
see O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
money O
tomorrow O
, O
when O
we O
’re O
on O
the O
train O
, O
I O
said O
. O

So O
, O
we O
went O
downstairs O
to O
see O
the O
hotel B-TER
manager O
, O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
we O
were O
leaving O
early O
and O
to O
ask O
whether O
we O
could O
be O
driven O
to O
the O
station O
. O

We O
paid O
our O
bill O
, O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
. O

Or O
, O
more O
accurately O
, O
we O
laid O
down O
and O
began O
to O
try O
and O
decide O
what O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
tomorrow O
would O
be O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
did O
not O
tell O
each O
other O
of O
our O
concerns O
, O
instead O
we O
both O
tried O
to O
convince O
ourselves O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
fine O
. O

It O
was O
all O
quite O
ridiculous O
– O
Mutzi O
and O
I O
were O
really O
lying O
in O
a O
tiny O
hotel B-TER
in O
Holíč B-LOC
, O
( O
naturally O
, O
I O
had O
never O
heard O
the O
name O
of O
this O
place O
before O
in O
my O
life O
) O
on O
the O
run B-TER
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
our O
home B-TER
– O
but O
on O
our O
way O
to O
Fietz O
and O
Lisinka O
( O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
as O
mentioned O
earlier O
in O
the O
report O
) O
Slightly O
unclear O
here O
, O
though O
it O
seems O
Fietz O
and O
Lisinka O
are O
likely O
the O
friends O
in O
Hungary O
mentioned O
on O
page O
2 O
, O
I O
had O
to O
keep O
reminding O
myself O
of O
that O
, O
as O
it O
helped O
me O
to O
regain O
my O
courage O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
there O
was O
no O
going O
back O
for O
us O
anymore O
, O
as O
we O
had O
finally O
got O
over O
the O
border O
. O

Why O
should O
n’t O
we O
take O
the O
money B-TER
with O
us O
, O
anyway O
? O
It O
was O
our O
property B-TER
, O
and O
we O
had O
had O
to O
leave O
everything O
else O
behind O
, O
and O
why O
– O
just O
because O
one O
man B-TER
had O
gone O
crazy O
and O
wanted O
to O
take O
over O
the O
world O
. O

and O
had O
cause O
more O
harm O
than O
you O
could O
even O
comprehend O
. O

When O
I O
thought O
about O
that O
; O
that O
we O
had O
to O
smuggle B-TER
money B-TER
illegally B-TER
across O
the O
border O
, O
I O
got O
quite O
worked O
up O
– O
but O
it O
really O
was O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

Let O
’s O
worry O
about O
that O
later O
– O
it O
’s O
still O
a O
whole O
day O
away O
, O
and O
we O
can O
wait O
until O
then O
to O
see O
what O
we O
’ll O
have O
to O
do O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
hotel B-TER
manager O
drove O
us O
to O
the O
station O
. O

We O
were O
very O
early O
for O
the O
train B-TER
, O
and O
so O
I O
watched O
the O
people B-TER
who O
were O
there O
waiting O
for O
the O
train B-TER
with O
us O
. O

It O
was O
simple O
farm O
folk O
, O
who O
all O
looked O
so O
good O
- O
natured O
and O
chatted O
pleasantly O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Maybe O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
I O
would O
gladly O
have O
swapped O
places O
with O
them O
, O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
nervous O
that O
we O
would O
stand O
out O
there O
, O
and O
if O
a O
man O
happened O
to O
walk O
by O
us O
twice O
, O
I O
thought O
he O
might O
be O
spying O
on O
us O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
train B-TER
was O
delayed O
, O
it O
had O
certainly O
been O
stopped O
at O
the O
border O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
came O
, O
and O
we O
set O
off O
with O
three O
stops O
and O
no O
notable O
events O
or O
issues O
to O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
we O
gave O
in O
our O
bag O
and O
went O
into O
the O
city O
. O

The O
city O
itself O
is O
quite O
beautiful O
, O
especially O
the O
Danube B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
very O
wide O
there O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
about O
midday O
. O

First O
, O
we O
bought O
our O
tickets O
, O
actually O
, O
we O
booked O
them O
, O
as O
we O
could O
n’t O
pick O
them O
up O
until O
the O
afternoon O
, O
and O
then O
we O
went O
to O
go O
and O
have O
lunch B-TER
. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
somewhere O
nice O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
using O
the O
last O
of O
our O
money B-TER
, O
as O
who O
knew O
whether O
we O
would O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
again O
. O

So O
, O
we O
made O
our O
way O
to O
the O
Carlton O
, O
the O
best O
hotel B-TER
in O
Bratislava B-LOC
. O

After O
wondering O
around O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
and O
asking O
some O
people B-TER
, O
we O
finally O
got O
there O
. O

It O
was O
really O
nice O
, O
the O
company O
was O
very O
mixed O
, O
partly O
good O
foreign O
people B-TER
, O
and O
partly O
Nazis O
. O

After O
the O
meal B-TER
, O
we O
went O
to O
pick O
up O
our O
tickets O
, O
and O
then O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
and O
have O
a O
coffee B-TER
, O
we O
had O
to O
use O
up O
all O
our O
time O
somewhere O
, O
so O
after O
we O
had O
walked O
around O
the O
square O
twice O
, O
backwards O
and O
forwards O
, O
we O
went O
into O
the O
first O
, O
best O
café B-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
a O
Nazi O
café B-TER
, O
which O
we O
noticed O
, O
to O
our O
shock O
. O

But O
we O
stayed O
there O
anyway O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
the O
Nazis O
but O
, O
there O
, O
we O
had O
to O
go O
into O
a O
café B-TER
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
favourite O
meeting O
- O
place O
for O
Nazis O
. O

everywhere O
, O
the O
Völkischer O
Beobachter O
etc O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
mother B-TER
said O
You O
know O
, O
we O
should O
really O
still O
try O
and O
get O
some O
Pengö O
, O
I O
think O
the O
Carlton O
would O
be O
the O
most O
likely O
place O
to O
have O
them O
So O
, O
we O
went O
back O
once O
again O
and O
asked O
the O
porter O
, O
naturally O
he O
did O
not O
have O
any O
Pengö B-TER
, O
but O
in O
the O
travel O
office O
there O
we O
could O
get O
30 O
Pengö B-TER
, O
we O
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
take O
more O
with O
us O
, O
apparently O
. O

When O
the O
man B-TER
there O
saw O
our O
Czech B-LOC
passes B-TER
, O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
how O
we O
had O
managed O
to O
get O
out O
, O
and O
went O
on O
to O
tell O
us O
how O
he O
had O
tried O
hard O
to O
get O
his O
family B-TER
out O
, O
but O
that O
it O
had O
proved O
completely O
impossible O
. O

Then O
it O
was O
five O
o’clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
which O
meant O
we O
still O
had O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

We O
definitely O
had O
to O
go O
and O
buy O
some O
black O
cloth B-TER
, O
as O
Smetana B-PER
had O
advised O
. O

So O
we O
went O
to O
the O
Jewish O
quarter O
. O

It O
looked O
terrible O
there O
, O
many O
of O
the O
shops B-TER
were O
completely O
locked O
up O
, O
the O
others O
were O
half O
empty O
and O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
shop B-TER
that O
was O
not O
damaged O
. O

On O
every O
single O
one O
, O
there O
was O
some O
kind O
of O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
inscription I-TER
, O
and O
some O
were O
wrecked O
. O

We O
went O
inside O
one O
of O
them O
and O
the O
people B-TER
there O
were O
so O
unhappy O
and O
depressed O
and O
tried O
to O
offer O
us O
all O
their O
wares O
. O

After O
we O
had O
got O
the O
piece O
of O
cloth B-TER
, O
we O
went O
to O
a O
coffee B-TER
house I-TER
again O
, O
this O
time O
a O
very O
nationalist B-TER
Czech B-LOC
one O
, O
which O
was O
decidedly O
more O
comfortable O
. O

We O
still O
had O
about O
a O
hundred O
Koruna B-TER
left O
over O
, O
which O
we O
wanted O
to O
spent O
, O
as O
we O
could O
not O
take O
them O
with O
us O
. O

So O
we O
looked O
around O
the O
shops B-TER
a O
bit O
more O
, O
but O
most O
of O
them O
were O
already O
closed O
and O
so O
we O
did O
not O
buy O
anything O
more O
at O
all O
. O

We O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
station O
and O
had O
a O
larger O
dinner O
there O
, O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
some O
more O
of O
the O
money B-TER
. O

Mutzi O
wanted O
simply O
to O
throw O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
away O
, O
as O
we O
did O
not O
dare O
give O
it O
to O
the O
guard O
. O

We O
bought O
some O
cigarettes O
for O
Friedl O
, O
and O
a O
book B-TER
, O
then O
boarded O
the O
train B-TER
. O

It O
was O
not O
as O
empty O
as O
we O
had O
predicted O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
empty O
compartment B-TER
, O
which O
we O
headed O
straight O
into O
, O
but O
what O
should O
we O
do O
with O
the O
money B-TER
now O
? O
Mutzi O
still O
had O
it O
in O
her O
jacket B-TER
and O
was O
going O
to O
throw O
it O
out O
of O
the O
window O
, O
but O
a O
Slovakian B-LOC
border O
official O
suddenly O
appeared O
before O
us O
and O
asked O
how O
much O
money B-TER
we O
had O
with O
us O
. O

We O
had O
not O
expected O
Bratislava B-LOC
to O
be O
so O
near O
the O
border O
, O
what O
should O
we O
do O
now O
? O
Ja O
' O
ale O
ješte O
mi O
30 O
korun O
sebou O
( O
I O
actually O
still O
have O
30 O
Kč B-TER
on O
me O
) O
said O
Mutzi O
, O
namely O
, O
the O
Czech B-LOC
money B-TER
that O
we O
still O
had O
with O
us O
. O

The O
officials O
were O
particularly O
nice O
, O
one O
was O
a O
very O
young O
solider B-TER
, O
they O
wanted O
us O
to O
send O
the O
money B-TER
back O
to O
a O
Prague B-LOC
address O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
do O
that O
and O
offered O
it O
to O
them O
, O
which O
, O
naturally O
, O
they O
refused O
. O

After O
a O
long O
discussion O
, O
we O
agreed O
that O
we O
would O
deposit O
it O
with O
them O
. O

Až O
se O
vrátí O
mužete O
si O
pro O
to O
přijít O
( O
When O
you O
return O
, O
you O
can O
collect O
it O
) O
… O
And O
then O
they O
left O
, O
the O
train B-TER
travelled O
onwards O
and O
nothing O
else O
happened O
, O
I O
had O
expected O
that O
the O
officials O
would O
come O
back O
again O
, O
but O
only O
the O
Hungarians B-LOC
came O
along O
, O
and O
then O
we O
were O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

What O
should O
we O
do O
now O
? O
We O
stood O
by O
the O
window O
, O
behind O
the O
curtains O
, O
of O
course O
, O
so O
nobody O
could O
see O
us O
, O
and O
watched O
the O
residents O
. O

It O
was O
a O
long O
village O
road O
with O
very O
little O
traffic O
, O
every O
now O
and O
then O
a O
lorry O
or O
bicycle O
went O
by O
. O

Across O
from O
us O
was O
a O
small O
house B-TER
where O
it O
seemed O
that O
countless O
people B-TER
lived O
, O
as O
every O
other O
blink O
of O
the O
eye O
a O
different O
person O
appeared O
at O
the O
window O
. O

So O
, O
at O
least O
we O
had O
a O
little O
distraction O
. O

By O
the O
toilet O
in O
our O
guesthouse B-TER
there O
was O
a O
small O
balcony O
that O
overlooked O
a O
little O
garden O
, O
we O
went O
out O
there O
for O
some O
fresh O
air O
, O
because O
we O
mostly O
kept O
the O
window O
in O
our O
room B-TER
closed O
… O
today O
is O
the O
13th O
, O
in O
two O
days O
the O
French B-LOC
visa B-TER
would O
run O
out O
, O
what O
then O
? O
We O
could O
n’t O
go O
back O
anymore O
. O

We O
ate B-TER
, O
stood O
at O
the O
window O
again O
and O
waited O
. O

After O
tea B-TER
, O
we O
saw O
the O
small O
car O
outside O
, O
it O
was O
really O
the O
cinema O
- O
owner O
, O
he O
got O
out O
and O
waved O
at O
us O
, O
came O
up O
, O
but O
he O
had O
not O
spoken O
to O
Fritz B-PER
yet O
, O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
see O
him O
. O

It O
was O
past O
9 O
o’clock O
when O
he O
knocked O
on O
our O
door O
. O

Everything O
is O
in O
order O
, O
said O
the O
Cinema O
- O
owner O
by O
way O
of O
greeting O
. O

Then O
he O
handed O
us O
the O
passports B-TER
and O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
Fritz B-PER
, O
then O
he O
wished O
us O
luck O
and O
said O
goodbye O
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
also O
said O
that O
Fritz B-PER
could O
unfortunately O
not O
accompany O
us O
to O
the O
border O
, O
as O
he O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
Prague B-LOC
imminently O
. O

He O
also O
advised O
us O
to O
ask O
our O
host O
to O
drive O
to O
our O
train B-TER
early O
, O
so O
we O
would O
n’t O
have O
to O
drag O
our O
case O
there O
ourselves O
, O
as O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
long O
way O
away O
. O

Then O
Mutz O
and O
I O
went O
back O
to O
our O
room B-TER
and O
, O
first O
of O
all O
, O
read O
the O
letter B-TER
. O

Madams O
, O
I O
have O
enclosed O
the O
Hungarianvisa O
and O
some O
money O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
accompany O
you O
any O
further O
, O
as O
I O
have O
important O
things O
to O
take O
care O
of O
, O
but O
do O
not O
worry O
, O
everything O
will O
go O
smoothly O
. O

I O
am O
sending O
you O
some O
10 O
Mark O
notes O
, O
take O
them O
with O
you O
. O

Tomorrow O
morning O
you O
will O
travel O
to O
Bratislava O
, O
unfortunately O
you O
will O
have O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
there O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
, O
as O
your O
train O
to O
Budapest O
does O
not O
depart O
until O
after O
midnight O
. O

Get O
second O
- O
class O
tickets O
and O
, O
in O
Budapest O
, O
your O
friends O
will O
provide O
further O
help O
. O

The O
best O
way O
to O
get O
the O
money O
over O
the O
border O
will O
be O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
piece O
of O
dark O
- O
coloured O
cloth O
and O
hide O
it O
between O
the O
seats O
in O
an O
empty O
compartment O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O
will O
have O
any O
difficulty O
with O
this O
as O
the O
train O
will O
definitely O
be O
empty O
. O

So O
, O
do O
not O
worry O
, O
everything O
will O
go O
according O
to O
plan O
. O

You O
can O
retrieve O
the O
money O
at O
the O
border O
and O
exchange O
it O
in O
Budapest O
. O

I O
think O
that O
is O
all O
. O

Please O
destroy O
this O
letter O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
have O
read O
it O
. O

I O
ca O
n’t O
do O
this O
, O
Mutz O
said O
, O
in O
despair O
, O
he O
said O
he O
would O
get O
us O
safely O
across O
the O
border O
! O
I O
’ll O
try O
and O
get O
across O
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n’t O
do O
that O
thing O
with O
the O
money O
! O
Obviously O
, O
we O
had O
both O
envisioned O
it O
all O
quite O
differently O
, O
he O
had O
indeed O
promised O
us O
many O
times O
that O
he O
would O
take O
us O
over O
the O
border O
himself O
, O
and O
now O
he O
had O
just O
written O
a O
letter B-TER
saying O
we O
should O
smuggle B-TER
money B-TER
over O
the O
border O
– O
what O
were O
we O
paying O
him O
so O
much O
money B-TER
for O
; O
why O
had O
we O
given O
him O
such O
a O
large O
sum B-TER
the O
day O
before O
? O
But O
we O
had O
to O
get O
away O
from O
there O
, O
at O
any O
price O
, O
and O
we O
could O
not O
go O
back O
anymore O
. O

So O
, O
we O
really O
did O
not O
have O
a O
choice O
. O
