The O
person O
in O
question O
has O
given O
us O
the O
following O
information O
: O
Approximately O
4000 O
Jews O
lived O
in O
Nagyszöllős B-LOC
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
craftsmen O
and O
tradesmen O
, O
but O
there O
were O
doctors B-TER
and O
a O
lawyer B-TER
and O
an O
engineer O
too O
. O

They O
were O
not O
rich O
, O
but O
everybody O
lived O
decently O
. O

I O
lived O
with O
my O
mother O
and O
one O
of O
my O
sisters O
under O
modest O
financial O
circumstances O
. O

The O
first O
antisemitic B-TER
measures I-TER
were O
issued O
in O
March B-TER
1939 I-TER
. O

My O
mother O
owned O
a O
tobacconist O
’s O
shop O
, O
which O
was O
seized B-TER
immediately O
. O

The O
shops O
were O
confiscated B-TER
from O
other O
people O
as O
well O
, O
and O
from O
that O
time O
on O
our O
living O
was O
getting O
worse O
. O

Chief B-TER
notary I-TER
János B-PER
Kristofori I-PER
issued O
these O
decrees O
and O
György B-PER
Koflonovits I-PER
harassed O
the O
Jews O
, O
including O
me O
. O

He O
forced O
my O
boss O
to O
fire O
me O
, O
so O
I O
was O
laid O
off O
. O

The O
Jews O
could O
not O
protect O
themselves O
, O
because O
there O
was O
nobody O
we O
could O
turn O
to O
for O
help O
. O

Sunday O
morning O
, O
on O
April O
23 O
, O
1944 O
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
out O
to O
the O
street O
. O

This O
situation O
lasted O
for O
a O
week O
, O
during O
which O
they O
were O
constantly O
searching O
for O
money O
and O
valuables O
. O

After O
that O
we O
went O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
only O
with O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
underwear B-TER
and O
one O
set O
of O
clothes B-TER
. O

Before O
locking O
the O
ghetto B-TER
up O
, O
the O
military B-TER
gendarmes B-TER
and O
the O
leventes O
ordered O
us O
once O
more O
to O
hand O
over O
our O
jewellery O
and O
money O
, O
because O
- O
as O
they O
said O
- O
we O
would O
not O
need O
them O
any O
more O
as O
we O
would O
be O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
local O
Gentile O
residents O
were O
watching O
our O
misery O
and O
laughing O
at O
us O
, O
which O
I O
could O
never O
forget O
. O

The O
ghetto B-TER
was O
surrounded O
by O
a O
fence O
. O

Some O
flats O
had O
10 O
families O
living B-TER
in O
them O
and O
therefore O
the O
ghetto B-TER
was O
terribly O
crowded O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Council I-TER
cared O
about O
nothing O
. O

Once O
I O
escaped B-TER
from O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
some O
food B-TER
for O
my O
mother B-TER
, O
but O
the O
gendarmes B-TER
captured O
and O
beat O
me O
up O
seriously O
. O

After O
six O
days O
we O
set O
off O
. O

By O
this O
time O
many O
Jews O
had O
already O
died B-TER
or O
committed O
suicide B-TER
. O

We O
were O
not O
given O
food B-TER
at O
all O
and O
we O
were O
driven O
like O
animals O
, O
pushed O
and O
thrown O
into O
the O
freight O
cars O
. O

There O
were O
80 O
people B-TER
in O
a O
cattle B-TER
car I-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
car O
being O
responsible O
for O
everybody O
. O

Escaping B-TER
from O
the O
freight O
car O
would O
have O
been O
possible O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
mother O
. O

We O
travelled O
for O
ten O
days O
and O
during O
that O
time O
we O
were O
given O
water O
only O
three O
times O
. O

The O
Hungarians B-TER
escorted O
us O
until O
we O
reached O
Kassa B-LOC
where O
the O
Germans B-TER
took O
us O
over O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
that O
they O
expected O
us O
to O
know O
where O
we O
were O
going O
and O
warned O
us O
that O
we O
would O
be O
given O
food B-TER
and O
payment O
based O
on O
our O
work O
performance O
. O

I O
was O
warned O
particularly O
. O

At O
some O
level O
we O
believed O
what O
we O
were O
told O
, O
because O
we O
did O
not O
expect O
what O
happened O
afterwards O
. O

After O
we O
arrived O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
the O
Poles B-TER
threw O
the O
children B-TER
and O
elderly B-TER
people I-TER
out O
of O
the O
freight O
cars O
, O
and O
I O
could O
hardly O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
mother O
and O
my O
sister O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
crying O
and O
moaning O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
would O
allow O
the O
families O
to O
stay O
together O
, O
we O
were O
separated O
. O

I O
have O
not O
seen O
my O
mother O
since O
then O
. O

Soon O
they O
started O
the O
selection B-TER
, O
during O
which O
they O
separated B-TER
the O
ill B-TER
from O
those O
who O
were O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
. O

We O
were O
taken O
into O
a O
washroom O
where O
they O
shaved O
our O
heads O
, O
disinfected O
us O
and O
gave O
us O
striped O
prisoner B-TER
’s O
clothes B-TER
. O

Still O
wet O
, O
with O
nothing O
but O
a O
dress O
on O
we O
were O
taken O
into O
a O
block B-TER
. O

There O
we O
were O
lying O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
board O
and O
because O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
we O
could O
not O
fall O
asleep O
despite O
our O
exhaustion O
. O

We O
were O
in O
this O
block B-TER
for O
three O
days O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
we O
arrived O
we O
were O
lined O
up O
for O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
that O
lasted O
from O
morning O
to O
night O
. O

We O
were O
not O
given O
anything O
to O
eat B-TER
at O
all O
for O
four O
days O
. O

People B-TER
were O
starving B-TER
and O
felt O
dizzy O
. O

We O
drank O
water O
like O
animals O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
we O
got O
soup B-TER
and O
200 O
grams O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

We O
were O
there O
for O
three O
weeks O
, O
and O
were O
constantly O
beaten O
. O

Selections B-TER
were O
performed O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Dr O
Mengele B-PER
came O
by O
taxi O
and O
started O
the O
selection B-TER
. O

He O
beckoned O
to O
himself O
those O
whom O
he O
disliked O
, O
and O
sent O
back O
those O
whom O
he O
needed O
. O

It O
happened O
to O
me O
once O
that O
the O
SS B-TER
soldier I-TER
standing O
next O
to O
him O
misunderstood O
his O
wave O
, O
grabbed O
my O
arm O
and O
took O
me O
away O
instead O
of O
my O
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
. O

But O
I O
managed O
to O
escape B-TER
through O
the O
window O
. O

Considering O
that O
during O
selections B-TER
we O
were O
naked O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
, O
but O
somehow O
I O
got O
clothes B-TER
and O
I O
escaped B-TER
into O
an O
unfamiliar O
block O
. O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
block O
9 O
, O
where O
the O
entire O
block O
had O
been O
emptied O
, O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
people B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
they O
had O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
900 O
people B-TER
. O

There O
was O
a O
block O
curfew B-TER
, O
when O
everyone O
went O
into O
his O
or O
her O
own O
block O
. O

Three O
dumper O
trucks O
with O
trailers O
entered O
and O
they O
started O
to O
throw O
us O
onto O
the O
carts O
irrespective O
of O
whether O
we O
were O
ill B-TER
, O
young B-TER
, O
strong O
or O
weak O
. O

I O
was O
in O
that O
group O
and O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
escape B-TER
was O
that O
I O
told O
them O
I O
was O
there O
to O
help O
them O
loading O
. O

I O
got O
in O
the O
truck O
, O
sat O
next O
to O
the O
driver O
and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

After O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
, O
we O
practically O
turned O
people B-TER
out O
from O
the O
car O
; O
if O
someone O
was O
not O
able O
to O
stand O
up O
, O
we O
threw O
him O
in O
. O

We O
undressed O
everybody O
, O
but O
as O
a O
beginner O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
the O
horrible O
things O
that O
came O
next O
. O

We O
unloaded O
the O
prisoners B-TER
and O
I O
had O
to O
watch O
as O
my O
friends O
, O
acquaintances O
and O
relatives O
were O
taken O
away O
, O
undressed O
and O
given O
soaps O
and O
towels O
. O

Finally O
we O
herded O
all O
the O
2000 O
people B-TER
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

They O
went O
in O
unsuspectingly O
and O
we O
locked O
every O
window O
from O
outside O
. O

They O
were O
expecting O
water O
running O
from O
the O
shower O
and O
then O
the O
gas B-TER
operator O
turned O
on O
the O
gas B-TER
. O

They O
were O
moaning O
and O
yelling O
as O
the O
gas B-TER
was O
torturing O
them O
. O

Mothers B-TER
had O
to O
see O
their O
children B-TER
die B-TER
. O

The O
strongest O
man B-TER
was O
able O
to O
bear O
it O
for O
six O
minutes O
. O

After O
six O
minutes O
we O
opened O
the O
doors O
and O
we O
faced O
a O
heap O
of O
dead B-TER
bodies O
. O

Then O
we O
started O
to O
throw O
the O
bodies B-TER
onto O
trams O
, O
as O
if O
we O
would O
shovel O
coal O
, O
and O
then O
took O
and O
put O
them O
into O
the O
ovens B-TER
. O

The O
burning B-TER
process O
took O
place O
there O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
with O
that O
work B-TER
unit I-TER
for O
three O
days O
, O
but O
this O
horrible O
work B-TER
was O
bordering O
on O
madness O
and O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
it O
anymore O
. O

I O
told O
the O
Kommandoführer B-TER
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
leave O
and O
he O
sent O
me O
to O
another O
crematorium B-TER
, O
because O
there O
were O
five O
of O
them O
. O

My O
work B-TER
was O
easier O
there O
, O
as O
my O
task O
was O
to O
drive O
, O
beat O
and O
chase O
people B-TER
. O

It O
happened O
that O
an O
entire O
transport B-TER
from O
Hungary B-LOC
had O
to O
be O
burnt B-TER
upon O
their O
arrival O
without O
any O
selection B-TER
. I-TER

Neither O
the O
young B-TER
nor O
the O
old O
could O
escape B-TER
. O

Our O
equipments O
were O
more O
modern O
. O

Two O
thousand O
people B-TER
were O
herded O
into O
a O
large O
hall O
, O
of O
course O
undressed O
, O
with O
soaps O
and O
towels O
. O

Then O
gas B-TER
came O
out O
of O
the O
nozzles O
. O

After O
the O
gas B-TER
killed B-TER
the O
people B-TER
, O
the O
automatic O
floor O
started O
to O
move O
and O
it O
threw O
the O
bodies B-TER
into O
the O
oven B-TER
underneath O
. O

That O
was O
a O
circle O
- O
shaped O
floor O
, O
which O
could O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
mechanically O
. O

When O
all O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
oven B-TER
, O
the O
next O
transport B-TER
arrived O
and O
it O
started O
all O
over O
again O
. O

The O
victims B-TER
were O
unsuspicious O
and O
thought O
that O
the O
others O
before O
them O
left O
the O
room O
through O
another O
door O
. O

The O
procedure O
continued O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
worked B-TER
there O
for O
six O
days O
and O
then O
one O
of O
my O
acquaintances O
sent O
me O
into O
an O
infirmary B-TER
. O

People B-TER
working B-TER
there O
were O
generally O
not O
kept O
for O
more O
than O
24 O
hours O
, O
because O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
crematorium B-TER
. O

We O
lived O
quite O
separated O
, O
and O
I O
managed O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
another O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
block O
19 O
where O
1200 O
of O
us O
stayed O
for O
about O
five O
to O
six O
days O
. O

Our O
food B-TER
was O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
some O
soup B-TER
. O

From O
there O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

I O
received O
my O
first O
prisoner B-TER
number O
there O
and O
I O
was O
taken O
into O
a O
block O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
we O
cleared O
rubble O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
in I-LOC
Warsaw I-LOC
. O

We O
demolished O
the O
remaining O
walls O
, O
cleaned O
the O
bricks O
. O

What O
we O
produced O
was O
sent O
to O
Berlin B-LOC
. I-LOC

I O
worked B-TER
together O
with O
young O
men B-TER
from O
Nagyszőllős B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
were O
looking O
for O
a O
barber O
and O
since O
I O
knew O
how O
to O
shave O
, O
I O
was O
picked O
. O

I O
immediately O
shaved O
one O
of O
them O
. O

That O
was O
a O
very O
good O
position O
and O
my O
food B-TER
supply I-TER
was O
better O
as O
well O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
was O
given O
marmalade B-TER
or O
margarine B-TER
. O

Thus O
I O
could O
help O
the O
other O
men B-TER
from O
my O
hometown O
. O

Life O
went O
on O
like O
this O
for O
three O
months O
. O

After O
that O
there O
was O
a O
terrible O
retreat O
. O

About O
5000 O
people B-TER
were O
driven B-TER
on I-TER
foot I-TER
towards O
a O
destination O
130 O
kilometres O
away O
. O

We O
marched B-TER
30 O
kilometres O
a O
day O
in O
heavy O
rain O
. O

For O
the O
whole O
journey O
we O
received O
only O
one O
third O
of O
a O
loaf O
of O
bread B-TER
. O

Each O
of O
us O
had O
to O
carry O
three O
blankets O
. O

We O
had O
to O
sleep O
on O
those O
wet O
, O
completely O
soaked B-TER
blankets I-TER
under O
the O
open O
sky O
, O
in O
pouring O
rain O
. O

We O
were O
entrained O
at O
a O
place O
130 O
kilometres O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
beat O
and O
chase O
us O
again O
. O

Later O
we O
suffered O
from O
the O
terribly O
hot O
weather O
and O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
water O
for O
four O
days O
. O

On O
the O
fifth O
day O
we O
reached O
a O
river O
. O

When O
people B-TER
saw O
the O
water O
, O
they O
got O
completely O
wild O
, O
ran O
into O
the O
water O
and O
drank O
that O
filthy O
and O
dirty O
water O
full O
of O
seaweed O
like O
crazy O
. O

We O
did O
not O
want O
to O
come O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
so O
the O
SS B-TER
began O
to O
drive O
us O
out O
, O
naturally O
, O
by O
shooting O
at O
us O
. O

Among O
many O
others O
, O
my O
friend O
standing O
next O
to O
me O
was O
shot B-TER
. O

When O
the O
SS B-TER
noticed O
that O
his O
blood O
formed O
a O
stripe O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O
, O
but O
he O
was O
still O
alive O
, O
they O
kept O
trampling O
him O
down O
until O
he O
drowned B-TER
. O

We O
already O
had O
been O
so O
apathetic O
that O
things O
like O
that O
had O
only O
a O
little O
effect O
on O
us O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
reached O
the O
freight O
cars O
, O
we O
had O
been O
totally O
exhausted O
. O

For O
example O
, O
one O
of O
my O
townsmen O
died B-TER
of O
thirst O
in O
the O
lap O
of O
his O
son B-TER
. O

He O
was O
moaning O
and O
begging O
for O
water O
, O
but O
we O
could O
not O
help O
him O
. O

That O
man B-TER
even O
tore O
his O
gold O
teeth O
out O
of O
his O
own O
mouth O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
the O
SS B-TER
guards O
, O
but O
despite O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
. O

The O
capos B-TER
were O
our O
murderers B-TER
and O
hurried O
our O
death B-TER
. O

They O
beat O
and O
killed B-TER
people O
with O
stakes O
. O

After O
travelling O
for O
six O
days O
without O
food B-TER
and O
water O
we O
arrived O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
got O
off O
the O
freight O
car O
, O
14 O
out O
of O
60 O
people B-TER
had O
already O
been O
dead B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
leave O
behind O
everything O
we O
had O
, O
even O
our O
blankets O
. O

Being O
hardly O
able O
to O
walk O
, O
we O
were O
carried O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
stretchers O
, O
and O
as O
usual O
, O
we O
were O
disinfected O
. O

There O
we O
were O
given O
black O
coffee B-TER
and O
a O
little O
bread B-TER
in O
the O
morning O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
as O
well O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Dachau B-LOC
for O
14 O
days O
and O
then O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Buchenwald B-LOC
, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
receive O
us O
there O
. O

After O
staying O
there O
for O
two O
days O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

The O
situation O
there O
was O
similar O
as O
in O
the O
other O
camps B-TER
. O

We O
were O
assigned O
to O
work B-TER
in O
a O
stone O
quarry O
near O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

The O
work B-TER
was O
terribly O
hard O
and O
people B-TER
were O
dying B-TER
off O
daily O
. O

In O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
there O
were O
too O
many O
of O
us O
, O
so O
the O
Lagerführer B-TER
gave O
an O
order O
to O
the O
capos B-TER
and O
the O
Kommandoführer B-TER
saying O
look O
, O
here O
is O
the O
commando O
, O
bring O
home O
10 O
- O
20 O
people O
dead O
. O

Whether O
they O
wanted O
or O
not O
, O
they O
had O
to O
beat O
some O
people B-TER
to O
death B-TER
. O

The O
Lagerführer O
came O
in O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
to O
count O
how O
many O
people B-TER
had O
been O
actually O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
spite O
of O
those O
acts O
there O
were O
still O
too O
many O
prisoners B-TER
, O
as O
far O
as O
they O
judged O
. O

Therefore O
we O
were O
sent O
further O
to O
Gross B-LOC
Rosen I-LOC
. O

That O
camp B-TER
was O
on O
the O
top O
of O
a O
high O
mountain O
, O
and O
in O
order O
to O
get O
there O
we O
had O
to O
climb O
stairs O
. O

We O
stayed O
there O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
. O

We O
were O
at O
such O
a O
great O
height O
, O
that O
even O
going O
for O
our O
breakfast B-TER
was O
hard O
. O

We O
would O
have O
rather O
not O
had O
food B-TER
than O
go O
up O
this O
height O
. O

On O
these O
occasions O
the O
capos B-TER
started O
to O
do O
their O
job O
, O
and O
until O
they O
collected O
six O
people B-TER
to O
send O
for O
lunch B-TER
, O
they O
had O
beaten O
20 O
people B-TER
to O
death B-TER
, O
because O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
walk O
any O
more O
. O

Capos B-TER
hit O
people B-TER
so O
hard O
that O
they O
fell O
and O
he O
continued O
the O
beating O
until O
their O
victims O
died B-TER
at O
their O
feet O
. O

After O
two O
miserable O
weeks O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Mühldorf B-LOC
. O

A O
so O
- O
called O
Hauptbaustelle O
( O
main O
construction O
site O
) O
was O
being O
built O
here O
. O

It O
needed O
a O
lot O
of O
workforce B-TER
: O
about O
5000 O
- O
6000 O
of O
us O
worked B-TER
there O
. O

My O
job B-TER
was O
carrying O
cement O
. O

I O
had O
to O
carry O
50 O
- O
kilogram O
cement O
bags O
up O
to O
the O
mixers O
. O

People B-TER
became O
incapable O
of O
working B-TER
on O
daily O
basis O
. O

We O
worked B-TER
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
. O

Later O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O

The O
Lagerältesters B-TER
were O
criminals O
sentenced B-TER
to O
10 O
- O
15 O
years O
for O
murder B-TER
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
were O
appointed O
as O
our O
lords O
and O
they O
became O
our O
gods O
. O

As O
I O
have O
told O
before O
, O
I O
became O
a O
cook O
. O

One O
time O
at O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
they O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
cook O
, O
so O
I O
applied O
. O

I O
was O
assigned O
to O
this O
job O
. O

I O
was O
doing O
relatively O
well O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
could O
be O
good O
to O
see O
my O
fellow O
prisoners B-TER
starving B-TER
and O
to O
be O
unable O
to O
help O
them O
. O

I O
was O
there O
until O
I O
fell O
ill B-TER
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

Then O
I O
was O
locked O
up O
in O
a O
quarantine O
camp B-TER
and O
stayed O
there O
until O
April O
25 O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
greatest O
crisis O
I O
was O
lying O
ill O
in O
bed O
with O
a O
fever B-TER
of O
40 O
- O
41.6 O
degrees O
Celsius O
. O

Two O
of O
my O
companions B-TER
came O
for O
me O
, O
because O
our O
camp B-TER
was O
evacuated B-TER
and O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
me O
behind O
. O

Otherwise O
I O
would O
not O
have O
survived O
, O
as O
those O
who O
stayed O
behind O
were O
finished O
off O
. O

The O
boys B-TER
took O
me O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
smuggled O
me O
out O
. O

I O
travelled O
for O
six O
days O
still O
having O
a O
high B-TER
fever I-TER
until O
we O
managed O
to O
reach B-TER
the I-TER
Americans I-TER
. O

They O
assembled O
us O
there O
, O
and O
I O
was O
taken O
to O
hospital B-TER
and O
got O
over O
the O
typhus B-TER
. I-TER

I O
was O
there O
until O
I O
fully O
recovered O
. O

We O
received O
food B-TER
parcels O
, O
clothes B-TER
and O
everything O
we O
needed O
. O

I O
can O
not O
find O
my O
mother B-TER
and O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
live O
at O
home O
without O
her O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to B-TER
go I-TER
to O
Palestine B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
