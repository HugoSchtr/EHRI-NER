A O
revivication O
of O
the O
Iron O
Guardmovement O
did O
not O
eventuate O
; O
rather O
, O
the O
legionary O
leaders O
have B-TER
been I-TER
shot I-TER
and O
the O
movement B-TER
’s I-TER
strength O
, O
both O
actual O
and O
potential O
, O
is O
greatly O
diminished O
. O

But O
the O
Nazi B-TER
shadow O
still O
looms O
large O
. O

Whether O
the O
German B-TER
threat B-TER
is O
a O
controlling O
or O
only O
a O
contributory O
factor O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
plight O
of O
the O
Jews B-TER
in O
this O
country O
has O
grown O
worse O
and O
their O
fears B-TER
are O
greatly O
increased O
. O

The O
Government B-TER
can O
scarcely O
be O
called O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
Goga B-PER
Government B-TER
a O
year O
ago O
, O
strongly O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Semitic I-TER
, O
but O
it O
‘ O
recognizes O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
Jewish B-TER
problem I-TER
’ O
and O
many O
are O
constrained O
to O
feel O
that O
although O
the O
Goga B-PER
and O
Cuza B-PER
program O
was O
openly O
and O
violently O
anti B-TER
- I-TER
Jewish I-TER
the O
actual O
effect O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
and O
methods O
employed O
by O
the O
present O
regime B-TER
is O
more O
severe O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
out O
- O
and O
- O
out O
pogrom B-TER
and O
that O
Governmental B-TER
regulation B-TER
of I-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
is O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
relatively O
slight O
, O
but O
pressure O
, O
obstacles O
, O
discriminations B-TER
– O
all O
of O
these O
forms O
of O
persecution B-TER
are O
becoming O
noticeably O
more O
numerous O
. O

[ O

The O
attitude B-TER
of O
the O
Romanian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
, O
then O
, O
that O
this O
surplus O
population B-TER
of O
non B-TER
- I-TER
citizen I-TER
Jews B-TER
must O
go O
; O
there O
is O
to O
be O
no O
pogrom B-TER
, O
no O
violence O
, O
no O
brutality O
, O
but O
they B-TER
must I-TER
go I-TER
. O

Until O
a O
place O
is O
found O
for O
them O
and O
an O
arrangement O
is O
made O
for O
them O
to O
get O
there O
they O
will O
probably O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

As O
to O
the O
others O
, O
the O
800,000 O
who O
have O
established O
their O
citizenship B-TER
, O
the O
Government B-TER
points O
to O
their O
citizenship B-TER
as O
a O
guarantee O
of O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
accorded O
to O
others O
, O
although O
admitting O
that O
Jews B-TER
‘ O
will O
probably O
not O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
higher B-TER
positions I-TER
’ O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
The O
Romanians B-TER
are O
not O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
a O
harsh O
or O
vindictive O
people B-TER
; O
they O
are O
, O
rather O
, O
tolerant O
and O
easy O
- O
going O
. O

I O
feel O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
although O
the O
program O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
what O
are O
termed O
the O
‘ O
surplus O
’ O
Jews B-TER
will O
probably O
in O
any O
case O
be O
retained O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
likelihood O
of O
such O
a O
degree O
of O
violence O
or O
severity O
being O
employed O
as O
would O
call O
down O
strong O
criticism B-TER
or I-TER
general I-TER
protest I-TER
from O
the O
outside B-TER
world I-TER
