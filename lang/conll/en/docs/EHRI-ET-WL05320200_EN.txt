We O

The O
Polish B-TER

who O

starved B-TER
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
stand O
on O
their O

. O

They O
told O
us O
that O
they O
have O
n’t O
had O
anything O

three O
days O

The O
Germans B-TER

They O

I O

there O
were O
also O
many O
refugees B-TER
from O
Różan B-LOC
and O
other O
surrounding O

. O

In O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
we O
spent O
3 O
weeks O
– O
from O
Sunday O
, O
September O
10 O
, O
until O
Shabbat O
Chol O
- O
Hamoed O
Sukkot O
Shabbat O
on O
the O
intermediate O
days O
during O
Sukkot O
. O

( O
September O
30 O
) O
. O

During O
the O
whole O
time O
, O
we O
were O
tortured B-TER
indescribably O
. O

Roll O
calls O
were O
called O
upon O
ten O
times O
per O
day O
and O
every O
time O
they O
would O
take O
photographs B-TER
of O
those O
with O
beards O
, O
dusty O
Probably O
meant O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
backward O
and O
poor O
. O

Jews O
, O
the O
shabby O
suffering O
victims B-TER
. O

When O
exiting O
the O
barracks O
after O
having O
crumbs O
of O
bread B-TER
, O
they O
would O
very O
often O
entertain O
themselves O
with O
us O
, O
chasing O
us O
, O
beating O
etc O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
they O
used O
to O
take O
the O
crowd O
to O
work B-TER
. O

They O
treated O
the O
Poles B-TER
not O
much O
better O
than O
us O
but O
they O
usually O
did O
not O
torture B-TER
them O
. O

Every O
barrack O
had O
its O
very O
own O
commander O
from O
among O
the O
internees O
proper O
. O

With O
us O
there O
was O
a O
Jew O
from O
Stawiski B-LOC
. O

He O
was O
responsible O
for O
keeping O
the O
order O
in O
the O
barrack O
. O

He O
also O
had O
to O
mediate O
between O
us O
and O
the O
camp B-LOC
commander O
’s O
office O
. O

But O
as O
long O
as O
the O
young O
soldiers B-TER
kept O
watch O
over O
us O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
miserable O
like O
death O
. O

We O
used O
to O
complain O
via O
our O
commander O
, O
that O
we O
are O
robbed B-TER
of O
everything O
, O
but O
that O
did O
not O
help O
at O
all O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
literally O
barefoot O
and O
in O
underwear O
. O

The O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
adjacent O
32nd O
barrack O
, O
as O
mentioned O
before O
, O
took O
away O
all O
our O
clothes B-TER
, O
the O
shoes O
and O
even O
the O
paillasses O
. O

We O
started O
to O
cut O
the O
remaining O
paillasses O
into O
bast O
shoes O
which O
we O
used O
to O
wrap O
around O
our O
naked O
feet O
. O

We O
were O
also O
wearing O
paillasses O
as O
clothes O
. O

One O
week O
after O
our O
arrival O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
they O
changed O
our O
guards O
. O

Other O
Germans B-TER
arrived O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
– O
older O
and O
demure O
ones O
who O
treated O
us O
a O
little O
more O
humane O
. O

The O
main O
accomplishment O
of O
the O
new O
guards O
was O
that O
they O
summoned O
the O
bandits O
of O
the O
adjacent O
32nd O
barrack O
to O
give O
back O
the O
looted B-TER
things I-TER
. O

A O
part O
of O
the O
clothes B-TER
were O
indeed O
returned O
to O
us O
: O
jackets B-TER
, O
sweaters B-TER
, O
shoes B-TER
etc O
. O

Whoever O
did O
not O
return O
the O
things O
on O
his O
own O
was O
forced O
by O
the O
guards O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
. O

If O
someone O
pointed O
out O
that O
somebody O
was O
wearing O
robbed B-TER
clothes O
, O
the O
commander O
used O
to O
stop O
this O
person O
immediately O
and O
to O
take O
off O
the O
clothes B-TER
of O
him O
. O

The O
strongest O
boys O
of O
the O
32nd O
barrack O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
resist O
this O
time O
. O

Incited O
to O
loot B-TER
by O
the O
young O
Hitlerites B-TER
, O
they O
were O
now O
forced O
by O
the O
old O
German B-TER
soldiers B-TER
to O
return O
the O
little O
clothes B-TER
they O
had O
robbed B-TER
. O

Irrespective O
of O
that O
, O
we O
were O
dirty O
and O
full O
of O
lice O
because O
we O
were O
not O
provided O
with O
a O
bath O
. O

And O
the O
shirts B-TER
we O
were O
wearing O
for O
5 O
weeks O
straight O
. O

On O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
they O
started O
to O
compile O
lists O
of O
boys O
under O
17 O
and O
older O
men O
over O
45 O
. O

Doctors B-TER
were O
also O
coming O
, O
and O
inspected O
those O
persons O
who O
indicated O
that O
they O
are O
sick B-TER
. O

Of O
the O
weak O
and O
sick B-TER
special O
lists O
were O
compiled O
. O

The O
preparation O
of O
the O
lists O
took O
until O
Yom O
Kippur O
. O

Between O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
and O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
Polish B-TER
police B-ORG
, O
train O
officials O
, O
officers O
etc O
. O

arrived O
in O
camp B-LOC
. O

In O
the O
Days O
of O
Awe O
, O
we O
almost O
did O
not O
pray O
at O
all O
. O

On O
Rosh O
Hashanah O
, O
we O
got O
up O
to O
pray O
at O
6 O
am O
but O
until O
we O
got O
to O
shakhres O
Morning O
prayer O
. O

we O
were O
taken O
aside O
for O
a O
roll O
call O
. O

On O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
our O
laments O
were O
immense O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
to O
work B-TER
that O
day O
. O

A O
few O
Germans B-TER
came O
to O
us O
into O
the O
barrack O
to O
hear O
us O
pray O
. O

They O
did O
not O
ridicule O
us O
. O

Approximately O
30 O
secular O
Jews O
volunteered O
to O
work B-TER
in O
order O
to O
free O
up O
from O
work B-TER
those O
who O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

After O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
they O
started O
to O
send O
Poles B-TER
en O
masse O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Germany B-TER
. O

They O
were O
first O
bathed O
and O
then O
send O
away O
. O

We O
did O
not O
have O
any O
cigarettes O
, O
and O
soon O
a O
tobacco O
trade B-TER
developed O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
. O

Individuals O
who O
had O
money O
were O
secretly O
buying O
tobacco O
from O
the O
guard O
and O
making O
cigarettes O
. O

For O
one O
cigarette O
, O
one O
had O
to O
pay O
2 O
Złoty O
. O

Only O
later O
, O
it O
started O
to O
get O
cheaper O
and O
it O
dropped O
to O
30 O
grosz O
. O

After O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
they O
gathered O
the O
Jews O
and O
special O
speakers O
were O
giving O
speeches O
for O
us O
that O
we O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
Russian O
– O
the O
Germans B-TER
do O
not O
want O
to O
have O
us O
. O

To O
the O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
territories O
that O
were O
occupied O
by O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
speeches O
were O
given O
that O
, O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
go O
home O
, O
they O
would O
be O
released O
– O
but O
those O
who O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Germany B-TER
could O
stay O
and O
work O
for O
4 O
Mark O
a O
day O
. O

The O
majority O
wanted O
to O
return O
home O
, O
however O
. O

2 O
peasants O
escaped O
from O
everything O
on O
their O
own O
, O
but O
they O
were O
caught O
and O
shot B-TER
. O

They O
were O
buried B-TER
together O
with O
the O
young O
man O
Reytshik B-PER
from O
Różan B-LOC
, O
who O
died B-TER
of O
too O
much O
food B-TER
. O

The O
story O
with O
him O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
Once O
a O
landowner O
from O
Tannenberg B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Olsztynek I-LOC
] I-LOC
entered O
the O
camp B-LOC
and O
took O
around O
one O
hundred O
Jews O
to O
work B-TER
for O
him O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
he O
took O
workers B-TER
again O
. O

This O
repeated O
itself O
several O
times O
. O

There O
were O
also O
several O
times O
when O
they O
took O
Jews O
. O

Later O
they O
stopped O
taking O
Jews O
. O

The O
returnees O
from O
work B-TER
used O
to O
feel O
happy O
because O
the O
landowner O
used O
to O
give O
them O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TER
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
Reytshik B-PER
overate B-TER
himself O
and O
his O
intestines O
turned O
. O

The O
last O
week O
of O
our O
time O
in O
the O
camp B-LOC
, O
they O
brought O
to O
us O
to O
the O
camp B-LOC
several O
hundred O
Jewish O
soldiers B-TER
from O
the O
Polish B-TER
army B-TER
. O

They O
were O
housed O
in O
a O
special O
barrack O
. O

On O
Thursday O
, O
28 O
September O
, O
they O
started O
to O
gather O
signatures O
from O
all O
interned O
Jews O
and O
Poles B-TER
from O
the O
territories O
, O
which O
were O
occupied O
by O
the O
Bolsheviks B-TER
, O
that O
we O
reject O
the O
right O
to O
German B-TER
citizenship B-TER
and O
that O
we O
will O
depart O
to O
the O
mentioned O
territories O
very O
soon O
. O

On O
Shabbat O
, O
September O
30 O
at O
7 O
am O
, O
we O
were O
gathered O
according O
to O
our O
hometowns O
. O

In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day O
, O
one O
group O
after O
the O
other O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
train B-TER
. O

There O
, O
we O
were O
crammed O
into O
railroad B-TER
cars I-TER
for I-TER
horses I-TER
and O
sent O
off O
without O
any O
food B-TER
. O

On O
Shabbat O
at O
night O
, O
the O
train B-TER
stopped O
and O
we O
kept O
there O
like O
that O
until O
Sunday O
morning O
– O
all O
of O
that O
without O
food B-TER
. O

Our O
laments O
did O
not O
help O
. O

Somebody O
found O
a O
few O
heads O
of O
cabbage B-TER
. O

So O
we O
snatched O
it O
up O
and O
ate B-TER
it O
raw O
. O

On O
Sunday O
at O
10 O
am O
, O
we O
were O
finally O
ordered O
to O
leave O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
we O
were O
in O
Ostrołęka B-LOC
. O

Before O
they O
let O
us O
out O
into O
freedom O
, O
several O
individuals O
lost O
consciousness O
due O
to O
the O
hunger B-TER
, O
among O
them O
– O
also O
my O
cousin B-TER
Sh O
. O

Z. O
, O
that O
is O
my O
cousin B-TER
’s I-TER
husband B-TER
. O

On O
Sunday O
morning O
, O
I O
arrived O
in O
Goworowo B-LOC
. O

The O
city O
was O
unrecognizable O
. O

Goworowo B-LOC
was O
burnt O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

I O
could O
not O
enter O
my O
house O
– O
surrounding O
it O
there O
were O
only O
chimneys O
standing O
. O

My O
family B-TER
spent O
the O
time O
outside O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

They O
told O
me O
that O
on O
the O
morning O
after O
we O
were O
led O
out O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
, O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
started O
to O
shoot O
into O
the O
houses O
and O
after O
that O
they O
set O
the O
city O
on O
fire O
with O
grenades O
. O

Then O
, O
approximately O
80 O
Jews B-TER
died I-TER
. O

Close O
to O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
were O
chased O
by O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
into O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
set O
them O
on O
fire O
but O
some O
officer O
rescued O
the O
Jews O
. O

Since O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
was O
already O
packed O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
standing O
outside O
, O
but O
the O
soldiers B-TER
were O
shooting O
at O
them O
with O
rifles O
and O
many O
Jews B-TER
died I-TER
this O
way O
. O

After O
rescuing O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
beys B-LOC
- I-LOC
hamedresh I-LOC
from O
certain O
death B-TER
, O
the O
young O
people O
were O
chased O
to O
Hohenstein B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Olsztynek I-LOC
] I-LOC
where O
I O
was O
at O
, O
and O
all O
remaining O
people O
– O
including O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
( O
even O
infants B-TER
) O
– O
were O
held O
on O
a O
field O
. O

They O
ate B-TER
beets B-TER
, O
[ O
unclear O
] O
etc O
. O

The O
elder O
Jews O
, O
who O
were O
sent O
home O
– O
as O
I O
have O
already O
mentioned O
– O
from O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
road O
soon O
after O
our O
arrest B-TER
in O
Goworowo B-LOC
, O
were O
detained O
in O
a O
stable O
on O
their O
way O
home O
. O

And O
the O
Hitlerites B-TER
wanted O
to O
execute B-TER
them O
. O

Some O
peasant O
thankfully O
opened O
the O
stable O
for O
them O
in O
a O
moment O
when O
the O
Germans B-TER
were O
not O
there O
. O

And O
this O
way O
they O
survived O
. O

Once O
they O
gathered O
approximately O
50 O
Jews O
together O
with O
the O
rabbi B-TER
from O
the O
fields O
outside O
Goworowo B-LOC
and O
tortured B-TER
them O
terribly O
. O

One O
person O
was O
placed O
with O
his O
head O
on O
a O
log O
and O
an O
axe O
was O
lifted O
above O
his O
head O
. O

They O
did O
not O
chop B-TER
off I-TER
his I-TER
head I-TER
, O
only O
his O
beard B-TER
. O

Later O
they O
shaved B-TER
off I-TER
the I-TER
beards I-TER
of O
everyone O
. O

Only O
the O
rabbi B-TER
could O
keep O
his O
beard B-TER
. O

Two O
days O
after O
my O
arrival O
at O
