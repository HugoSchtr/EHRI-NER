10–18 O
On O
October O
24 O
, O
1941 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
invaded O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
convey O
the O
horror O
that O
I O
was O
seized O
by O
. O

Yet O
, O
the O
desperate O
situation O
forced O
me O
, O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
, O
to O
stay O
in O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

The O
Fascist B-TER
demonstrated O
what O
they O
were O
capable O
of O
already O
on O
the O
very O
first O
day O
. O

On O
the O
squares B-LOC
, O
Soviet B-TER
people O
were O
hanging B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
started O
to O
rob B-TER
. O

One O
was O
not O
able O
to O
sit O
at O
home O
. O

Every O
moment O
, O
you O
could O
hear O
a O
knock O
on O
the O
door O
: O
Open O
up O
! O
They B-TER
usually I-TER
took I-TER
everything I-TER
– O
food B-TER
, O
clothes B-TER
. O

After O
that O
, O
they O
started O
to O
take O
hostages B-TER
. O

The O
hotel O
International O
was O
packed O
with O
unfortunate O
victims B-TER
. O

The O
windows O
were O
shattered O
, O
the O
rooms O
over O
- O
crowded O
– O
no O
place O
for O
laying O
or O
sitting O
down O
. O

During O
interrogations O
, O
they O
usually O
beat O
up O
the O
arrestees B-TER
. O

They O
were O
held O
for O
roughly O
ten O
days O
and O
then O
, O
already O
half O
- O
dead O
, O
shot B-TER
dead I-TER
. O

Once O
, O
a O
crowd O
assembled O
on O
the O

– O
there O
was O
a O
radio O
there O
. O

I O
passed O
by O
to O
get O
water O
. O

And O
suddenly O
we O
saw O
how O
from O
the O
highest O
floor O
of O
the O
building O
they O
let O
down O
a O
young O
man B-TER
on O
a O
rope B-TER
. O

At O
first O
we O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
it O
is O
. O

A O
heartrending O
cry O
was O
heard O
: O
Help O
! O
The O
unfortunate O
remained O
hanging B-TER
from I-TER
the I-TER
balcony I-TER
. O

The O
frightened O
crowd O
dispersed O
into O
all O
directions O
. O

This O
was O
the O
morning O
after O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
dream O
, O
as O
if O
my O
dream O
gave O
me O
a O
foreboding O
about O
the O
future O
. O

They O
demanded O
that O
my O
building B-LOC
provides O
10 O
Jews O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
among O
them O
. O

After O
the O
people O
finished O
the O
work B-TER
, O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
the O
International O
as O
hostages B-TER
. O

I O
began O
to O
wait O
for O
my O
turn O
. O

On O
December O
15 O
, O
they O
wanted O
all O
Jews O
of O
our O
building B-LOC
as O
hostages B-TER
. O

I O
decided O
that O
I O
wo O
n’t O
fall O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
murderers B-TER
alive O
and O
that O
I O
will O
commit B-TER
suicide I-TER
instead O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
poison O
, O
but O
I O
found O
a O
razorblade O
. O

Ten O
times O
I O
cut O
my O
wrist O
with O
the O
blade O
, O
but O
due O
to O
my O
inexperience O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
reach O
the O
vein O
. O

From O
the O
loss O
of O
blood O
I O
lost O
consciousness O
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
from O
a O
knock O
at O
the O
door O
. O

They O
notified O
me O
that O
today O
is O
December O
15 O
, O
1941 O
: O
all O
Jews O
are O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O
city B-LOC
and O
move O
into O
the O
barracks O
which O
are O
behind O
the O
tractor B-TER
factory I-TER
– O
12 O
kilometres O
away O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

The O
blood O
ran O
from O
my O
wound O
, O
I O
hardly O
understood O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
describe O
the O
image O
– O
15 O
thousand O
people O
, O
or O
even O
more O
, O
walked O
on O
Staro B-LOC
- I-LOC
Moskovsky I-LOC
Street I-LOC
to O
the O
tractor B-TER
factory I-TER
. O

Many O
of O
them O
carried O
things O
. O

There O
were O
sick B-TER
people O
, O
even O
paralysed O
ones O
. O

They O
were O
carried O
by O
others O
. O

The O
path O
from O
Staro B-LOC
- I-LOC
Moskovsky I-LOC
Street I-LOC
to O
the O
tractor B-TER
factory I-TER
was O
paved O
with O
dead B-TER
bodies I-TER
from O
old O
people O
, O
children B-TER
, O
and O
sick B-TER
people O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
our O
new O
domicile B-LOC
. O

I O
entered O
the O
barrack O
. O

Instead O
of O
windows O
, O
there O
were O
big O
holes O
without O
window O
panes O
. O

The O
doors O
could O
not O
be O
closed O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
to O
sit O
on O
. O

A O
ice O
- O
cold O
wind O
was O
blowing O
. O

I O
was O
weakened O
by O
the O
blood O
loss O
and O
fainted O
. O

I O
regained O
consciousness O
from O
a O
cry O
: O
a O
woman B-TER
with O
child B-TER
were O
crying O
. O

There O
were O
more O
and O
more O
people O
, O
it O
was O
very O
cramped O
, O
and O
in O
the O
darkness O
someone O
fell O
on O
top O
of O
the O
woman B-TER
with O
an O
infant O
. O

The O
baby B-TER
cried O
. O

When O
the O
mother B-TER
saw O
that O
the O
child B-TER
stopped O
moving O
, O
she O
started O
screaming O
: O
Help O
! O
This O
is O
all O
that O
is O
left O
to O
me O
– O
my O
husband O
and O
son O
were O
hanged O
. O

What O
could O
we O
do O
, O
though O
? O
Turning O
on O
the O
lights O
was O
prohibited O
. O

The O
baby B-TER
died O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
bad O
barrack O
. O

We O
were O
fifty O
people O
. O

Some O
were O
lucky O
– O
they O
bought O
bunk O
beds O
. O

On O
each O
bunk O
, O
5–6 O
men B-TER
were O
laying O
. O

It O
was O
bitterly O
cold O
. O

I O
slept O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

My O
hands O
and O
feet O
froze O
from O
the O
cold O
. O

Another O
misfortune O
was O
waiting O
for O
me O
. O

I O
have O
just O
one O
sister B-TER
. O

A O
long O
time O
ago O
, O
30 O
years O
to O
be O
exact O
, O
she O
converted O
to O
Christianity B-TER
and O
in O
her O
passport B-TER
she O
is O
registered O
as O
Russian B-TER
. O

I O
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
thought O
about O
the O
past O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
turned O
around O
, O
as O
if O
somebody O
pushed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
my O
only O
dear O
sister B-TER
. O

Four O
days O
, O
she O
sat O
with O
me O
in O
the O
barrack O
. O

There O
were O
good O
people O
around O
, O
who O
helped O
her O
, O
and O
she O
escaped B-TER
. O

She O
had O
a O
Russianpassport O
after O
all O
and O
it O
was O
easier O
to O
help O
her O
than O
me O
. O

We O
did O
not O
say O
goodbye O
properly O
, O
so O
she O
would O
not O
turn O
around O
. O

I O
only O
looked O
at O
her O
and O
wanted O
to O
hand O
over O
everything O
to O
her O
with O
this O
one O
look O
. O

The O
wound O
on O
my O
wrist O
did O
not O
close O
. O

I O
was O
suffering O
from O
the O
cold O
and O
from O
hunger B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
would O
usually O
let O
us O
go O
to O
the O
market O
or O
to O
get O
water O
if O
we O
gave O
things O
in O
return O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
continuously O
killed B-TER
people O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
a O
boy B-TER
was O
walking O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
yelled O
to O
him O
: O
Ey O
, O
Jude O
! O
When O
the O
boy B-TER
approached O
them O
, O
a O
German B-TER
threw O
him O
into O
a O
pit B-TER
and O
pressed O
his O
foot O
onto O
him O
, O
then O
he O
shot B-TER
him I-TER
dead I-TER
. O

Before O
the O
decree B-TER
was O
issued O
that O
everyone O
should O
be O
shot B-TER
, O
they O
usually O
killed B-TER
around O
fifty O
people O
every O
day O
. O

Once O
they O
announced O
: O
If O
we O
hear O
children O
cry O
during O
the O
night O
, O
we O
will O
shoot O
everyone O
. O

But O
how O
can O
you O
demand O
from O
a O
baby B-TER
not O
to O
cry O
? O
They O
could O
not O
be O
diapered O
, O
they O
were O
laying O
wet O
in O
the O
cold O
. O

The O
mothers B-TER
’ I-TER
milk O
had O
dried O
up O
from O
all O
the O
hardships O
, O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
nurse O
them O
with O
. O

I O
managed O
to O
change O
barracks O
– O
no O
. O

9 O
. O

This O
barrack O
was O
lucky O
: O
it O
was O
the O
last O
in O
line O
for O
the O
massacre B-TER
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
tried O
to O
swindle O
us O
into O
going O
to O
the O
massacre B-TER
. O

In O
the O
third O
week O
, O
they O
announced O
: O
those O
, O
who O
want O
to O
be O
drafted O
for O
work B-TER
in O
Poltava B-LOC
, O
Lubny B-LOC
and O
Romny B-LOC
, O
should O
go O
in O
front O
. O

It O
was O
as O
if O
a O
needle O
stung O
into O
my O
heart O
and O
I O
remembered O
my O
bad O
dream O
. O

800 O
men B-TER
signed O
up O
. O

I O
saw O
how O
they O
were O
put O
into O
trucks O
. O

They O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
anything O
. O

Soon O
enough O
, O
we O
heard O
a O
shootout B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
, O
they O
already O
no O
longer O
asked O
who O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

They O
snapped O
up O
women B-TER
, O
tore O
them O
away O
from O
their O
children B-TER
and O
threw O
them O
into O
the O
trucks O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
chased O
on O
foot O
. O

I O
gathered O
the O
last O
drop O
of O
strength O
and O
went O
into O
the O
adjacent O
barrack O
. O

I O
entered O
hell O
: O
dead B-TER
people I-TER
, O
dishes O
, O
down O
from O
the O
pillows O
, O
clothes B-TER
, O
food B-TER
, O
everything O
mixed O
up O
. O

In O
one O
corner O
, O
a O
dead O
woman B-TER
lay O
on O
a O
bed O
with O
her O
hand O
dangling O
, O
and O
a O
small O
child B-TER
was O
sucking O
on O
her O
dead O
fingers O
. O

In O
the O
other O
corner O
, O
a O
dead B-TER
old B-TER
man I-TER
was O
lying O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
quite O
remember O
how O
I O
made O
it O
to O
my O
barrack O
. O

I O
just O
really O
wanted O
to O
live O
. O

I O
envied O
a O
dog O
, O
a O
cat O
– O
they O
had O
the O
right O
to O
live O
, O
nobody O
hunted O
them O
down O
, O
and O
I O
, O
simply O
because O
I O
am O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
, O
I O
have O
to O
die B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
from O
the O
early O
morning O
hours O
, O
we O
sat O
and O
waited O
for O
our O
death B-TER
. O

Once O
, O
we O
had O
a O
moment O
of O
respite O
. O

From O
the O
direction O
of O
Saltiv B-LOC
, O
a O
cannon O
shootout B-TER
could O
be O
heard O
. O

The O
doomed O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
our O
army O
. O

They O
said O
: O
They O
will O
save O
us O
and O
embraced O
each O
other O
and O
cried O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
, O
I O
have O
strong O
nerves O
since O
I O
endured O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
day O
next O
to O
last O
arrived O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
a O
young O
pregnant O
woman B-TER
was O
brought O
into O
our O
barrack O
. O

When O
she O
learned O
that O
she O
will O
be O
killed B-TER
tomorrow O
together O
with O
everyone O
else O
, O
she O
started O
to O
be O
in O
labor O
. O

I O
could O
not O
sleep O
because O
of O
her O
cries O
. O

In O
this O
very O
night O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
run B-TER
away I-TER
. O

At O
dawn O
, O
I O
got O
ready O
. O

I O
put O
a O
bedsheet O
into O
the O
pocket O
of O
my O
coat B-TER
in O
order O
to O
bandage O
my O
wound O
again O
and O
went B-TER
off I-TER
. O

At O
every O
turn O
, O
there O
were O
Gestapo B-ORG
men I-ORG
with O
guns O
. O

What O
to O
do O
, O
where O
to O
go O
? O
They O
will O
kill B-TER
you O
either O
way O
… O
There O
was O
no O
time O
to O
think O
things O
through O
, O
every O
second O
was O
precious O
. O

Right O
this O
second O
, O
an O
officer O
called O
out O
to O
the O
soldiers B-TER
to O
sort O
through O
the O
things O
of O
the O
Jews O
which O
were O
lying O
on O
the O
truck O
. O

I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
crawled O
towards O
the O
ravine O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
turned O
around O
. O

I O
crawled O
into O
the O
snow O
and O
covered O
myself O
with O
the O
bedsheet O
. O

I O
lay O
like O
this O
on O
the O
frozen O
ground O
in O
minus O
forty O
degrees O
until O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
it O
dawned O
, O
I O
started O
to O
crawl O
and O
reached O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
ravine O
, O
with O
great O
effort O
I O
crawled O
all O
over O
. O

It O
was O
bitterly O
cold O
, O
and O
there O
were O
not O
patrols O
standing O
beside O
the O
ravine O
. O

My O
heart O
was O
throbbing O
when O
I O
walked O
through O
the O
village B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
afraid O
of O
every O
look O
. O

Where O
should O
I O
go O
? O
People O
will O
surely O
be O
afraid O
to O
let O
me O
in O
since O
you O
get O
the O
death B-TER
penalty O
for O
it O
. O

My O
closest O
friends O
were O
the O
family B-TER
of O
Kyril B-PER
Arsentyevitsh I-PER
Redko I-PER
. O

They O
hid B-TER
Jews O
risking O
their O
lives O
. O

They O
were O
denounced O
and O
almost O
got O
killed B-TER
. O

I O
knew O
about O
this O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
get O
them O
into O
trouble O
. O

So O
where O
should O
I O
go O
? O
It O
is O
almost O
nighttime O
. O

I O
wo O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

I O
found O
a O
public O
toilet O
which O
consisted O
of O
three O
cabins O
. O

There O
, O
I O
stayed O
for O
three O
days O
and O
four O
nights O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
describe O
the O
horror O
. O

It O
was O
terribly O
cold O
, O
the O
wind O
blew O
through O
every O
crack O
. O

I O
had O
frost O
bites O
all O
over O
. O

I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
bread B-TER
, O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
. O

Every O
minute O
somebody O
could O
have O
found O
me O
. O

On O
the O
fourth O
day O
, O
I O
started O
to O
freeze B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
. O

Suddenly O
, O
I O
felt O
warm O
. O

I O
heard O
how O
I O
said O
: O
Water O
! O
A O
bit O
of O
water O
! O
... O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
I O
made O
it O
through O
to O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Exceeding O
all O
strengths O
, O
I O
got O
up O
from O
the O
dirty O
floor O
and O
went O
out O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Kyril B-PER
Arsentyevitsh I-PER
. O

I O
kept O
falling O
down O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
they O
lived O
close O
to O
the O
location O
where O
I O
had O
taken O
refuge B-TER
. O

They O
received O
me O
warmly O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
three O
days O
. O

When O
I O
recovered O
a O
little O
, O
I O
felt O
again O
that O
I O
am O
a O
human O
being O
equal O
to O
all O
others O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
food B-TER
and O
with O
a O
broken O
heart O
said O
goodbye O
to O
me O
. O

My O
feet O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
on O
anymore O
. O

They O
felt O
like O
wooden O
blocks O
. O

I O
set O
out O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
a O
horrible O
thing O
to O
be O
on O
one O
’s O
way O
without O
knowing O
where O
to O
. O

Who O
will O
take O
me O
in O
? O
Who O
needs O
me O
? O
With O
difficulty O
, O
I O
made O
it O
to O
Korotysh B-LOC
. O

I O
entered O
several O
cottages O
, O
requested O
to O
stay O
for O
the O
night O
, O
but O
was O
turned O
down O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
find O
a O
place O
where O
nobody O
would O
notice O
me O
and O
to O
freeze B-TER
to I-TER
death I-TER
there O
. O

But O
before O
that O
I O
went O
into O
the O
last O
cottage O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
, O
they O
let O
me O
stay O
for O
the O
night O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
, O
there O
was O
a O
big O
snowstorm O
and O
the O
mistress O
of O
the O
house O
felt O
sorry O
for O
me O
and O
let O
me O
stay O
with O
them O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
three O
weeks O
. O

Germans B-TER
often O
came O
to O
the O
cottage O
. O

They O
were O
looking O
for O
partisans B-TER
, O
but O
they O
miraculously O
did O
not O
find O
me O
. O

Eventually O
, O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
them O
as O
well O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
walk O
, O
however O
. O

My O
feet O
had O
turned O
into O
a O
black O
, O
purulent O
mass O
. O

Before O
I O
departed O
, O
the O
homeowner O
’s O
mother B-TER
- I-TER
in I-TER
- I-TER
law I-TER
said O
to O
me O
: O
Wait O
. O

She O
escorted O
me O
to O
the O
doctor B-TER
in O
the O
cottage O
laboratory O
. O

He O
examined O
me O
and O
said O
: O
Your O
feet O
are O
lost O
. O

This O
felt O
like O
a O
second O
death B-TER
sentence O
. O

What O
shall O
I O
do O
in O
my O
situation O
without O
feet O
? O
I O
want O
to O
relate O
something O
about O
the O
doctor B-TER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
his O
family B-TER
name O
but O
he O
was O
called O
Petro O
. O

He O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
and O
used O
to O
come O
to O
renew O
my O
compresses O
. O

This O
was O
a O
wonderful O
Soviet B-TER
person O
. O

He O
suspected O
who O
I O
was O
. O

When O
the O
nurse B-TER
whispered O
something O
to O
him O
while O
writing O
down O
my O
family B-TER
name O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
This O
is O
not O
relevant O
to O
us O
. O

Our O
responsibility O
is O
to O
help O
this O
woman O
. O

And O
so O
I O
lay O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
in O
Lyubotyn B-LOC
. O

For O
me O
, O
it O
was O
paradise O
. O

I O
lay O
on O
a O
soft O
bed O
, O
nobody O
chased O
me O
away O
. O

I O
was O
given O
food B-TER
twice O
a O
day O
. O

And O
even O
if O
this O
was O
not O
much O
, O
it O
was O
at O
least O
a O
warm O
meal O
. O

I O
remained O
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
like O
this O
for O
six O
months O
– O
from O
February O
7 O
, O
1942 O
, O
to O
July O
2 O
, O
1942 O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
: O
when O
I O
was O
hospitalized B-TER
, O
they O
did O
not O
look O
at O
my O
passport B-TER
. O

And O
I O
did O
not O
let O
go O
of O
the O
passport B-TER
the O
whole O
time O
. O

I O
hid B-TER
it O
in O
between O
the O
mattresses O
. O

I O
feel O
terrible O
when O
I O
think O
about O
how O
they O
amputated O
the O
toes O
of O
both O
my O
feet O
and O
after O
that O
cut O
off O
the O
inner O
bones O
. O

After O
a O
month O
, O
I O
got O
a O
fever O
– O
40 O
degree O
. O

I O
could O
only O
lay O
on O
my O
back O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
sleep O
because O
of O
the O
pain O
. O

I O
only O
wanted O
one O
thing O
– O
to O
die B-TER
in O
the O
hospital B-TER
. O

When O
the O
hospital B-TER
releases O
me O
– O
where O
will O
I O
go O
? O
I O
envied O
every O
dying O
person O
. O

Then O
I O
understood O
how O
lucky O
people O
are O
who O
die B-TER
a O
natural O
death B-TER
. O

When O
sick B-TER
people O
were O
brought O
in O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
, O
I O
usually O
hid B-TER
my O
face O
under O
the O
blanket O
and O
looked O
out O
with O
just O
one O
eye O
– O
what O
if O
I O
see O
a O
familiar O
face O
? O
The O
staff B-TER
treated O
me O
really O
well O
, O
helped O
me O
in O
any O
way O
they O
could O
. O

The O
surgeon B-TER
also O
gave O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
. O

In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
in O
this O
hospital B-TER
that O
I O
found O
my O
salvation O
. O

Once O
, O
a O
sick B-TER
woman B-TER
was O
brought O
in O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
severely O
ill B-TER
and O
soon O
died B-TER
. O

She O
was O
38 O
years O
old O
. O

I O
had O
just O
one O
thought O
on O
my O
mind O
– O
her O
passport B-TER
could O
save O
my O
life O
. O

And O
I O
got O
a O
hold O
of O
this O
very O
passport B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
released O
from O
the O
hospital B-TER
, O
I O
stayed O
with O
a O
hospital B-TER
nurse B-TER
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

After O
that O
time O
, O
I O
went O
on O
my O
way O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
try O
and O
find O
my O
sister B-TER
. O

I O
guessed O
where O
she O
might O
have O
gone O
to O
. O

The O
way O
to O
get O
there O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
one O
, O
though O
. O

The O
wounds O
on O
my O
feet O
had O
not O
healed O
yet O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
by O
foot O
, O
hungry B-TER
on O
top O
of O
it O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
Mertshik B-LOC
, O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
could O
not O
go O
on O
– O
I O
was O
too O
weak O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
get O
on O
a O
train B-TER
, O
but O
a O
German B-TER
asked O
me O
whether O
I O
have O
a O
passage O
permit O
. O

He O
threw O
me O
out O
of O
the O
wagon O
. O

A O
policeman B-TER
advised O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
commander O
to O
get O
the O
passage O
permit O
. O

The O
commander O
, O
however O
, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
wild O
animal O
, O
not O
a O
human O
being O
. O

He O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
me O
to O
the O
end O
and O
started O
screaming O
: O
To O
hell O
! O
Get O
out O
. O

I O
sat O
at O
the O
train B-TER
station O
until O
the O
evening O
. O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
the O
building O
where O
train B-TER
workers O
lived O
. O

I O
met O
a O
kind O
- O
hearted O
woman B-TER
there O
. O

She O
fed O
me O
and O
let O
me O
stay O
over O
night O
. O

She O
also O
helped O
me O
obtain O
a O
passage O
permit O
. O

I O
could O
not O
imagine O
the O
happiness O
I O
would O
feel O
– O
is O
it O
possible O
that O
I O
will O
see O
my O
only O
, O
my O
dearest O
sister B-TER
soon O
? O
Maybe O
these O
animals O
killed B-TER
her O
? O
The O
train B-TER
departed O
from O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

I O
hid B-TER
in O
a O
corner O
so O
that O
nobody O
catches O
sight O
of O
me O
. O

At O
2 O
pm O
, O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
shtetl O
Smorodyne B-LOC
. O

I O
crossed O
the O
street O
and O
suddenly O
I O
understood O
that O
I O
wo O
n’t O
be O
able O
to O
find O
my O
sister B-TER
– O
after O
all O
, O
I O
can O
not O
inquire O
about O
her O
since O
this O
will O
arouse O
suspicion O
. O

Some O
woman B-TER
noticed O
how O
lost O
I O
was O
. O

She O
asked O
: O
What O
is O
with O
you O
? O
I O
replied O
that O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
hungry B-TER
. O

She O
took O
me O
to O
her O
home O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
food B-TER
, O
bread B-TER
. O

I O
threw O
myself O
on O
it O
. O

I O
was O
blushing O
out O
of O
shame O
. O

I O
said O
: O
Pardon O
me O
. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
finish O
one O
meal O
, O
not O
more O
. O

I O
stayed O
with O
them O
for O
one O
and O
a O
half O
months O
, O
cooked O
for O
them O
, O
cleaned O
the O
house O
. O

This O
woman B-TER
played O
a O
big O
role O
in O
my O
life O
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
she O
is O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
my O
sister B-TER
. O

How O
should O
I O
convey O
to O
you O
our O
reunion O
? O
I O
wanted O
to O
throw O
myself O
at O
my O
sister B-TER
, O
to O
embrace O
her O
, O
to O
kiss O
her O
– O
I O
was O
convinced O
after O
all O
that O
she O
had O
died B-TER
, O
and O
she O
– O
that O
I O
was O
long O
gone O
. O

Yet O
, O
our O
conversation O
was O
cold O
. O

We O
pretended O
that O
we O
do O
n’t O
really O
know O
each O
other O
. O

We O
had O
to O
have O
iron O
patience O
to O
persevere O
. O

I O
stayed O
in O
Smorodyne B-LOC
for O
one O
year O
and O
three O
months O
. O

I O
was O
as O
a O
chef O
, O
a O
nanny O
, O
a O
beggar O
and O
lingered O
in O
different O
corners O
of O
the O
city B-LOC
. O

I O
saw O
how O
the O
German B-TER
barbarians O
took O
revenge O
on O
the O
youth O
. O

Immediately O
after O
examining O
them O
, O
they O
confined O
them O
in O
a O
special O
building B-LOC
and O
they O
would O
n’t O
even O
allow O
them O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
their O
families B-TER
. O

Relatives O
used O
to O
run O
after O
them O
, O
and O
the O
bandits O
used O
to O
shoot B-TER
at O
them O
in O
turn O
. O

There O
were O
many O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
teenagers B-TER
maimed O
themselves O
or O
committed B-TER
suicide I-TER
everything O
so O
that O
they O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Germany B-TER
. O

It O
was O
usually O
a O
horrific O
scene O
when O
trains B-TER
departed O
. O

The O
train B-TER
station O
trembled O
from O
the O
cries O
. O

The O
unfortunate O
children B-TER
screamed O
: O
Where O
do O
you O
take O
us O
to O
, O
murderers O
? O
The O
relatives O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
approach O
the O
train B-TER
. O

The O
front O
came O
closer O
. O

For O
two O
weeks O
, O
we O
stayed O
in O
the O
basement O
. O

Two O
written O
orders O
were O
sent O
to O
our O
house O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
our O
army B-TER
entered O
Smorodyne B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
so O
happy O
! O
Ours O
! O
So O
I O
returned O
home O
– O
to O
Kharkiv B-LOC
. O

I O
can O
walk O
around O
freely O
and O
look O
everyone O
in O
the O
eyes O
… O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
after O
all O
of O
the O
things O
I O
have O
experienced O
, O
I O
love O
our O
homeland O
even O
stronger O
. O

This O
is O
a O
country O
in O
which O
every O
human O
being O
has O
the O
right O
to O
live O
. O
