Sir O
, O
re O
the O
Interned O
Jews O
on O
board O
the O
Tug O
Laortis O
, O
near O
Rajka B-LOC
. O

We O
very O
much O
regret O
to O
hear O
the O
negative O
result O
of O
the O
Conference O
, O
as O
reported O
to O
our O
President O
, O
Mrs. O
Marie B-PER
Schmolka I-PER
, O
who O
has O
just O
returned O
from O
London B-LOC
. O

Mrs. O
Schmolka B-PER
went O
to O
Paris B-LOC
and O
the O
whole O
matter O
was O
again O
reviewed O
by O
Hicem B-ORG
, O
who O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
no O
other O
way O
to O
solve O
this O
question O
except O
by O
the O
plan O
proposed O
. O

The O
families B-TER
with O
many O
children B-TER
can O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
Argentine B-LOC
as O
First O
Class O
Tourists O
as O
the O
expense O
would O
be O
ar O
too O
great O
, O
for O
each O
person O
11,500 O
Crowns O
, O
a O
family B-TER
of O
six O
persons O
costing O
about O
Five O
hundred O
pounds O
sterling O
. O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
people B-TER
on O
board O
the O
tug O
is O
worse O
than O
anyone O
can O
imagine O
, O
as O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
the O
enclosed O
copy O
of O
letter O
received O
by O
us O
and O
also O
from O
what O
Mrs. O
Schmolka B-PER
saw O
when O
she O
visited O
them O
on O
board O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
under O
the O
cirumstances O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
can O
not O
accept O
sole O
responsibility O
for O
these O
poor O
people B-TER
but O
must O
pass O
some O
on O
to O
the O
shoulders O
of O
Jewry O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

Hoping O
to O
hear O
from O
you O
in O
the O
very O
near O
future O
that O
you O
have O
used O
your O
influence O
to O
favourably O
reconsider O
this O
matter O
. O

We O
remain O
, O
Yours O
truly O
. O
