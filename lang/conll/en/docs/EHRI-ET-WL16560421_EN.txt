Imprisoned B-TER
again O
On O
8 O
May O
1945 O
we O
were O
theoretically O
liberated B-TER
by O
the O
Russian B-ORG
army B-TER
. O

The O
fortress B-LOC
i.e. O
Theresienstadt O
was O
immediately O
put O
under O
quarantine O
because O
the O
camp B-TER
was O
infected O
with O
typhus B-TER
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
ignored O
the O
order O
not O
to O
leave O
the O
fortress B-LOC
and O
they O
and O
many O
others O
with O
them O
made O
trips O
to O
the O
area O
around O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
from O
where O
they O
returned O
with O
lots O
of O
cherries B-TER
. O

We O
had O
not O
seen O
any O
fruit B-TER
for O
ages O
and O
when O
some O
of O
the O
prisoners B-TER
brought O
cherries B-TER
back O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
without O
being O
stopped O
I O
too O
had O
the O
idea O
of O
picking O
cherries B-TER
in O
the O
gardens O
nearby O
. O

I O
was O
to O
pay O
dearly O
for O
this O
! O
On O
5 O
June O
1945 O
I O
followed O
the O
path O
leading O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
, O
along O
which O
were O
the O
orchards O
. O

On O
my O
way O
I O
came O
across O
a O
Soviet B-LOC
soldier B-TER
who O
thought O
I O
was O
a O
German B-LOC
officer B-TER
who O
had O
put O
on O
civilian B-TER
clothes B-TER
in O
order O
to O
escape B-TER
imprisonment B-TER
. O

The O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
soldier B-TER
did O
not O
, O
or O
did O
not O
want O
to O
, O
understand O
German B-LOC
, O
and O
arrested B-TER
me O
. O

I O
laughed O
, O
because O
I O
was O
convinced O
I O
would O
be O
free B-TER
again O
within O
the O
hour O
, O
but O
I O
was O
terribly O
wrong O
. O

I O
was O
soon O
to O
stop O
laughing O
, O
for O
Ing O
[= O
Ingenieur O
] O
Vogel B-PER
from O
Prague B-LOC
, O
who O
has O
been O
appointed O
by O
the O
Soviets B-LOC
as O
mayor O
of O
the O
liberated B-TER
town O
of O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
did O
nothing O
to O
get O
me O
released B-TER
, O
although O
as O
a O
Czech B-LOC
and O
a O
former O
member O
of O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
it O
was O
he O
who O
knew O
best O
what O
I O
had O
done O
for O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
helping O
me O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
take O
it O
out O
on O
the O
capitalist O
, O
who O
himself O
had O
become O
impoverished O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
accusations O
he O
brought O
against O
me O
, O
nor O
have O
I O
ever O
found O
out O
what O
his O
arguments O
were O
. O

However O
, O
I O
learnt O
after O
my O
liberation B-TER
that O
when O
questioning O
the O
former O
camp B-TER
commandant B-TER
, O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
, O
in O
Vienna B-LOC
, O
Ing O
Vogel B-PER
asked O
him O
directly O
during O
the O
trial B-TER
whether O
I O
had O
violated O
Jewish O
interests O
. O

With O
the O
rope O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
stated O
clearly O
and O
definitely O
that O
I O
had O
always O
represented O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
had O
never O
acted O
against O
those O
interests O
. O

It O
would O
then O
damn O
well O
have O
been O
Vogel B-PER
’s I-PER
duty O
and O
obligation O
, O
in O
Prague B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
, O
to O
inform O
the O
authorities B-TER
of O
this O
statement O
by O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
. O

Only O
a O
small O
group O
know O
of O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
’s I-PER
answer O
. O

Vogel B-PER
has O
succeeded O
in O
withholding O
Dr O
Seidl B-PER
’s I-PER
statement O
, O
which O
had O
been O
provoked O
by O
him O
and O
which O
was O
very O
favourable O
to O
me O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
I O
have O
had O
political B-TER
discussions O
with O
Vogel B-PER
which O
showed O
that O
I O
was O
his O
political B-TER
opponent O
, O
but O
I O
had O
always O
supported O
Vogel B-PER
as O
the O
head O
of O
a O
technical B-LOC
department I-LOC
. O

He O
even O
greeted O
me O
after O
the O
liberation B-TER
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Pancrace O
prison B-TER
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
not O
to O
be O
questioned O
as O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
told O
me O
, O
but O
to O
keep O
me O
out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
. O

First O
, O
I O
had O
to O
strip O
to O
be O
searched O
for O
contraband B-TER
– O
exactly O
the O
same O
procedure O
as O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Except O
for O
the O
uniform B-TER
and O
the O
language O
, O
nothing O
had O
changed O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
second O
floor O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
cell B-TER
149 O
of O
section O
IIB O
. O

This O
cell B-TER
was O
already O
occupied O
by O
nine O
men B-TER
; O
when O
the O
door O
was O
opened O
there O
was O
such O
a O
nauseating O
stench O
that O
I O
could O
not O
help O
vomiting O
– O
the O
cell B-TER
in O
question O
was O
in O
fact O
designed O
for O
a O
single O
prisoner B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
lie O
on O
the O
floor O
like O
sardines O
; O
when O
one O
of O
us O
wanted O
to O
turn O
over O
– O
you O
could O
not O
lie O
on O
the O
same O
side O
all O
the O
time O
after O
all O
– O
he O
had O
to O
signal O
so O
that O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
could O
turn O
over O
. O

My O
cell B-TER
companions O
had O
been O
imprisoned B-TER
since O
early O
May O
, O
and O
despite O
the O
short O
time O
there O
were O
completely O
starving B-TER
. O

I O
had O
some O
bread B-TER
with O
me O
, O
which O
they O
at O
once O
greedily O
devoured O
. O

The O
next O
day O
I O
was O
led O
to O
the O
office O
. O

There O
I O
had O
to O
provide O
my O
signature O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
I O
signed O
, O
since O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
any O
Czech B-LOC
at O
all O
. O

I O
had O
some O
Russian B-LOC
silver O
coins B-TER
with O
me O
which O
I O
had O
kept O
as O
a O
souvenir O
from O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
and O
also O
450 O
Czech B-LOC
crowns B-TER
. O

All O
this O
was O
confiscated B-TER
, O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
it O
again O
. O

This O
procedure O
being O
completed O
, O
I O
was O
led O
back O
, O
not O
to O
the O
same O
cell B-TER
, O
however O
, O
but O
to O
the O
door O
of O
cell B-TER
197 O
, O
section O
IIIB O
. O

The O
Roman O
numerals O
indicate O
the O
floor O
where O
the O
cell B-TER
is O
. O

Thus O
IIIB O
was O
on O
the O
third O
floor O
. O

Although O
I O
had O
not O
left O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
I O
had O
to O
strip O
to O
be O
searched O
again O
. O

Only O
then O
was O
I O
allowed O
to O
enter O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

To O
top O
it O
all O
, O
I O
had O
to O
stand O
there O
with O
my O
face O
turned O
to O
the O
wall O
– O
just O
like O
with O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

In O
cell B-TER
197 O
there O
were O
only O
seven O
prisoners B-TER
, O
six O
Czechs B-LOC
and O
one O
German B-LOC
from O
the O
Sudetenland B-LOC
. O

Although O
I O
spent O
only O
one O
night O
with O
these O
Czechs B-LOC
I O
got O
a O
very O
good O
impression O
of O
them O
. O

Later O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
my O
first O
impression O
was O
correct O
. O

One O
of O
them O
escaped B-TER
later O
. O

He O
had O
been O
the O
leader O
of O
a O
youth B-TER
organisation I-TER
. O

That O
was O
one O
reason O
why O
he O
was O
mistreated B-TER
in O
an O
especially O
cruel O
way O
. O

They O
put O
a O
water O
hose O
into O
his O
mouth O
, O
turned O
the O
water O
on O
, O
and O
allowed O
the O
full O
water O
pressure O
into O
his O
body O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
, O
the O
torture B-TER
this O
man B-TER
had O
to O
suffer O
. O

I O
just O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
Czech B-LOC
people B-TER
could O
carry O
out O
such O
brutal O
actions O
. O

They O
had O
learnt O
well O
, O
too O
well O
, O
from O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

I O
saw O
atrocities O
like O
those O
I O
have O
experienced O
only O
at O
the O
worst O
times O
. O

On O
Monday O
16 O
July O
1945 O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
were O
separated O
from O
the O
Germans B-LOC
because O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
were O
given O
more O
and O
better O
food B-TER
. O

As O
I O
did O
n’t O
understand O
any O
Czech B-LOC
and O
only O
spoke O
German B-LOC
I O
was O
assigned O
to O
the O
Germans B-LOC
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
I O
who O
had O
been O
persecuted B-TER
for O
many O
years O
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
the O
SS B-ORG
was O
now O
lumped O
in O
with O
my O
enemies O
. O

The O
small O
food B-TER
ration I-TER
was O
particularly O
hard O
for O
me O
because O
I O
had O
been O
underfed O
for O
years O
and O
had O
hardly O
recovered O
. O

The O
food B-TER
was O
totally O
insufficient O
. O

Dinner B-TER
consisted O
of O
0.2 O
litres O
of O
soup B-TER
, O
sometimes O
with O
a O
small O
potato B-TER
in O
it O
. O

If O
there O
was O
gravy B-TER
and O
potatoes B-TER
you O
might O
perhaps O
be O
lucky O
enough O
to O
get O
one O
and O
half O
potatoes B-TER
and O
0.1 O
litre O
of O
gravy B-TER
. O

Every O
day O
we O
got O
145 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
an O
additional O
72.5 O
g O
in O
the O
evening O
three O
times O
a O
week O
. O

Many O
ate O
their O
bread B-TER
immediately O
, O
others O
watched O
it O
carefully O
in O
order O
to O
ration B-TER
it O
; O
I O
belonged O
to O
the O
latter O
group O
, O
because O
of O
my O
own O
experience O
. O

But O
whatever O
you O
did O
, O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
and O
you O
did O
not O
get O
any O
more O
. O

People B-TER
died B-TER
of O
exhaustion O
, O
precipitated O
by O
frequent O
bouts O
of O
diarrhoea B-TER
which O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
. O

I O
had O
starved B-TER
in O
Minsk B-LOC
, O
but O
had O
not O
felt O
the O
hunger B-TER
so O
much O
there O
as O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
perhaps O
because O
of O
the O
additional O
mental B-TER
suffering O
. O

We O
were O
so O
dreadfully O
hungry B-TER
that O
we O
tore O
grass O
from O
the O
meagre O
lawn O
during O
our O
turns O
in O
the O
courtyard O
in O
order O
to O
eat B-TER
it O
. O

Anyone O
caught O
red O
- O
handed O
was O
flogged O
. O

That O
is O
why O
there O
was O
a O
big O
but O
: O
how O
could O
we O
get O
this O
grass O
without O
being O
noticed O
by O
the O
overseer O
? O
That O
was O
not O
easy O
because O
the O
guards B-TER
watched O
us O
very O
closely O
. O

One O
of O
our O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
would O
stop O
and O
bend O
down O
in O
order O
to O
re O
- O
tie O
loose O
shoe B-TER
laces O
. O

Thus O
he O
drew O
the O
guard B-TER
’s I-TER
attention O
to O
himself O
and O
one O
of O
the O
others O
could O
pull O
up O
some O
grass O
which O
was O
shared O
out O
and O
eaten B-TER
in O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
one O
of O
the O
head O
warders B-TER
lived O
on O
eggs B-TER
– O
allegedly O
for O
health B-TER
reasons O
. O

Convinced O
, O
though O
wrongly O
, O
that O
by O
eating O
egg B-TER
shells O
we O
would O
provide O
our O
bodies O
with O
calcium O
, O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
give O
us O
the O
shells O
, O
which O
he O
did O
very O
readily O
. O

We O
then O
ground O
the O
shells O
to O
powder O
and O
ate B-TER
them O
, O
until O
a O
doctor B-TER
was O
transferred O
to O
our O
cell B-TER
. O

He O
told O
us O
that O
the O
egg B-TER
shell O
had O
no O
nutritional B-TER
value O
at O
all O
, O
and O
left O
the O
body O
unchanged O
. O

We O
had O
lost O
an O
illusion O
! O
To O
fill O
our O
stomachs O
more O
effectively O
we O
soaked O
the O
bread B-TER
in O
water B-TER
until O
it O
was O
like O
mush B-TER
. O

Thus O
the O
volume O
of O
our O
food B-TER
was O
greater O
and O
we O
felt O
full O
, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
not O
more O
nutritious B-TER
. O

We O
only O
had O
one O
thought O
: O
what O
can O
we O
do O
about O
the O
hunger B-TER
? O
Some O
smoked O
the O
potato B-TER
peelings O
to O
try O
to O
think O
of O
something O
else O
. O

Although O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
and O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
were O
my O
enemies O
, O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
watch O
them O
being O
even O
more O
maltreated O
… O
and O
they O
really O
were O
dreadfully O
maltreated O
! O
In O
our O
cell B-TER
there O
was O
a O
Gestapoman O
who O
was O
targeted O
from O
time O
to O
time O
by O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

It O
was O
particularly O
horrible O
because O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
watch O
. O

Usually O
these O
atrocities O
took O
place O
on O
Sundays O
, O
because O
there O
was O
less O
supervision O
. O

On O
the O
floor O
below O
us O
there O
were O
Hitler B-ORG
youth I-ORG
, O
they O
were O
called O
Werewolves O
, O
a O
name O
I O
had O
not O
come O
across O
before O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
hear O
them O
howling O
with O
pain O
. O

One O
day O
a O
cell B-TER
mate O
called O
Gallee B-PER
was O
fetched O
for O
an O
interrogation O
. O

When O
he O
came O
back O
we O
hardly O
recognised O
him O
. O

His O
face O
was O
puffy B-TER
, O
his O
hands O
extremely O
swollen B-TER
, O
he O
was O
carrying O
his O
shoes B-TER
because O
they O
no O
longer O
fitted O
. O

The O
interrogator B-TER
wanted O
to O
make O
him O
confess O
that O
he O
was O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
which O
Gallee B-PER
kept O
insisting O
he O
was O
not O
, O
despite O
the O
torture B-TER
. O

For O
quite O
some O
time O
Gallee B-PER
was O
unable O
to O
walk O
or O
eat B-TER
. O

As O
we O
learnt O
later O
, O
he O
had O
been O
mistaken O
for O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
man B-TER
of O
a O
similar O
name O
. O

On O
25 O
July O
1945 O
there O
was O
a O
sudden O
and O
unexpected O
order B-TER
: O
To O
work O
! O
The O
guard B-TER
selected B-TER
those O
men B-TER
who O
were O
strong O
enough O
to O
work B-TER
; O
Gallee B-PER
and O
I O
were O
not O
amongst O
them O
. O

When O
the O
workers B-TER
returned O
from O
work B-TER
in O
the O
evening O
they O
were O
thrilled O
, O
because O
they O
had O
been O
received O
so O
well O
by O
the O
population B-TER
. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
people B-TER
had O
not O
known O
that O
these O
were O
Germans B-LOC
. O

From O
all O
sides O
they O
had O
been O
slipped O
bread B-TER
and O
an O
occasional O
piece O
of O
sausage B-TER
. O

The O
bread B-TER
which O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
eat B-TER
they O
brought O
back O
to O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
gave O
into O
temptation O
to O
eat B-TER
my O
fill O
, O
which O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
me O
– O
it O
turned O
my O
stomach O
. O

The O
following O
evening O
the O
workers B-TER
had O
to O
line O
up O
outside O
the O
cell B-TER
door O
. O

All O
the O
bread B-TER
they O
had O
was O
taken O
away O
. O

The O
work B-TER
they O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
clear O
the O
narrow O
courtyards O
of O
the O
rubbish O
that O
had O
accumulated O
over O
the O
years O
. O

As O
I O
saw O
later O
, O
the O
rubbish O
was O
metres O
high O
in O
the O
narrow O
Prague B-LOC
courtyards O
, O
giving O
rise O
to O
air O
pollution O
. O

Since O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
painted O
a O
glowing O
picture O
of O
their O
work B-TER
I O
was O
also O
tempted O
to O
apply O
for O
work B-TER
, O
to O
make O
life O
more O
tolerable O
. O

My O
guard B-TER
wanted O
to O
help O
me O
, O
and O
put O
me O
into O
a O
group O
which O
worked B-TER
for O
the O
Russians B-LOC
. O

He O
thought O
we O
would O
be O
well O
fed B-TER
there O
; O
but O
although O
we O
had O
to O
work B-TER
very O
hard O
, O
we O
did O
not O
get O
anything O
at O
all O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

The O
next O
day O
the O
Russian B-LOC
soldier B-TER
wanted O
to O
fetch O
us O
again O
, O
but O
nobody O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

The O
Russian B-LOC
promised O
us O
a O
hot O
meal B-TER
and O
plenty O
of O
bread B-TER
… O
and O
compensation B-TER
for O
the O
previous O
day O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
even O
harder O
, O
we O
were O
harried O
like O
slaves O
. O

We O
were O
given O
not O
food B-TER
but O
whippings O
. O

Some O
days O
later O
I O
went O
into O
the O
town O
with O
a O
work B-TER
detail O
. O

We O
were O
employed O
to O
sweep O
the O
streets O
and O
also O
to O
clear O
the O
heaps O
of O
rubble O
. O

These O
were O
so O
firmly O
compacted O
that O
we O
had O
to O
use O
hoes O
to O
loosen O
them O
. O

To O
make O
up O
for O
this O
we O
received O
250 O
g O
of O
bread B-TER
and O
50 O
g O
of O
sausage B-TER
. O

After O
starving B-TER
for O
so O
long O
this O
was O
a O
real O
relief O
. O

But O
we O
only O
got O
this O
ration B-TER
once O
, O
it O
became O
smaller O
every O
day O
– O
whether O
this O
was O
above O
board O
or O
through O
racketeering O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O

My O
body O
, O
however O
, O
was O
telling O
me O
that O
I O
was O
using O
up O
more O
calories O
than O
I O
was O
consuming O
, O
so O
that O
I O
had O
to O
give O
up O
working B-TER
: O
after O
all O
, O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
completely O
to O
the O
dogs O
. O

What O
made O
the O
work B-TER
worse O
was O
that O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
workmen B-TER
themselves O
who O
beat O
us O
with O
their O
rifle O
butts O
. O

Even O
though O
they O
were O
road O
sweepers O
themselves O
they O
did O
not O
have O
a O
clue O
how O
to O
work B-TER
efficiently O
. O

They O
forced O
us O
eight O
at O
a O
time O
to O
load O
a O
lorry O
from O
one O
side O
. O

Consequently O
we O
stood O
in O
each O
other O
’s O
way O
, O
and O
could O
not O
help O
throwing O
the O
dirt O
at O
each O
other O
. O

If O
they O
had O
employed O
four O
men B-TER
at O
a O
time O
, O
letting O
us O
work B-TER
in O
turns O
, O
we O
could O
easily O
have O
done O
much O
more O
. O

But O
this O
would O
have O
required O
brains O
, O
which O
they O
did O
not O
have O
. O

After O
a O
longer O
interval O
some O
workers B-TER
were O
withdrawn O
from O
a O
work B-TER
detail O
, O
the O
best O
one O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
were O
put O
into O
a O
transport B-TER
. O

A O
cell B-TER
mate O
who O
worked B-TER
in O
this O
group O
took O
me O
with O
him O
and O
now O
a O
golden O
period O
began O
for O
me O
, O
which O
was O
to O
last O
from O
10 O
October O
until O
just O
before O
Christmas B-TER
. O

There O
was O
plenty O
of O
very O
good O
food B-TER
, O
there O
was O
so O
much O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
some O
food B-TER
back O
to O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
who O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
to O
work B-TER
. O

This O
was O
to O
be O
my O
undoing O
later O
. O

In O
July O
and O
also O
in O
August O
somebody O
had O
delivered O
a O
parcel O
with O
linen O
and O
food B-TER
for O
me O
. O

The O
food B-TER
was O
withheld O
from O
me O
, O
a O
KZ B-TER
Konzentrationslager O
– O
concentration O
camp O
prisoner B-TER
! O
– O
it O
was O
confiscated B-TER
because O
at O
that O
time O
Germans B-LOC
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
receive O
food B-TER
. O

Finally O
I O
received O
one O
parcel O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
guard B-TER
; O
the O
trusty O
had O
stolen O
only O
the O
butter B-TER
. O

In O
this O
parcel O
there O
were O
two O
pieces O
of O
soap B-TER
and O
125 O
g O
of O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
. O

As O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
almost O
daily O
and O
the O
bread B-TER
we O
had O
saved O
was O
confiscated B-TER
each O
time O
, O
I O
preferred O
to O
take O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
and O
soap B-TER
with O
me O
when O
I O
went O
to O
work B-TER
. O

The O
reader O
will O
be O
surprised O
and O
ask O
, O
So O
, O
there O
was O
some O
saved O
bread O
was O
there O
? O
On O
Saturdays O
we O
only O
worked B-TER
until O
noon O
, O
and O
often O
not O
at O
all O
. O

That O
’s O
why O
we O
saved O
some O
bread B-TER
, O
so O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
make O
do O
with O
the O
scarce O
food B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
on O
Saturdays O
and O
Sundays O
. O

On O
10 O
December O
1945 O
I O
met O
my O
misfortune O
in O
the O
person O
of O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
Waliczek B-PER
. O

I O
had O
brought O
my O
billycan O
full O
of O
food B-TER
for O
my O
cell B-TER
mates B-TER
. O

This O
was O
immediately O
confiscated B-TER
for O
Waliczek B-PER
’s I-PER
watchdogs O
, O
followed O
by O
my O
towel O
, O
soap B-TER
and O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
. O

He O
argued O
that O
I O
had O
stolen O
these O
things O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
that O
he O
did O
not O
become O
violent O
, O
particularly O
as O
he O
was O
drunk O
. O

Usually O
he O
beat O
people B-TER
up O
mercilessly O
. O

When O
I O
wanted O
to O
complain O
about O
him O
the O
guard B-TER
said O
, O
Do O
n’t O
do O
it O
, O
you O
’ll O
be O
left O
to O
carry O
the O
can O
! O
I O
had O
saved O
the O
bacon B-TER
fat I-TER
because O
I O
knew O
that O
we O
would O
not O
be O
working B-TER
from O
before O
Christmas B-TER
until O
4 O
January O
because O
of O
lack O
of O
coal O
, O
and O
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
have O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
during O
that O
time O
. O

But O
I O
had O
not O
reckoned O
with O
warder B-TER
Waliczek B-PER
, O
whom O
the O
prisoners B-TER
who O
had O
been O
guards B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
during O
the O
German B-LOC
times O
described O
as O
someone O
who O
had O
always O
boasted O
that O
he O
was O
German B-LOC
. O

They O
thought O
that O
now O
he O
wanted O
to O
prove O
that O
he O
was O
a O
good O
Czech B-LOC
. O

One O
evening O
when O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
already O
locked O
for O
the O
night O
our O
cell B-TER
door O
suddenly O
opened O
. O

Waliczek B-PER
appeared O
with O
several O
officials O
; O
he O
said O
to O
Knurrhahn B-PER
, O
a O
prisoner B-TER
and O
former O
guard B-TER
, O
Please O
come O
outside O
! O
No O
sooner O
had O
the O
door O
closed O
again O
than O
we O
heard O
a O
heavy O
fall O
, O
followed O
by O
loud O
groans O
. O

Knurrhahn B-PER
had O
been O
thrown O
to O
the O
floor O
by O
all O
the O
officials O
, O
then O
picked O
up O
, O
thrown O
down O
, O
and O
finally O
flung O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

On O
another O
occasion O
a O
new O
prisoner B-TER
was O
thrown O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
, O
who O
was O
bleeding B-TER
like O
a O
stuck O
pig O
. O

His O
name O
was O
Walter B-PER
, O
he O
had O
become O
a O
German B-LOC
and O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
did O
not O
forgive O
him O
for O
that O
Translator O
’s O
note O
: O
this O
was O
of O
course O
during O
the O
German O
occupation O
of O
the O
Czechoslovakian O
Republic O
. O

I O
often O
thought O
I O
was O
in O
a O
madhouse O
. O

I O
could O
continue O
talking O
for O
a O
long O
time O
about O
these O
incidents O
; O
but O
I O
think O
that O
will O
do O
to O
give O
the O
reader O
an O
idea O
of O
what O
human O
irrationality O
can O
lead O
to O
. O

Instead O
of O
turning O
away O
from O
the O
atrocities O
committed O
by O
the O
Germans B-LOC
, O
these O
were O
used O
as O
pretexts O
and O
excuses O
to O
commit O
new O
crimes O
, O
even O
murders B-TER
, O
in O
prisons B-TER
. O

I O
am O
convinced O
that O
none O
of O
these O
atrocities O
could O
have O
happened O
if O
there O
had O
been O
strict O
supervision O
. O

The O
director O
was O
nowhere O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
the O
head O
warders B-TER
were O
either O
too O
lazy O
or O
too O
cowardly O
or O
they O
even O
took O
part O
in O
these O
crimes O
. O

They O
let O
the O
younger O
guards B-TER
do O
as O
they O
wished O
. O

From O
4 O
January O
1946 O
until O
6 O
February O
I O
was O
again O
with O
my O
work B-TER
detail O
. O

I O
was O
glad O
that O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
or O
see O
anything O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
receiving O
good O
food B-TER
again O
. O

Unfortunately O
these O
good O
times O
were O
to O
end O
on O
6 O
February O
. O

On O
that O
day O
a O
five O
- O
ton O
lorry O
came O
especially O
to O
take O
me O
from O
my O
work B-TER
back O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
. O

In O
the O
police B-TER
guardroom O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
I O
was O
informed O
that O
my O
sons O
were O
fine O
… O
and O
then O
I O
was O
forbidden O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
the O
official O
was O
afraid O
I O
might O
escape B-TER
. O

If O
I O
had O
wanted O
to O
do O
that O
I O
could O
have O
fled B-TER
any O
day O
, O
as O
many O
others O
did O
. O

I O
was O
not O
interested O
in O
escaping B-TER
because O
that O
would O
have O
proved O
that O
I O
had O
a O
guilty O
conscience O
. O

But O
if O
I O
had O
known O
what O
lay O
ahead O
of O
me O
, O
that O
I O
would O
have O
to O
spend O
another O
whole O
year O
in O
Czech B-LOC
prisons B-TER
and O
that O
I O
would O
almost O
die B-TER
, O
I O
would O
have O
fled B-TER
then O
. O

On O
15 O
February O
I O
was O
suddenly O
fetched O
and O
handed O
over O
to O
a O
superintendent O
of O
the O
police B-TER
headquarters O
. O

He O
took O
me O
to O
his O
office O
, O
and O
this O
was O
my O
first O
and O
only O
examination O
. O

When O
it O
was O
over O
the O
official O
explained O
to O
me O
, O
On O
Monday O
or O
Tuesday O
we O
are O
having O
a O
conference O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
present O
your O
personal O
case O
and O
you O
will O
be O
released O
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

You O
can O
count O
on O
compensation O
for O
wrongful O
imprisonment O
. O

Then O
he O
led O
me O
to O
the O
officers O
’ O
mess O
, O
ordered O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
food B-TER
for O
me O
, O
and O
left O
after O
shaking O
my O
hand O
. O

Then O
I O
really O
believed O
that O
I O
would O
be O
released B-TER
in O
a O
few O
days O
. O

But O
I O
was O
to O
stay O
another O
eleven O
long O
, O
hard O
months O
, O
virtually O
put O
into O
cold O
storage O
. O

I O
had O
expected O
the O
affairs O
of O
a O
former O
KZ B-TER
prisoner B-TER
to O
be O
given O
priority O
treatment O
, O
but O
I O
was O
mistaken O
; O
there O
was O
no O
conference O
at O
all O
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
had O
overdone O
it O
by O
arresting B-TER
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
indiscriminately O
. O

They O
were O
simply O
not O
able O
to O
cope O
with O
these O
cases O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
I O
had O
been O
put O
back O
into O
section O
BIII O
and O
so O
I O
was O
starving B-TER
again O
. O

So O
I O
tried O
to O
obtain O
the O
Czech B-LOC
rations B-TER
I O
was O
entitled O
to O
. O

I O
asked O
to O
see O
the O
director O
, O
but O
the O
guard B-TER
took O
me O
to O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
instead O
. O

This O
man B-TER
listened O
to O
me O
… O
nothing O
happened O
! O
Section O
IIIB O
was O
run O
particularly O
badly O
, O
the O
guard B-TER
was O
the O
mere O
tool O
of O
the O
trusty O
, O
he O
did O
not O
care O
about O
anything O
. O

We O
even O
had O
to O
collect O
drinking O
water B-TER
from O
the O
toilet O
; O
I O
can O
well O
imagine O
that O
this O
was O
why O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

In O
April O
1946 O
I O
saw O
the O
director O
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
his O
rounds O
. O

I O
presented O
my O
request O
to O
him O
, O
he O
promised O
to O
examine O
my O
case O
, O
but O
nothing O
happened O
! O
When O
at O
last O
I O
had O
had O
enough O
I O
tried O
in O
vain O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
. O

This O
was O
not O
allowed O
but O
had O
the O
effect O
nevertheless O
that O
my O
situation O
was O
considered O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
transferred O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
because O
the O
people B-TER
in O
Prague B-LOC
did O
not O
dare O
to O
decide O
anything O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
continued O
to O
starve B-TER
until O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
felt O
sorry O
for O
me O
and O
sent O
me O
a O
parcel O
. O

This O
was O
not O
allowed O
either O
, O
but O
for O
a O
week O
I O
had O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
. O

On O
26 O
June O
1946 O
I O
was O
transferred B-TER
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

Leitmeritz B-LOC
was O
better O
organised O
than O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Immediately O
and O
urgently O
I O
demanded O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
which O
the O
guard B-TER
simply O
denied O
me O
, O
since O
I O
had O
not O
spoken O
to O
him O
in O
Czech B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
demanded O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
, O
he O
refused O
this O
too O
. O

The O
following O
week O
, O
however O
, O
I O
requested O
permission O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
. O

When O
I O
asked O
the O
director O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
write O
to O
the O
English B-LOC
ambassador B-TER
, O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
and O
to O
my O
son O
, O
he O
at O
once O
granted O
permission O
. O

Getting O
bolder O
, O
I O
asked O
for O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
which O
I O
received O
the O
same O
day O
. O

Now O
at O
last O
I O
had O
contact O
with O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
although O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
until O
I O
received O
an O
answer O
. O

On O
the O
day O
after O
my O
committal O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
I O
was O
presented O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
doctor B-TER
who O
realised O
how O
weakened O
I O
was O
, O
and O
promised O
at O
once O
that O
I O
would O
be O
put O
into O
the O
prison B-TER
hospital B-TER
as O
soon O
as O
there O
was O
a O
bed O
available O
. O

But O
before O
my O
admission O
I O
had O
a O
serious O
bout O
of O
enteritis B-TER
. O

At O
last O
, O
on O
9 O
August O
, O
I O
was O
admitted O
and O
stayed O
in O
this O
ward O
until O
my O
release B-TER
on O
9 O
January O
1947 O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
came O
across O
guards B-TER
who O
had O
stayed O
humane O
. O

Prohaska B-PER
and O
Faltin B-PER
, O
two O
young O
guards B-TER
who O
had O
suffered O
themselves O
under O
the O
Germans B-LOC
and O
therefore O
knew O
how O
a O
prisoner B-TER
felt O
. O

But O
there O
were O
also O
others O
: O
the O
worst O
ones O
were O
probably O
Adamczyk B-PER
and O
Pfeifer B-PER
. O

The O
latter O
treated O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
called O
Seifert B-PER
on O
his O
arrival O
by O
forcing O
him O
to O
lie O
in O
a O
bath O
filled O
with O
cold O
water O
. O

He O
was O
made O
to O
put O
his O
feet O
out O
, O
and O
Pfeifer B-PER
tortured B-TER
them O
so O
badly O
that O
Seifert B-PER
passed O
out O
. O

Seifert B-PER
never O
recovered O
from O
this O
maltreatment B-TER
, O
and O
died B-TER
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
1946 O
. O

Although O
as O
an O
Austrian B-LOC
he O
was O
entitled O
to O
Czech B-LOC
food B-TER
, O
he O
did O
not O
get O
it O
, O
nor O
was O
he O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
as O
he O
had O
requested O
. O

Adamczyk B-PER
shattered O
a O
boy O
’s O
eardrum B-TER
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
not O
knowing O
the O
Czech B-LOC
language O
was O
the O
worst O
that O
could O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
men B-TER
were O
able O
to O
gain O
many O
an O
advantage O
thanks O
to O
their O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
language O
. O

Even O
worse O
then O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
the O
trusties O
, O
though O
they O
were O
prisoners B-TER
themselves O
. O

They O
were O
chosen O
by O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

The O
trusties O
distributed O
the O
food B-TER
and O
whoever O
could O
pay O
with O
a O
cigarette O
got O
more O
food B-TER
and O
more O
bread B-TER
, O
naturally O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
those O
who O
did O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
offer O
. O

That O
the O
guards B-TER
were O
bad O
psychologists O
is O
surely O
proved O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
of O
the O
trusties O
was O
hanged O
and O
another O
one O
was O
sentenced O
to O
ten O
years O
’ O
hard O
labour B-TER
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
trusties O
beat O
their O
fellow O
prisoners B-TER
in O
order O
to O
gain O
the O
respect O
of O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

In O
Prague B-LOC
- O
Pancrace B-LOC
I O
was O
in O
four O
different O
sections O
. O

Only O
one O
, O
section O
A11 O
, O
was O
properly O
organised O
, O
although O
this O
was O
the O
German B-LOC
section O
. O

Every O
day O
we O
received O
a O
jug O
of O
drinking O
water B-TER
, O
a O
bucket O
of O
water O
for O
washing O
, O
and O
more O
drinking O
water B-TER
several O
times O
on O
hot O
days O
. O

Each O
cell B-TER
had O
a O
jug O
and O
a O
bucket O
, O
something O
no O
other O
section O
had O
to O
offer O
. O

There O
were O
also O
enough O
blankets O
and O
palliasses O
[ O
straw O
mattresses O
] O
in O
section O
AII O
and O
they O
were O
well O
kept O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
Prohaska B-PER
saw O
to O
it O
that O
the O
palliasses O
were O
refilled O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
that O
the O
dust O
was O
beaten O
out O
of O
the O
blankets O
. O

In O
section O
A1 O
the O
palliasses O
were O
in O
a O
bad O
state O
and O
there O
were O
not O
enough O
of O
them O
: O
seven O
men B-TER
had O
to O
share O
three O
. O

Section O
BIII O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
. O

There O
had O
been O
only O
two O
palliasses O
for O
seven O
men B-TER
until O
we O
gave O
some O
cigarettes O
[ O
in O
exchange O
] O
for O
two O
extra O
palliasses O
, O
and O
even O
for O
blankets O
! O
Although O
when O
we O
had O
asked O
before O
for O
blankets O
and O
palliasses O
the O
guard B-TER
had O
told O
us O
he O
had O
not O
got O
any O
. O

Cigarettes O
were O
the O
keys O
to O
every O
door O
! O
From O
about O
April O
1946 O
smoking O
was O
officially O
permitted O
in O
Pancrace B-LOC
but O
only O
for O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

But O
this O
ban O
for O
Germans B-LOC
was O
not O
observed O
too O
strictly O
since O
it O
meant O
a O
good O
income O
. O

The O
daily O
ration O
was O
two O
cigarettes O
but O
the O
cigarettes O
which O
arrived O
in O
the O
parcels O
– O
and O
there O
were O
fifty O
in O
each O
parcel O
– O
usually O
were O
not O
sufficient O
until O
the O
next O
delivery O
because O
there O
were O
too O
many O
fellow O
smokers O
. O

Many O
workers B-TER
brought O
cigarettes O
from O
outside O
into O
their O
cells B-TER
. O

That O
was O
forbidden O
, O
and O
there O
were O
daily O
body O
searches O
, O
but O
they O
still O
succeeded O
. O

Often O
the O
cigarettes O
were O
confiscated O
but O
just O
as O
often O
the O
workers B-TER
succeeded O
in O
tricking O
the O
guards B-TER
. O

It O
was O
a O
daily O
struggle O
between O
guard B-TER
and O
prisoner B-TER
. O

First O
the O
guard B-TER
won O
, O
then O
the O
prisoner B-TER
. O

Often O
good O
- O
natured O
guards B-TER
let O
the O
cigarettes O
through O
. O

Once O
even O
a O
razor O
was O
smuggled B-TER
into O
the O
cell B-TER
, O
although O
the O
prisoner B-TER
had O
been O
stripped O
. O

Once O
a O
German O
played O
a O
nasty O
trick O
on O
me O
. O

He O
put O
a O
pencil O
into O
my O
pocket O
without O
me O
noticing O
. O

The O
pencil O
was O
found O
, O
of O
course O
, O
at O
a O
control O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
must O
have O
seen O
from O
my O
surprised O
expression O
that O
I O
was O
dumbfounded O
. O

He O
did O
not O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
, O
otherwise O
this O
would O
have O
meant O
being O
put O
into O
a O
darkened O
cell B-TER
for O
me O
. O

In O
section O
AII O
there O
were O
strict O
rules O
about O
hygiene B-TER
– O
we O
had O
to O
shave O
and O
have O
a O
bath O
once O
a O
week O
; O
but O
this O
was O
not O
the O
case O
in O
the O
other O
sections O
. O

Those O
who O
worked B-TER
outside O
usually O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
shaved O
, O
which O
they O
used O
liberally O
. O

Such O
criminals B-TER
we O
were O
! O
Smoking O
was O
of O
course O
strictly O
forbidden O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
, O
but O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
cell B-TER
where O
we O
did O
not O
smoke O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
smoking O
was O
generally O
forbidden O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
people B-TER
smoked O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
described O
how O
we O
managed O
, O
not O
having O
any O
matches O
. O

Necessity O
is O
the O
mother O
of O
invention O
. O

In O
Pancrace B-LOC
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
play O
games O
like O
chess O
, O
dominoes O
, O
and O
nine O
men O
’s O
morris O
A O
board O
game O
for O
two O
players O
, O
also O
known O
as O
merels O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
this O
was O
forbidden O
, O
but O
we O
still O
played O
. O

Many O
a O
guard B-TER
turned O
a O
blind O
eye O
to O
this O
, O
others O
used O
it O
as O
a O
welcome O
opportunity O
to O
hit O
us O
. O

There O
was O
one O
guard B-TER
who O
searched O
the O
cell B-TER
every O
day O
; O
what O
he O
permitted O
one O
day O
he O
forbade O
the O
next O
. O

I O
had O
two O
bottles O
of O
different O
medicines B-TER
. O

He O
ordered O
me O
to O
pour O
these O
together O
into O
one O
bottle O
and O
give O
the O
second O
bottle O
to O
him O
. O

A O
small O
aluminium O
mug O
in O
which O
I O
kept O
my O
false O
teeth O
he O
threw O
away O
, O
telling O
me O
I O
could O
use O
my O
drinking O
mug O
instead O
. O

This O
man B-TER
was O
small O
and O
stunted O
with O
a O
deeply O
rooted O
inferiority O
complex O
. O

Here O
the O
guard B-TER
Prohaska B-PER
was O
remarkable O
for O
his O
correct O
behaviour O
. O

His O
demeanour O
was O
always O
measured O
, O
he O
never O
shouted O
, O
he O
was O
always O
a O
decent O
chap O
, O
a O
praiseworthy O
exception O
! O
Never O
lazy O
, O
nothing O
was O
too O
much O
[ O
trouble O
] O
for O
him O
and O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
the O
prisoners B-TER
’ I-TER
reactions O
. O

When O
Prohaska B-PER
was O
on O
duty O
the O
workers B-TER
never O
brought O
cigarettes O
back O
with O
them O
, O
and O
when O
he O
unexpectedly O
had O
to O
do O
an O
extra O
shift O
nobody O
smoked O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
. O

Nobody O
wanted O
to O
get O
him O
into O
trouble O
, O
since O
there O
was O
always O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
snap O
check O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
it O
was O
really O
unpleasant O
that O
we O
did O
not O
have O
wc O
’s O
in O
the O
cells B-TER
. O

It O
was O
particularly O
unpleasant O
on O
Saturdays O
and O
Sundays O
. O

On O
these O
days O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
locked O
by O
noon O
, O
and O
they O
were O
not O
opened O
again O
until O
the O
following O
day O
. O

So O
we O
had O
to O
make O
do O
with O
one O
toilet O
bucket O
which O
was O
just O
big O
enough O
for O
one O
man B-TER
. O

That O
was O
impossible O
, O
as O
we O
all O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

Once O
a O
man B-TER
came O
into O
the O
cell B-TER
at O
6 O
pm O
. O

I O
asked O
him O
to O
let O
us O
slop O
out O
[ O
empty O
the O
bucket O
] O
because O
the O
bucket O
was O
overflowing O
. O

He O
refused O
, O
and O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
use O
our O
washbasin O
too O
. O

Even O
today O
I O
wonder O
why O
there O
was O
no O
epidemic B-TER
. O

When O
Prohaska B-PER
was O
on O
duty O
he O
came O
without O
being O
asked O
, O
and O
let O
us O
empty O
the O
bucket O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
there O
was O
no O
drinking O
water B-TER
in O
the O
cells B-TER
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
take O
water B-TER
from O
the O
bucket O
which O
was O
used O
for O
cleaning O
the O
cell B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
all O
of O
us O
suffered O
from O
diarrhoea B-TER
. O

Washing O
clothes B-TER
was O
also O
a O
problem O
under O
these O
circumstances O
. O

Some O
guards B-TER
allowed O
us O
to O
rinse O
our O
washing O
in O
the O
laundry B-TER
but O
most O
did O
not O
. O

We O
were O
dependent O
on O
moods O
! O
I O
leave O
it O
to O
the O
reader O
to O
imagine O
what O
sometimes O
resulted O
from O
these O
conditions O
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
exercise O
in O
the O
prison B-TER
yard O
was O
also O
on O
the O
agenda O
, O
but O
often O
, O
far O
too O
often O
, O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
instead O
, O
and O
often O
daily O
for O
a O
whole O
week O
, O
so O
that O
we O
had O
to O
do O
without O
the O
necessary O
fresh O
air O
. O

Very O
often O
the O
exercise O
was O
anything O
but O
recreation O
: O
we O
were O
hounded O
as O
if O
we O
had O
to O
set O
a O
record O
. O

Then O
we O
returned O
to O
our O
cell B-TER
, O
completely O
exhausted O
. O

We O
threw O
ourselves O
down O
onto O
the O
floor O
because O
sitting O
on O
the O
palliasses O
was O
forbidden O
. O

Often O
after O
such O
an O
event O
the O
cells B-TER
were O
searched O
as O
well O
. O

Every O
guard B-TER
was O
a O
law O
unto O
himself O
. O

One O
allowed O
paper O
cartons O
to O
put O
the O
washing O
in O
, O
another O
threw O
them O
out O
. O

A O
few O
allowed O
us O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
palliasses O
since O
there O
was O
only O
one O
stool O
and O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
room O
for O
so O
many O
prisoners B-TER
to O
sit O
down O
. O

There O
were O
guards B-TER
who O
were O
really O
inventive O
as O
far O
as O
torturing B-TER
us O
during O
our O
exercise O
periods O
was O
concerned O
. O

When O
I O
said O
once O
to O
a O
guard B-TER
that O
the O
treatment O
here O
was O
worse O
than O
in O
the O
KZ B-TER
, O
he O
answered O
that O
it O
was O
in O
a O
KZ B-TER
that O
he O
had O
learnt O
it O
. O

From O
then O
, O
whenever O
he O
was O
on O
duty O
I O
had O
to O
keep O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O

As O
already O
mentioned O
I O
could O
have O
sent O
letters B-TER
if O
I O
had O
had O
stamps O
or O
money B-TER
. O

But O
how O
could O
I O
get O
money B-TER
or O
stamps O
? O
That O
was O
sheer O
sadism O
. O

They O
had O
taken O
away O
my O
450 O
Czech B-LOC
crowns B-TER
. O

Now O
I O
wrote O
some O
letters B-TER
and O
mentioned O
this O
money B-TER
. O

Some O
months O
later O
the O
trusty O
showed O
me O
the O
letters B-TER
– O
they O
had O
not O
been O
posted O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
had O
not O
even O
tried O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
find O
another O
way O
to O
order O
a O
food B-TER
parcel O
– O
we O
could O
not O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
. O

So O
I O
wanted O
to O
smuggle B-TER
a O
letter B-TER
out O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
. O

I O
gave O
this O
letter B-TER
secretly O
to O
a O
Czech B-LOC
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
. O

A O
German B-LOC
fellow O
prisoner B-TER
who O
had O
been O
the O
Managing O
Director O
of O
the O
Raiffeisenbank B-ORG
in O
Prague B-LOC
gave O
me O
away O
. O

The O
guard B-TER
did O
slap O
me O
but O
he O
was O
fair O
and O
did O
not O
report O
me O
. O

I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
had O
been O
forced O
to O
write O
in O
order O
to O
get O
something O
to O
eat B-TER
, O
since O
he O
had O
not O
posted O
my O
letters B-TER
. O

Perhaps O
that O
was O
why O
he O
refrained O
from O
reporting O
me O
, O
and O
also O
because O
the O
letter B-TER
was O
addressed O
to O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

In O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
write O
letters B-TER
secretly O
because O
the O
director O
was O
generous O
in O
allowing O
us O
to O
send O
letters B-TER
; O
he O
even O
paid O
for O
my O
stamps O
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
relief O
to O
meet O
this O
man B-TER
– O
he O
treated O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
as O
human O
beings O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
every O
prisoner B-TER
had O
to O
tell O
the O
head O
warder B-TER
in O
advance O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
director O
about O
, O
so O
complaints O
were O
hardly O
possible O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
the O
director O
would O
have O
stopped O
that O
at O
once O
. O

I O
know O
about O
one O
case O
when O
the O
prisoner B-TER
invented O
something O
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
director O
. O

When O
at O
last O
he O
was O
received O
by O
the O
director O
he O
complained O
about O
being O
repeatedly O
maltreated O
. O

On O
the O
way O
back O
to O
his O
cell B-TER
the O
guard B-TER
led O
him O
to O
his O
office O
and O
mistreated O
the O
poor O
chap O
so O
much O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
back O
to O
his O
cell B-TER
. O

If O
the O
prisoners B-TER
had O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
do O
what O
they O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
according O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
rules O
or O
by O
the O
director O
there O
would O
have O
been O
fewer O
punishments B-TER
. O

The O
guard B-TER
was O
the O
power O
, O
the O
prisoner B-TER
had O
no O
rights O
. O

I O
will O
always O
have O
fond O
memories O
of O
the O
director O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
to O
him O
that O
I O
owed O
contact O
with O
my O
sons O
. O

On O
22 O
June O
1946 O
I O
wrote O
to O
the O
examining O
magistrate O
in O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
in O
order O
to O
learn O
what O
I O
was O
accused O
of O
, O
so O
that O
I O
might O
be O
able O
to O
comment O
on O
it O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
my O
arrest B-TER
. O

I O
received O
no O
reply O
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
the O
examining O
magistrate O
told O
me O
that O
he O
had O
never O
had O
a O
letter B-TER
from O
me O
, O
there O
had O
never O
been O
a O
file O
on O
me O
. O

On O
2 O
October O
I O
had O
a O
longer O
discussion O
with O
the O
guard B-TER
who O
was O
my O
boss O
. O

On O
the O
same O
day O
he O
brought O
me O
paper O
and O
ink O
, O
thus O
giving O
me O
the O
opportunity O
to O
submit O
a O
petition O
to O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
. O

He O
later O
handed O
it O
personally O
to O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
. O

Whenever O
he O
went O
off O
duty O
he O
took O
with O
him O
what O
I O
had O
written O
in O
order O
to O
give O
it O
back O
to O
me O
when O
he O
came O
to O
work B-TER
. O

In O
this O
petition O
I O
described O
my O
fate O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
and O
gave O
the O
names O
of O
about O
twenty O
Czechs B-LOC
who O
were O
in O
public O
life O
. O

The O
public O
prosecutor O
ordered O
these O
witnesses O
to O
be O
heard O
. O

Unfortunately O
they O
lived O
in O
different O
areas O
, O
all O
over O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
, O
and O
of O
course O
I O
did O
not O
know O
their O
precise O
addresses O
. O

So O
the O
whole O
procedure O
took O
longer O
than O
expected O
. O

My O
file O
was O
sent O
to O
Prague B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
witness O
General O
Dr O
Pollak B-PER
was O
heard O
, O
then O
they O
came O
back O
to O
Leitmeritz B-LOC
. O

After O
that O
they O
were O
sent O
to O
Brünn B-LOC
[ O
Brno B-LOC
] O
. O

When O
four O
of O
the O
witnesses O
named O
by O
me O
had O
been O
heard O
the O
public O
prosecutor O
did O
not O
want O
to O
listen O
to O
any O
others O
and O
ordered O
my O
release B-TER
. O

On O
9 O
January O
1947 O
I O
was O
taken O
before O
the O
examining O
magistrate O
who O
said O
to O
me O
: O
There O
is O
nothing O
here O
held O
against O
you O
, O
you O
may O
go O
wherever O
you O
wish O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Czechoslovakia O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
you O
should O
not O
. O

There O
are O
no O
restrictions O
. O

You O
are O
free O
! O
When O
I O
said O
to O
him O
that O
that O
would O
have O
been O
easier O
nineteen O
months O
ago O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
I O
am O
not O
responsible O
for O
this O
. O

I O
did O
not O
even O
know O
that O
you O
existed O
. O

I O
have O
never O
seen O
your O
file O
, O
there O
is O
n’t O
one O
. O

There O
is O
too O
much O
work O
for O
too O
few O
judges O
, O
which O
is O
completely O
preventing O
regular O
work O
. O

We O
dealt O
with O
those O
cases O
where O
the O
person O
concerned O
got O
in O
touch O
. O

The O
others O
did O
not O
get O
done O
. O

Unfortunately O
you O
were O
amongst O
these O
. O

That O
was O
pretty O
cold O
comfort O
! O
When O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
my O
case O
to O
be O
first O
to O
be O
dealt O
with O
, O
he O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
. O

He O
said O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
could O
understand O
my O
anger O
, O
particularly O
since O
I O
had O
suffered O
so O
much O
. O

But O
that O
would O
not O
help O
me O
. O

I O
should O
try O
to O
get O
compensation B-TER
for O
wrongful O
imprisonment B-TER
. O

There O
I O
was O
on O
the O
street O
, O
without O
any O
money B-TER
. O

An O
icy O
wind O
hit O
me O
. O

I O
did O
as O
the O
magistrate O
had O
suggested O
and O
went O
to O
the O
house O
he O
had O
described O
. O

And O
in O
this O
house O
lived O
a O
family B-TER
Bobeck B-PER
with O
whom O
I O
had O
been O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

They O
did O
not O
know O
that O
I O
had O
been O
in O
prison B-TER
, O
nor O
that O
I O
had O
been O
so O
very O
close O
by O
. O

They O
immediately O
offered O
me O
a O
room B-TER
and O
also O
a O
considerable O
sum O
of O
money B-TER
. O

I O
was O
safe O
! O
Two O
days O
later O
I O
went O
to O
Prague B-LOC
. O

Here O
I O
was O
given O
accommodation B-TER
by O
a O
Mr O
Paul B-PER
Schlesinger I-PER
, O
who O
had O
never O
met O
me O
before O
, O
having O
only O
heard O
about O
me O
. O

In O
the O
street O
I O
met O
people B-TER
I O
had O
known O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
none O
of O
whom O
knew O
I O
had O
been O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
accept O
all O
the O
invitations O
I O
received O
. O

First O
I O
had O
to O
get O
used O
to O
the O
good O
food B-TER
and O
all O
the O
hurly O
- O
burly O
. O

Only O
now O
did O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
was O
really O
free B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
my O
precipitate O
arrest B-TER
I O
had O
lost O
the O
few O
belongings O
the O
SS B-ORG
had O
left O
me O
. O

A O
petition O
to O
the O
Czechoslovakian B-LOC
government B-TER
was O
refused O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
decree B-TER
of O
President O
Benesch B-PER
. O

This O
decree B-TER
states O
that O
compensation B-TER
is O
not O
paid O
and O
that O
people B-TER
spreading O
libellous O
gossip O
must O
not O
be O
sued O
. O

But O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities O
, O
too O
, O
refused O
to O
pay O
any O
compensation B-TER
for O
nineteen O
months O
’ O
arrest B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
the O
Czechs B-LOC
provided O
me O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
support O
. O

They O
even O
offered O
me O
a O
pension O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
Republic B-LOC
. O

But O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
strong O
enough O
the O
ecumenical B-TER
organisation O
sent O
me O
to O
England B-LOC
by O
air O
. O
