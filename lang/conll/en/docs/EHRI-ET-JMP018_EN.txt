Berner B-PER
Isaak I-PER

18.6.1909 O
in O
Riga B-LOC
On O
July O
1st O
, O
1941 O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
came O
to O
Riga B-LOC
. O

On O
July O
2nd O
, O
an O
auxiliary O
Latvian B-LOC
SS B-TER
troop O
was O
formed O
. O

They O
wore O
green O
armbands O
on O
their O
sleeves O
with O
a O
skull O
on O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
this O
auxiliary O
troop O
did O
was O
to O
stop O
Jews O
in O
the O
street O
, O
to O
humiliate O
them O
, O
to O
throw O
Jewish O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
out O
of O
their O
apartments B-TER
and O
to O
force O
them O
to O
work B-TER
. O

Work B-TER
was O
done O
clearing O
up O
, O
where O
the O
aim O
was O
not O
so O
much O
that O
work B-TER
was O
done O
, O
but O
much O
more O
to O
tyrannise O
the O
Jews O
. O

Beards B-TER
were I-TER
pulled I-TER
out I-TER
, O
the O
women B-TER
had O
their O
hair O
cut O
off O
, O
beaten B-TER
and O
kicked O
, O
the O
people O
stayed O
lying O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

On O
July O
3rd O
, O
the O
apartments B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
began O
to O
be O
ransacked B-TER
. O

On O
July O
6th O
, O
all O
the O
synagogues B-TER
in O
Riga B-LOC
were B-TER
set I-TER
on I-TER
fire I-TER
. O

I O
can O
testify O
under O
oath O
that O
many O
rabbis B-TER
, O
cantors O
, O
temple O
assistants O
and O
families O
that O
lived O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
the O
synagogues B-TER
were O
forced O
into O
the O
burning B-TER
synagogues I-TER
and O
suffocated O
and O
burnt B-TER
alive O
. O

Shortly O
afterwards O
, O
the O
mass O
arrests O
began O
amongst O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

Over O
a O
short O
period O
, O
3000 O
- O
4000 O
Jews O
disappeared O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
happened O
to O
these O
people O
. O

All O
of O
the O
Jews O
that O
were O
still O
free O
had O
to O
register O
daily O
at O
the O
prefecture O
and O
were O
sent O
to O
work B-TER
, O
where O
they O
were O
– O
of O
course O
– O
tormented O
in O
the O
worst O
ways O
possible O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
September O
, O
Prefect O
Stieglitz B-PER
– O
a O
repatriated O
German B-TER
who O
had O
come O
back O
to O
Latvia B-LOC
– O
gathered O
all O
the O
leading O
Jewish O
men B-TER
and O
told O
them O
to O
form O
a O
Jewish O
committee O
. O

The O
members O
were O
the O
lawyer O
Dr. O
Eljachow B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Minz B-PER
Uncertain O
, O
whether O
he O
means O
Vladimir O
Mincs O
. O

, O
Kaugert B-PER
, O
Winzker B-PER
, O
Dr. O
Blumfeld B-PER
. O

Their O
task O
was O
: O
arranging O
for O
the O
relocation B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Riga B-LOC
to O
the O
working O
- O
class O
suburb O
of O
Letgaler B-LOC
, O
an O
area O
where O
originally O
3000 O
- O
4000 O
had O
lived O
. O

In O
this O
cramped O
area O
, O
in O
the O
small O
, O
low O
rooms B-TER
, O
30 O
- O
40,000 O
people O
had O
to O
find O
accommodation B-TER
. O

We O
had O
to O
give O
our O
apartments B-TER
to O
the O
people O
moving O
out O
of O
the O
working O
- O
class O
area O
without O
any O
compensation O
, O
and O
were O
only O
allowed O
to O
take O
essentials O
with O
us O
that O
we O
could O
carry O
; O
special O
permission O
was O
needed O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
take O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
cupboard O
with O
you O
. O

If O
it O
was O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
furniture O
, O
then O
the O
permission O
was O
n’t O
granted O
. O

The O
relocation B-TER
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
October O
15th O
, O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
was O
then O
fenced O
in O
, O
surrounded O
by O
Latvian B-TER
SS B-TER
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
segregated O
and O
the O
tragedy O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
began O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
first O
days O
, O
many O
Jews O
who O
only O
got O
too O
close O
to O
the O
fence O
were O
shot O
attempting O
to O
escape O
. O

Shots O
were O
fired O
into O
windows O
that O
were O
supposedly O
the O
black O
- O
out O
was O
not O
good O
enough O
, O
many O
people O
died B-TER
as O
a O
result O
. O

Work B-TER
commandos I-TER
left O
daily O
. O

Anyone O
who O
was O
halfway O
able O
to O
tried O
to O
avoid O
it O
, O
as O
returning O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
could O
be O
deadly O
. O

You O
were O
checked O
at O
the O
gate O
, O
searches O
were O
undertaken O
and O
most O
were O
beaten O
; O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
not O
spared O
. O

Groceries B-TER
and O
essentials O
were O
supplied O
by O
14 O
shops O
, O
but O
the O
allocation O
got O
less O
and O
less O
every O
week O
. O

Security O
was O
provided O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Police I-TER
. O

On O
November O
18th O
, O
it O
was O
arranged O
that O
the O
ghetto B-TER
would O
be O
evacuated B-TER
and O
everyone O
would O
be O
transferred B-TER
to O
a O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

When O
Dr O
Eljachow B-PER
asked O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
old O
and O
the O
sick B-TER
, O
an O
SA O
man O
named O
Schulze B-PER
answered O
bluntly O
that O
anyone O
who O
was O
unable O
to O
march O
would O
be O
shot B-TER
. O

We O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
20 O
kg O
of O
luggage O
with O
us O
. O

We O
believed O
that O
were O
really O
going O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
a O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

On O
November O
20th O
, O
Latvian B-LOC
workers O
came O
and O
isolated O
a O
small O
section O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

We O
did O
n’t O
know O
why O
they O
had O
done O
it O
, O
but O
on O
November O
23rd O
, O
all O
of O
the O
strong O
men B-TER
were O
forced O
into O
this O
isolated O
section O
. O

On O
November O
30th O
, O
the O
grosse O
Aktion O
( O
big O
action O
) O
began O
. O

At O
6 O
pm O
, O
children B-TER
, O
women B-TER
and O
old O
people O
– O
with O
or O
without O
luggage O
– O
were O
driven B-TER
out I-TER
of O
their O
apartments B-TER
. O

Blows B-TER
, O
kicks B-TER
, O
shooting B-TER
, O
murder B-TER
were O
the O
tactics O
used O
to O
prompt O
the O
terrified O
people O
. O

People O
stayed O
on O
the O
streets O
for O
the O
whole O
night O
, O
until O
6 O
am O
, O
in O
the O
frost O
, O
hungry B-TER
and O
many O
poorly O
dressed O
. O

A O
group O
of O
1000 O
people O
were O
marched O
on O
foot O
along O
the O
Moskauer B-LOC
Strasse I-LOC
( O
Moscow B-LOC
Street I-LOC
) O
under O
the O
strict O
supervision O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Nobody O
was O
allowed O
to O
watch O
, O
even O
Aryans B-TER
were O
n’t O
allowed O
to O
look O
out O
of O
the O
window O
as O
shots O
were O
immediately O
fired O
. O

This O
evacuation B-TER
lasted O
until O
December O
9th O
, O
1941 O
. O

During O
this O
time O
, O
those O
of O
us O
in O
the O
isolated O
part O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
heard O
that O
Russian O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
were O
digging O
pits B-TER
outside O
of O
town O
by O
Quadrat O
in O
Salasplis B-LOC
and O
in O
the O
Bickernjaken O
woods O
. O

We O
could O
n’t O
find O
out O
initially O
what O
they O
were O
for O
. O

We O
found O
out O
from O
farmers O
that O
lived O
nearby O
and O
from O
the O
statements O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
able O
to O
escape B-TER
: O
The O
transports B-TER
with O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
( O
and O
also O
several O
men B-TER
too O
) O
were O
forced O
to O
the O
pits B-TER
and O
mown B-TER
down I-TER
with O
machine O
guns O
. O

The O
screaming O
and O
wailing O
of O
the O
poor O
victims O
was O
so O
harrowing O
, O
that O
many O
farmers O
on O
the O
immediate O
area O
could O
n’t O
sleep O
for O
days O
. O

In O
this O
action O
, O
around O
27,000 O
women B-TER
, O
around O
3000 O
children B-TER
between O
1 O
and O
13 O
years O
as O
well O
as O
4000 O
- O
5000 O
men B-TER
who O
were O
less O
able O
to O
work O
were O
murdered B-TER
. O

The O
whole O
Aktion O
was O
led O
by O
General O
Jeckeln B-PER
, O
who O
was O
based O
in O
the O
Knight O
’s O
Hall O
in O
Riga B-LOC
with O
his O
accomplices O
, O
Dr O
Lange B-PER
and O
the O
SA O
man O
Schulze B-PER
. O

To O
the O
character O
of O
General O
Jeckeln B-PER
I O
want O
to O
add O
: O
when O
several O
Jews O
were O
sent O
to O
his O
house O
to O
work B-TER
for O
him O
, O
he O
did O
n’t O
like O
two O
of O
them O
. O

Out O
of O
nowhere O
he O
shot B-TER
them O
. O

After O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Aktion O
, O
nearly O
5000 O
men B-TER
and O
around O
270 O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
who O
had O
been O
able O
to O
hide B-TER
during O
the O
evacuation B-TER
remained O
in O
the O
small O
isolated O
section O
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

I O
was O
the O
camp O
elder O
at O
the O
time O
and O
got O
permission O
from O
the O
commandants B-TER
to O
bring O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
into O
a O
special O
block O
, O
and O
later O
other O
women B-TER
from O
Latvia B-LOC
came O
as O
well O
. O

There O
was O
a O
total O
of O
500 O
- O
600 O
women B-TER
in O
the O
women B-TER
’s O
block O
. O

The O
new O
commandant B-TER
was O
called O
Obersturmführer B-TER
Krauss B-PER
, O
his O
assistant O
was O
SS B-TER
Scharführer B-TER
Roschmann B-PER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
designated O
a O
barrack/ O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
all O
the O
inmates B-TER
had O
to O
work B-TER
without O
rest O
. O

Three O
shops O
were O
set O
up O
and O
we O
received O
food B-TER
rationing I-TER
cards O
, O
concerning O
goods O
, O
there O
was O
only O
that O
which O
was O
left O
over O
from O
the O
shops O
in O
the O
large O
ghetto B-TER
. O

Almost O
everyone O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
day O
. O

The O
large O
ghetto B-TER
was O
taken O
over O
by O
a O
trust O
, O
and O
the O
property O
found O
there O
was O
sold O
in O
packages O
for O
15 O
marks O
to O
the O
local O
population O
, O
whole O
wagons O
full O
of O
clothes O
were O
sent O
to O
Germany B-TER
as O
winter O
assistance O
from O
the O
Latvian B-LOC
people O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
kept O
the O
best O
things O
for O
themselves O
. O

Three O
days O
after O
the O
annihilation O
action O
, O
13 O
- O
14,000 O
Jews O
from O
Germany B-TER
( O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
children B-TER
) O
were O
brought O
to O
the O
ghetto B-TER
that O
we O
had O
cleared O
out O
. O

They O
were O
brought O
from O
Germany B-TER
to O
Szirotowa O
in O
first O
and O
second O
- O
class O
carriages O
and O
given O
coffee O
there O
by O
nurses B-TER
from O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

They O
had O
been O
given O
permission O
to O
bring O
luggage O
with O
them O
from O
Germany B-TER
and O
so O
arrived O
quite O
well O
- O
equipped O
. O

In O
Szirotowa O
they O
were O
sorted O
with O
blows O
and O
beatings O
. O

The O
men B-TER
were O
mostly O
sent O
to O
Salaspils B-LOC
to O
the O
work B-TER
/ O
annihilation B-TER
camp B-TER
, O
some O
of O
the O
old O
people O
were O
shot B-TER
in O
Szirotowa O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
brought O
as O
mentioned O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
. O

All O
of O
their O
luggage O
was O
stolen O
and O
they O
lived O
from O
what O
they O
got O
from O
us O
. O

It O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
, O
that O
we O
left O
the O
work B-TER
camp I-TER
and O
went O
into O
the O
ghetto B-TER
, O
and O
the O
inhabitants B-TER
of O
the O
ghetto B-TER
were O
also O
not O
allowed O
to O
come O
into O
contact O
with O
us O
. O

We O
went O
to O
work B-TER
every O
day O
. O

Every O
Jew O
in O
the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
had O
to O
deliver O
money O
, O
valuables O
, O
stocks O
and O
gold O
. O

We O
surrendered O
115,000 O
marks O
and O
a O
fortune O
in O
gold O
, O
jewellery O
and O
diamonds O
. O

The O
worth O
is O
difficult O
to O
estimate O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fortune O
. O

Eight O
days O
later O
, O
the O
first O
two O
Jews O
were O
publically O
hanged B-TER
in O
the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
. O

One O
was O
found O
to O
have O
60 O
pfennigs O
and O
the O
other O
1 O
mark O
. O

After O
the O
execution B-TER
was O
carried O
out O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
ordered O
to O
carry O
out O
another O
collection O
of O
money O
, O
golds O
and O
valuables O
, O
as O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
not O
everything O
had O
been O
handed O
over O
. O

We O
immediately O
carried O
out O
another O
collection O
and O
raised O
80,000 O
marks O
. O

As O
a O
personal O
gift O
for O
the O
Commandant B-TER
Krause B-PER
, O
we O
kept O
some O
diamonds O
, O
a O
gold O
clock O
and O
cigarette O
case O
to O
one O
side O
for O
him O
. O

It O
was O
said O
, O
that O
he O
refused O
the O
gift O
and O
threw O
it O
into O
the O
basket O
with O
all O
the O
other O
things O
. O

A O
constable O
said O
later O
, O
that O
Krause B-PER
took O
enough O
things O
that O
he O
could O
live O
from O
them O
for O
100 O
years O
. O

The O
hangings B-TER
and O
shootings B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
had O
n’t O
stopped O
; O
for O
every O
small O
infraction O
, O
someone O
had O
to O
pay O
with O
their O
life B-TER
. O

The O
executions B-TER
by O
hanging O
had O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
Jewish B-TER
Police I-TER
who O
were O
left O
in O
the O
barrack O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
in O
Riga B-LOC
carried O
out O
many O
arrests O
amongst O
us O
, O
especially O
from O
important O
businessmen O
or O
industrial O
people O
. O

These O
people O
disappeared O
and O
never O
came O
back O
. O

Within O
a O
year O
, O
1000 O
Jews O
had O
been O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
camp B-TER
existed O
until O
1943 O
- O
06 O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
it O
was O
disbanded O
and O
we O
were O
housed B-TER
in O
groups O
at O
the O
companies O
that O
we O
were O
working B-TER
for O
, O
in O
barracks B-TER
and O
under O
stricter O
guard O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
people B-TER
were O
taken O
to O
the O
newly O
founded O
Kaiserwalde O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
near O
Riga B-LOC
. O

Food B-TER
was O
quite O
scarce O
in O
the O
factory O
camp B-TER
, O
but O
there O
was O
enough O
to O
keep O
you O
alive O
and O
not O
have O
to O
starve B-TER
. O

As O
the O
Russians B-ORG
approached O
, O
we O
were O
taken O
to O
Germany B-LOC
and O
housed B-TER
in O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O
