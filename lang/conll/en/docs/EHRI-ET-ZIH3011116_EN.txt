When O
the O
war B-TER
broke O
out O
I O
was O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
with O
my O
mommy B-TER
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

There O
was O
a O
blockade O
– O
I O
was O
with O
mommy B-TER
and O
other O
people O
in O
a O
cellar B-TER
, O
there O
was O
a O
trapdoor O
there O
and O
it O
was O
covered O
with O
rags O
and O
a O
certain O
man O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
house O
had O
a O
bell O
and O
he O
rang O
when O
there O
was O
danger O
, O
for O
people O
to O
be O
quiet O
and O
hide O
better O
. O

The O
Germans B-TER
came O
and O
found O
different O
people O
in O
the O
cellar B-TER
in O
different O
hide B-TER
- I-TER
outs I-TER
, O
but O
ours O
was O
the O
best O
and O
they O
did O
n’t O
find O
us O
. O

Later O
when O
we O
found O
out O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
make O
soap O
from O
us O
, O
we O
went O
to O
a O
certain O
lady O
, O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
factory B-TER
and O
we O
lodged O
with O
her O
, O
and O
the O
next O
day O
we O
went O
to O
my O
cousin O
’s O
. O

Also O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
when O
we O
drove O
by O
the O
sentry O
, O
mommy B-TER
covered O
me O
with O
a O
blanket O
. O

We O
were O
there O
2 O
to O
3 O
days O
, O
we O
called O
uncle B-TER
up O
, O
who O
was O
in O
the O
city O
as O
an O
Aryan B-TER
, O
a O
Volksdeutsch B-TER
, O
and O
we O
arranged O
how O
to O
send O
me O
. O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
so O
nobody O
would O
see O
, O
my O
cousin B-TER
and O
another O
man B-TER
threw O
me O
and O
one O
girl B-TER
over O
the O
wall O
. O

My O
cousin B-TER
lifted O
me O
up O
on O
the O
ladder O
and O
passed O
me O
onto O
a O
man B-TER
who O
stood O
on O
a O
stool O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

There O
was O
no O
glass O
in O
that O
place O
. O

I O
was O
then O
6 O
or O
7 O
years O
old O
. O

Mommy B-TER
could O
n’t O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
because O
she O
did O
n’t O
have O
money O
. O

A O
woman B-TER
sent O
there O
by O
my O
uncle B-TER
approached O
me O
. O

She O
said O
: O
Come O
with O
me O
. O

We O
got O
into O
the O
carriage O
, O
but O
because O
it O
was O
late O
, O
a O
policeman B-TER
stopped O
us O
and O
told O
us O
to O
show O
our O
papers O
. O

The O
men B-TER
, O
who O
were O
in O
the O
carriage O
showed O
theirs O
, O
and O
the O
woman B-TER
took O
me O
by O
the O
hand O
and O
we O
escaped O
to O
the O
barber O
shop O
. O

It O
was O
fortunate O
that O
they O
stopped O
the O
carriage O
right O
there O
, O
because O
the O
lady B-TER
had O
keys O
to O
the O
shop O
. O

We O
lodged O
there O
sitting O
in O
our O
clothes O
. O

In O
the O
morning O
we O
went O
to O
the O
lady B-TER
’s O
apartment O
, O
I O
had O
some O
sleep O
and O
then O
we O
went O
by O
tramway O
to O
a O
certain O
woman B-TER
and O
my O
uncle B-TER
came O
there O
. O

My O
uncle B-TER
cleaned O
me O
and O
took O
me O
to O
where O
he O
lived B-TER
; O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
there O
, O
but O
it O
was O
impossible O
, O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
used O
to O
come O
by O
there O
. O

Uncle B-TER
took O
me O
to O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

After O
that O
they O
wanted O
to O
give O
me O
to O
my O
aunt B-TER
’s O
acquaintance O
, O
but O
she O
said O
that O
her O
husband O
would O
n’t O
agree O
and O
that O
she O
knew O
another O
, O
a O
better O
one O
. O

She O
led O
me O
to O
that O
one O
and O
I O
was O
there O
maybe O
a O
year O
. O

It O
was O
good O
for O
me O
, O
uncle B-TER
used O
to O
come O
to O
me O
. O

I O
never O
went O
out O
, O
just O
sat O
in O
the O
room O
. O

Once O
my O
auntie B-TER
came O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
, O
she O
stayed O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Auntie B-TER
sent O
to O
us O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
, O
who O
was O
sick B-TER
and O
had O
ulcers B-TER
, O
a O
Jewess O
and O
later O
a O
man B-TER
sent O
another O
Jewess O
. O

It O
was O
crowded O
and O
that O
lady B-TER
left O
. O

But O
she O
found O
out O
what O
they O
did O
to O
me O
. O

( O
when O
asked O
, O
he O
adds O
that O
something O
was O
done O
so O
that O
he O
would O
not O
be O
recognized O
as O
a O
Jew O
) O
and O
that O
the O
surgeon B-TER
, O
who O
cured O
that O
woman B-TER
’s O
ulcers B-TER
, O
did O
it O
. O

She O
sent O
to O
us O
a O
man B-TER
, O
who O
came O
and O
asked O
if O
there O
was O
a O
boy B-TER
and O
the O
mistress O
heard O
him O
wrong O
and O
asked O
: O
what O
? O
woman B-TER
? O
Then O
he O
said O
: O
Aha O
! O
There O
is O
a O
boy O
and O
a O
woman O
! O
He O
came O
into O
our O
room O
, O
told O
us O
to O
go O
with O
him O
, O
he O
took O
away O
her O
neck O
chain O
and O
500 O
zloty O
, O
that O
she O
had O
in O
possession O
and O
a O
coat B-TER
. O

He O
told O
me O
to O
show O
him O
what O
should O
n’t O
be O
shown O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
would O
come O
for O
us O
at O
12 O
. O

He O
was O
also O
a O
Jew O
. O

We O
escaped B-TER
. O

I O
and O
the O
host O
to O
a O
certain O
lady B-TER
’ O
s. O
There O
I O
came O
across O
that O
lady B-TER
who O
instigated O
the O
search O
against O
us O
, O
and O
a O
man B-TER
similar O
to O
the O
one O
who O
was O
at O
us O
. O

He O
asked O
about O
the O
other O
one O
, O
how O
tall O
he O
was O
, O
how O
was O
he O
dressed O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
3 O
weeks O
. O

Then O
my O
auntie B-TER
took O
me O
away O
from O
there O
and O
gave O
me O
to O
another O
lady B-TER
. O

Again O
this O
ill B-TER
lady B-TER
was O
afraid O
that O
something O
would O
break O
out O
and O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
close O
to O
her O
and O
she O
moved O
me O
to O
Piusa B-LOC
Street I-LOC
, O
because O
she O
was O
on O
Marszałkowska B-LOC
, O
so O
I O
would O
be O
close O
to O
her O
. O

When O
the O
uprising B-TER
broke O
out O
, O
auntie B-TER
just O
brought O
milk B-TER
for O
me O
and O
came O
to O
us O
. O

The O
husband B-TER
of O
the O
lady B-TER
, O
at O
whose O
I O
was O
, O
was O
a O
company O
sergeant O
in O
the O
uprising B-TER
. O

When O
the O
Germans B-TER
told O
us O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
went O
with O
the O
whole O
house O
to O
the O
railway O
station O
, O
we O
lost O
one O
another O
, O
I O
almost O
lost O
my O
aunt B-TER
, O
because O
it O
was O
heavy O
with O
the O
knapsack O
and O
I O
walked O
slowly O
, O
but O
I O
called O
her O
and O
held O
her O
hand O
. O

We O
went O
via O
a O
goods O
train B-TER
to O
Pruszków B-LOC
, O
we O
were O
there O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
were O
in O
a O
ward O
, O
where O
the O
Russians B-TER
were O
, O
they O
played O
very O
nice O
. O

When O
we O
were O
leaving O
those O
Russians B-TER
had O
tears O
in O
their O
eyes O
. O

We O
went O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
nights O
, O
they O
let O
us O
out O
in O
Łazy B-LOC
because O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
go O
out O
, O
but O
they O
led O
us O
under O
machine O
guns O
. O

People O
in O
Łazy B-LOC
said O
that O
we O
were O
going O
for O
death B-TER
. O

They O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
take O
us O
in O
Oświęcim B-LOC
, O
they O
were O
burning B-TER
120 O
000 O
people O
a O
day O
and O
did O
n’t O
have O
room O
. O

They O
detrained O
us O
in O
Mszana B-LOC
and O
from O
there O
we O
went O
to O
Kraków B-LOC
. O

Now O
I O
am O
with O
my O
auntie B-TER
, O
we O
are O
looking O
for O
her O
husband B-TER
and O
the O
whole O
family B-TER
and O
for O
that O
man B-TER
who O
wanted O
to O
kill B-TER
us O
. O

Now O
