Children B-TER
Children B-TER
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
right O
with O
the O
first O
transports B-TER
from O
Brno B-LOC
and O
Prague B-LOC
in O
1941 O
. O

Thanks O
to O
Gonda B-PER
Redlich I-PER
and O
Fredy B-PER
Hirsch I-PER
, O
who O
, O
faithful O
to O
the O
tradition O
of O
the O
youth B-TER
movement O
that O
they O
were O
part O
of O
when O
they O
were O
young O
, O
immediately O
brought O
these O
children B-TER
under O
their O
wing O
and O
procured O
better O
conditions O
for O
them O
in O
this O
worst O
of O
places O
, O
the O
first O
special O
rooms O
for O
children B-TER
were O
soon O
created O
and O
, O
later O
, O
in O
February O
1942 O
, O
the O
first O
Home B-TER
for I-TER
Children I-TER
. O

Several O
people O
from O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
administration O
understood O
the O
responsibility O
we O
had O
towards O
the O
children B-TER
and O
we O
tried O
to O
find O
all O
kinds O
of O
ways O
to O
make O
their O
life O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
easier O
. O

It O
was O
once O
again O
our O
Jakub B-PER
Edelstein I-PER
who O
, O
in O
the O
difficult O
and O
important O
discussion O
at O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
over O
whose O
slice B-TER
of I-TER
bread I-TER
would O
be O
shortened O
or O
whose O
portion O
increased O
, O
swayed O
the O
decision O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
children B-TER
with O
his O
courageous O
and O
lucid O
analysis O
. O

This O
perhaps O
unusually O
and O
cruelly O
disadvantaged O
the O
old B-TER
, O
but O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do O
; O
it O
guaranteed O
a O
better O
future O
for O
the O
Jewish O
nation O
. O

This O
decision O
by O
the O
Council B-ORG
of I-ORG
Elders I-ORG
trickled O
down O
to O
all O
of O
the O
barracks B-TER
, O
kitchens O
, O
and O
streets O
. O

Everywhere O
, O
children B-TER
came O
under O
special O
care O
, O
they O
were O
given O
advantages O
, O
and O
if O
there O
was O
a O
happy O
sight O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
it O
was O
surely O
the O
happily O
playing O
children B-TER
, O
who O
seemed O
so O
carefree O
. O

But O
those O
who O
worked O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
with O
the O
children B-TER
knew O
how O
sometimes O
a O
child B-TER
’s I-TER
eyes O
would O
glisten O
, O
knew O
the O
look O
that O
asked O
why O
? O
to O
which O
no O
caretaker O
knew O
an O
appropriate O
because O
, O
knew O
that O
when O
the O
children B-TER
woke O
up O
at O
night O
they O
opened O
their O
eyes O
and O
saw O
an O
empty O
darkness O
, O
sometimes O
heard O
their O
silent O
crying O
that O
no O
medicine O
could O
cure O
, O
knew O
the O
complications O
and O
tragedy O
of O
a O
Jewish O
child B-TER
and O
its O
soul O
. O

No O
textbook O
of O
psychology O
exists O
yet O
that O
can O
teach O
us O
how O
to O
soothe O
them O
. O

For O
the O
children B-TER
, O
life O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
was O
led O
separately O
from O
the O
rest O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
principles O
of O
collective O
education B-TER
, O
the O
individual O
rooms O
constituted O
closed O
homes B-TER
, O
which O
set O
and O
managed O
their O
daily O
schedule O
. O

Besides O
their O
lessons O
, O
the O
children B-TER
had O
to O
do O
domestic O
work O
and O
organized O
frequent O
evening O
programs O
. O

The O
caretakers O
lived B-TER
with O
the O
children B-TER
and O
thus O
they O
could O
significantly O
influence O
their O
whole O
lives O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
there O
were O
very O
few O
qualified O
people O
, O
and O
the O
caretaker O
's O
incompetence O
sometimes O
led O
to O
a O
difficult O
crisis O
in O
the O
home B-TER
. O

When O
the O
number O
of O
children B-TER
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
reached O
its O
peak O
, O
i.e. O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
1943 O
, O
there O
were O
2,300 O
children B-TER
aged O
4 O
- O
18 O
receiving O
child O
care O
in O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

Health B-TER
services I-TER
took O
care O
of O
children B-TER
younger O
than O
age O
4 O
, O
placing O
them O
either O
in O
the O
home B-TER
for O
infants B-TER
or O
in O
the O
home O
for O
toddlers B-TER
together O
with O
their O
mothers O
and O
the O
staff O
. O

Children B-TER
were O
not O
forced O
to O
move B-TER
into O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

The O
open O
youth B-TER
care O
looked O
after O
children B-TER
who O
were O
outside O
of O
the O
homes B-TER
. O

The O
institution O
of O
open O
care O
consisted O
of O
the O
home B-TER
for O
mothers O
and O
children B-TER
( O
without O
a O
staff O
) O
, O
and O
Czech O
, O
German O
, O
and O
Hebrew O
kindergartens O
, O
attended O
by O
more O
than O
500 O
children B-TER
. O

Social O
nurses O
were O
also O
part O
of O
the O
open O
youth O
care O
. O

Children B-TER
regularly O
visited O
them O
, O
and O
the O
nurses O
performed O
health O
check O
- O
ups O
and O
arranged O
all O
that O
was O
necessary O
for O
them O
, O
within O
the O
realm O
of O
possibilities O
. O

Children B-TER
up O
to O
age O
14 O
who O
lived O
with O
their O
parents O
went O
to O
the O
shelters O
every O
day O
, O
where O
they O
attended O
lessons O
in O
the O
most O
difficult O
circumstances O
thanks O
to O
the O
courage O
and O
devotion O
of O
the O
caretakers O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
’s O
strict O
orders O
against O
them O
. O

Young B-TER
people I-TER
over O
age O
14 O
who O
lived O
either O
with O
their O
parents O
or O
in O
homes B-TER
were O
forced B-TER
to I-TER
work I-TER
. O

To O
facilitate O
this O
, O
a O
special O
section O
for O
the O
integration O
of O
young B-TER
people I-TER
into O
the O
labor B-TER
process O
was O
created O
in O
close O
cooperation O
with O
the O
youth B-TER
section O
and O
labor B-ORG
office I-ORG
. O

In O
the O
summer O
of O
1943 O
, O
a O
total O
of O
1,673 O
children B-TER
were O
registered O
in O
this O
section O
. O

Young B-TER
people I-TER
were O
assigned O
the O
type O
of O
work O
that O
would O
allow O
them O
to O
learn O
something O
, O
for O
example O
in O
agriculture B-TER
and O
gardening O
, O
crafts O
and O
production O
, O
healthcare B-TER
and O
education B-TER
. O

These O
young B-TER
people I-TER
were O
also O
taken O
care O
of O
by O
a O
special O
apprenticeship O
commission O
that O
also O
administered O
exams O
once O
their O
training O
was O
completed O
. O

To O
help O
with O
all O
of O
these O
educational O
activities O
, O
a O
children B-TER
’s I-TER
library B-ORG
for O
children B-TER
up O
to O
age O
13 O
and O
a O
young B-TER
people I-TER
's I-TER
library B-ORG
for O
older O
children B-TER
were O
established O
. O

Besides O
the O
caretakers B-TER
’ O
ethical O
and O
practical O
goals O
, O
the O
youth B-ORG
section I-ORG
tried O
to O
expand O
the O
children B-TER
’s O
minds O
and O
thus O
stop O
the O
deepening O
moral O
decline O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
. O

By O
pointing O
to O
the O
Jewish O
nation O
’s O
illustrious O
past O
and O
the O
life O
and O
work O
of O
the O
future O
, O
the O
caretakers B-TER
tried O
to O
neutralize O
the O
dismalness O
and O
hopelessness O
of O
their O
situation O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
these O
efforts O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

Transports B-TER
continued O
to O
arrive O
and O
depart O
; O
orders O
and O
bullying O
gave O
the O
children B-TER
no O
peace O
. O

Around O
15,000 O
children B-TER
passed O
through O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

A O
transport B-TER
to I-TER
the I-TER
east I-TER
meant O
a O
death B-TER
sentence O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
protect O
children B-TER
younger O
than O
12 O
. O

But O
this O
age O
limit O
was O
gradually O
lowered O
, O
and O
in O
October O
1944 O
even O
babies B-TER
were O
transported O
. O

In O
the O
winter O
of O
1944 O
- O
1945 O
, O
1,068 O
children B-TER
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
and O
after O
the O
war O
no O
more O
than O
100 O
children B-TER
older O
than O
14 O
returned O
from O
the O
concentration B-TER
camps I-TER
. O

Unless O
they O
were O
among O
the O
fortunate O
who O
remained O
in O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
, O
no O
children B-TER
younger O
than O
14 O
returned O
. O

All O
of O
the O
efforts O
and O
work O
, O
all O
of O
the O
mental O
and O
physical O
care O
, O
all O
of O
the O
individual O
and O
collective O
education B-TER
led O
nowhere O
. O

They O
could O
only O
make O
the O
children B-TER
’s O
stay O
in O
the O
ghetto B-LOC
a O
little O
easier O
. O

They O
could O
n’t O
avert O
their O
terrible O
fate O
