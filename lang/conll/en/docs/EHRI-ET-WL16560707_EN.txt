Experiences O
and O
observations O
of O
Frau B-TER
Anita B-PER
Wallfisch I-PER
née O
Lasker B-PER
during O
the O
National B-TER
Socialist I-TER
regime O
Recorded O
by O
W. B-PER
Berent I-PER
My O
hometown O
is O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

There O
my O
father O
, O
Rechtsanwalt O
Lasker O
, O
had O
an O
extensive O
lawyer B-TER
’s I-TER
practice O
. O

When O
after O
having O
taken O
over O
the O
government B-TER
in O
Germany B-LOC
the O
National B-TER
Socialists I-TER
passed O
the O
Judengesetze O
my O
father O
was O
no O
longer O
allowed O
to O
pursue O
his O
profession O
in O
the O
way O
he O
had O
done O
. O

He O
was O
only O
allowed O
to O
work B-TER
as O
a O
law B-TER
consultant I-TER
without O
being O
called O
to O
the O
bar O
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
continue O
like O
this O
until O
1941 O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
in O
1939 O
, O
our O
flat B-TER
with O
all O
the O
furniture O
was O
confiscated B-TER
. O

My O
parents O
were O
forced O
to O
move O
together O
with O
me O
and O
my O
elder O
sister O
into O
the O
small O
flat B-TER
which O
belonged O
to O
an O
uncle O
and O
an O
aunt O
of O
mine O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
was O
still O
going O
to O
school B-TER
, O
but O
then O
took O
up O
the O
study O
of O
music B-TER
in O
order O
to O
become O
a O
cellist B-TER
. O

Because O
of O
the O
measures B-TER
which O
were O
taken O
against O
the O
Jewish B-TER
population I-TER
, O
especially O
the O
restricted B-TER
allocations O
of O
food B-TER
, O
life B-TER
became O
very O
hard O
for O
us O
. O

In O
the O
years O
1941 O
- O
1942 O
the O
deportations B-TER
of O
the O
Jews O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
started O
. O

The O
first O
of O
us O
to O
suffer O
this O
harsh O
lot O
were O
my O
uncle O
and O
my O
aunt O
who O
had O
shared O
their O
flat B-TER
with O
us O
. O

In O
1942 O
both O
my O
father O
and O
my O
mother O
were O
also O
fetched O
from O
our O
flat B-TER
and O
deported B-TER
. O

The O
only O
sign O
of O
life O
that O
we O
received O
from O
them O
was O
a O
postcard B-TER
, O
which O
my O
father O
had O
sent O
to O
us O
from O
the O
Isbiza B-LOC
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
near O
Lublin B-LOC
. O

Since O
then O
we O
have O
never O
heard O
anything O
from O
them O
. O

Sometime O
later O
my O
grandmother O
, O
who O
was O
more O
than O
80 O
years O
old O
, O
was O
also O
finally O
deported B-TER
. O

She O
is O
said O
to O
have O
been O
taken O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Thus O
only O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
were O
left O
in O
the O
flat B-TER
, O
alone O
. O

After O
a O
short O
time O
, O
this O
flat B-TER
was O
also O
confiscated B-TER
. O

Soon O
afterwards O
the O
two O
of O
us O
had O
to O
move O
into O
an O
orphanage B-TER
. O

Since O
about O
1941 O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
had O
been O
assigned O
to O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
. O

I O
was O
16 O
years O
old O
at O
that O
time O
. O

We O
had O
to O
work B-TER
in O
a O
paper O
factory B-TER
which O
was O
situated O
in O
a O
suburb O
far O
away O
from O
the O
City O
. O

Since O
Jews O
were O
forbidden B-TER
to I-TER
use I-TER
public I-TER
transport I-TER
we O
had O
to O
walk O
the O
whole O
long O
way O
. O

That O
meant O
that O
I O
had O
to O
leave O
home B-TER
as O
early O
as O
4 O
am O
when O
I O
was O
assigned O
for O
the O
early O
morning O
shift O
from O
6 O
am O
until O
2 O
pm O
. O

The O
second O
shift O
had O
to O
work B-TER
from O
2 O
pm O
until O
10 O
pm O
. O

The O
work B-TER
itself O
that O
we O
had O
to O
do O
was O
relatively O
clean O
and O
not O
too O
hard O
though O
the O
quota O
of O
work B-TER
that O
we O
had O
to O
achieve O
was O
gradually O
increased O
. O

But O
the O
pay O
I O
received O
was O
extremely O
small O
, O
about O
RM B-TER
7.00 O
per O
week O
. O

The O
money B-TER
was O
far O
from O
being O
sufficient O
for O
even O
the O
most O
essential O
necessities O
of O
life O
. O

I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
any O
clothes B-TER
whatsoever O
. O

This O
problem O
, O
together O
with O
the O
small O
rations B-TER
of I-TER
food I-TER
that O
we O
Jews O
were O
allotted O
, O
made O
life O
almost O
unbearable O
. O

Besides O
Jews O
, O
Polish B-LOC
civilian B-TER
workers B-TER
, O
deported B-TER
French B-LOC
civilians B-TER
and O
French B-LOC
soldiers B-TER
who O
were O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
also O
worked B-TER
in O
this O
factory B-TER
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
speak O
French B-LOC
fluently O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
strictly O
forbidden O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
we O
soon O
made O
contact O
with O
them O
. O

The O
foreign O
forced B-TER
labour I-TER
convicts O
and O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
were O
put O
up O
in O
barracks B-TER
. O

Many O
of O
the O
latter O
were O
planning O
to O
escape B-TER
. O

But O
they O
could O
not O
realise O
their O
intentions O
, O
because O
with O
the O
uniforms B-TER
they O
were O
wearing O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
them O
to O
contact O
people B-TER
in O
the O
town O
whose O
help B-TER
they O
could O
count O
on O
. O

My O
sister O
and O
I O
then O
decided O
to O
organise O
contacts O
with O
these O
people B-TER
who O
were O
ready O
to O
help B-TER
. O

To O
begin O
with O
we O
succeeded O
in O
providing O
civilian B-TER
clothes B-TER
for O
a O
number O
of O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
. O

Then O
we O
also O
helped B-TER
them O
to O
get O
false B-TER
documents I-TER
. O

To O
achieve O
this O
, O
we O
used O
the O
fact O
that O
foreign O
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
, O
including O
the O
French B-LOC
, O
among O
them O
men B-TER
and O
also O
women B-TER
, O
were O
from O
time O
to O
time O
granted O
a O
short O
holiday B-TER
at O
home O
. O

All O
we O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
disguise O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
as O
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
on O
holiday B-TER
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
we O
obtained O
, O
from O
prisoners B-TER
who O
worked B-TER
in O
printing O
shops O
, O
the O
relevant O
forms O
, O
which O
we O
filled O
in O
ourselves O
in O
Gothic O
script O
for O
the O
individual O
people B-TER
. O

In O
this O
way O
a O
major O
number O
of O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
succeeded O
in O
fleeing B-TER
to O
that O
part O
of O
France B-LOC
which O
at O
that O
time O
was O
not O
yet O
occupied B-TER
. O

Finally O
, O
all O
the O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
and O
their O
helpers B-TER
everywhere O
in O
the O
town O
had O
known O
how O
valuable O
our O
help B-TER
had O
been O
for O
many O
prisoners B-TER
. O

In O
September O
1942 O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
decided O
to O
flee B-TER
to O
France B-LOC
ourselves O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
we O
had O
helped B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
to O
escape B-TER
. O

We O
had O
been O
informed O
about O
authorities O
in O
France B-LOC
who O
would O
help B-TER
us O
there O
. O

So O
we O
filled O
in O
forms O
for O
holidays B-TER
for O
ourselves O
as O
alleged O
French B-LOC
forced B-TER
labourers I-TER
and O
one O
day O
we O
went O
to O
the O
station O
with O
friends O
and O
some O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
with O
the O
same O
holiday B-TER
documents O
to O
set O
off O
on O
our O
journey O
. O

We O
were O
already O
sitting O
in O
the O
train B-TER
for O
Paris B-LOC
when O
- O
Gestapo B-ORG
officials B-TER
arrived O
and O
arrested B-TER
us O
as O
well O
as O
the O
fleeing B-TER
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
, O
and O
also O
our O
friends O
who O
had O
accompanied O
us O
to O
the O
station O
. O

Later O
I O
learnt O
that O
at O
that O
time O
there O
were O
already O
rumours O
in O
the O
town O
that O
we O
had O
successfully O
escaped B-TER
from O
Germany B-LOC
and O
that O
in O
one O
church B-TER
a O
special O
prayer B-TER
had O
been O
said O
for O
us O
. O

Obviously O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
who O
had O
suspected O
us O
for O
a O
long O
time O
because O
we O
knew O
the O
French B-LOC
language O
so O
well O
, O
had O
observed O
us O
closely O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

For O
at O
the O
same O
time O
our O
helpers B-TER
, O
whom O
we O
had O
in O
the O
town O
, O
were O
arrested B-TER
. O

With O
some O
of O
these O
, O
who O
were O
also O
Jews O
, O
we O
were O
put O
together O
into O
the O
prison B-TER
cell O
which O
was O
reserved O
for O
Jews O
. O

That O
was O
very O
useful O
for O
us O
because O
thus O
we O
were O
able O
to O
discuss O
how O
we O
could O
defend O
ourselves O
. O

There O
was O
a O
rule O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
had O
to O
decide O
within O
21 O
days O
whether O
arrested B-TER
people B-TER
were O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
court B-TER
or O
to O
be O
sent O
immediately O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

We O
breathed O
a O
sigh O
of O
relief O
when O
we O
learnt O
that O
legal B-TER
proceedings I-TER
would O
be O
taken O
against O
us O
at O
the O
Volksgerichtshof O
and O
hoped O
to O
receive O
a O
really O
long O
time O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

We O
knew O
that O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
always O
held O
arrested B-TER
Jews O
in O
their O
clutches O
. O

Even O
after O
a O
verdict O
of O
not O
guilty O
a O
Jew O
could O
not O
expect O
to O
be O
released B-TER
but O
was O
invariably O
taken O
into O
a O
camp B-TER
by O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

The O
same O
of O
course O
happened O
after O
you O
had O
served O
your O
time O
in O
prison B-TER
. O

It O
took O
about O
a O
year O
until O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
were O
brought O
to O
trial B-TER
. O

During O
that O
time O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
tried O
several O
times O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
us O
in O
order O
to O
take O
us O
to O
a O
concentration B-TER
camp I-TER
. O

But O
each O
time O
this O
was O
prevented O
by O
the O
judicial B-TER
authorities I-TER
. O

The O
trial B-TER
that O
then O
took O
place O
was O
rather O
farcical O
. O

We O
had O
no O
barrister O
and O
had O
to O
defend O
ourselves O
. O

My O
sister O
said O
she O
was O
mainly O
responsible O
for O
the O
actions O
and O
for O
this O
was O
sentenced O
to O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
in O
gaol B-TER
. O

I O
was O
sentenced O
to O
18 O
months O
in O
prison B-TER
for O
forging B-TER
documents I-TER
, O
helping B-TER
the O
enemy O
, O
trying O
to O
flee B-TER
and O
using O
false B-TER
documents I-TER
. O

My O
sister O
served O
her O
term O
in O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
gaol B-TER
in O
Jauer B-LOC
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
in O
Breslau B-LOC
to O
serve O
my O
sentence O
. O

The O
Breslau B-LOC
prison B-TER
was O
mainly O
used O
for O
temporarily O
putting O
up O
prisoners B-TER
who O
were O
transported B-TER
from O
there O
to O
other O
prisons B-TER
or O
into O
camps B-TER
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
food B-TER
in O
the O
prison B-TER
was O
far O
worse O
than O
in O
other O
similar O
institutions O
. O

This O
caused O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
suffering O
. O

It O
was O
also O
rather O
unpleasant O
that O
the O
cell B-TER
which O
I O
had O
to O
share O
with O
three O
other O
inmates B-TER
was O
swarming O
with O
bugs B-TER
, O
lice B-TER
and O
fleas B-TER
. O

It O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
get O
used O
to O
this O
situation O
. O

The O
treatment O
I O
experienced O
was O
routine O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
in O
particular O
to O
complain O
about O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
quite O
a O
few O
of O
the O
prison B-TER
warders B-TER
, O
some O
of O
whom O
were O
recruited O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
civilians B-TER
, O
behaved O
towards O
me O
very O
decently O
, O
perhaps O
because O
they O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
the O
daughter B-TER
of O
Herr O
Lasker O
, O
the O
lawyer B-TER
. O

During O
my O
imprisonment B-TER
I O
was O
allotted O
all O
sorts O
of O
work B-TER
, O
which O
I O
did O
welcome O
because O
the O
time O
thus O
passed O
more O
quickly O
. O

There O
was O
one O
incident O
which O
was O
typical O
of O
the O
pedantic O
way O
the O
German B-LOC
authorities B-TER
proceeded O
. O

I O
had O
wanted O
to O
take O
four O
suitcases O
with O
me O
on O
the O
journey O
to O
France B-LOC
. O

When O
I O
was O
arrested B-TER
only O
three O
suitcases O
– O
as O
I O
realised O
later O
– O
had O
been O
taken O
to O
the O
prison B-TER
, O
along O
with O
me O
. O

When O
it O
became O
known O
that O
one O
of O
my O
suitcases O
was O
missing O
they O
moved O
heaven O
and O
earth O
in O
order O
to O
find O
the O
suitcase O
. O

But O
at O
first O
all O
the O
searches O
were O
in O
vain O
. O

After O
a O
long O
time O
, O
they O
informed O
me O
, O
beaming O
with O
joy O
, O
that O
the O
suitcase O
had O
been O
found O
in O
Paris B-LOC
and O
had O
been O
transported O
back O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
for O
myself O
that O
this O
suitcase O
had O
not O
been O
broken O
open O
. O

That O
did O
not O
mean O
, O
however O
, O
that O
I O
got O
it O
back O
. O

When O
I O
was O
released B-TER
from O
prison B-TER
and O
handed O
over O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
I O
did O
not O
see O
anything O
at O
all O
of O
my O
luggage O
again O
. O

I O
was O
released B-TER
from O
prison B-TER
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
Auschwitz B-LOC
- I-LOC
Birkenau I-LOC
camp I-LOC
in O
December O
1943 O
. O

We O
had O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
Auschwitz B-LOC
and O
there O
were O
also O
talks O
about O
the O
gassing B-TER
there O
but O
we O
could O
not O
really O
imagine O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

All O
we O
knew O
was O
that O
being O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
was O
the O
worst O
that O
could O
happen O
to O
you O
. O

So O
I O
also O
believed O
that O
this O
would O
be O
my O
last O
journey O
. O

When O
before O
the O
transport B-TER
I O
was O
first O
taken O
by O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
to O
the O
medical B-TER
examination I-TER
I O
asked O
the O
doctor B-TER
why O
he O
was O
taking O
all O
that O
unnecessary O
trouble O
. O

The O
doctor B-TER
tried O
to O
calm O
me O
, O
saying O
it O
would O
not O
be O
all O
that O
bad O
. O

After O
the O
examination B-TER
I O
was O
taken O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
together O
with O
some O
other O
so O
- O
called O
Karteihäftlingen O
. O

Only O
later O
did O
I O
learn O
that O
Karteihäftlingen O
were O
those O
who O
had O
previously O
been O
sentenced O
to O
imprisonment B-TER
by O
a O
law B-TER
- I-TER
court I-TER
. O

Being O
one O
of O
them O
meant O
that O
you O
were O
safe O
from O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
because O
there O
might O
perhaps O
be O
a O
retrial O
of O
your O
case O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
night O
in O
Birkenau B-LOC
, O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
belonging O
to O
Auschwitz B-LOC
, O
and O
were O
received O
there O
by O
SS B-TER
- O
women B-TER
in O
black O
capes B-TER
. O

We O
spent O
the O
night O
in O
a O
barracks B-TER
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
were O
led O
into O
a O
room O
where O
we O
were O
tattooed O
and O
shaved O
and O
were O
due O
later O
to O
get O
new O
clothes B-TER
. O

While O
I O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
stark O
naked O
and O
with O
only O
a O
toothbrush B-TER
in O
my O
hand O
, O
one O
of O
the O
wardens B-TER
approached O
me O
and O
asked O
me O
about O
my O
job B-TER
. O

I O
was O
astonished O
to O
see O
that O
my O
answer O
, O
namely O
that O
I O
was O
a O
cellist B-TER
, O
caused O
great O
excitement O
. O

I O
was O
taken O
to O
one O
side O
and O
had O
to O
wait O
there O
until O
they O
had O
finished O
with O
the O
others O
. O

I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
they O
intended O
to O
do O
with O
me O
. O

But O
then O
I O
heard O
that O
I O
was O
regarded O
as O
an O
extremely O
valuable O
find O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
had O
an O
orchestra B-TER
, O
which O
was O
conducted O
by O
the O
well O
- O
known O
musician B-TER
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
. O

The O
commandant B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
, O
Höss B-PER
, O
was O
musical B-TER
and O
set O
great O
store O
by O
the O
achievements O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

But O
up O
to O
then O
it O
had O
consisted O
only O
of O
female B-TER
violinists B-TER
and O
mandolinists B-TER
. O

Incorporating O
a O
cellist B-TER
therefore O
seemed O
to O
be O
extremely O
valuable O
. O

Actually O
newcomers O
had O
to O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
the O
quarantine O
block O
. O

But O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
that O
block O
were O
so O
unhygienic B-TER
that O
many O
of O
the O
newcomers O
were O
said O
to O
have O
died B-TER
there O
already O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
there O
too O
at O
first O
but O
they O
promised O
to O
get O
me O
out O
again O
on O
the O
following O
day O
so O
that O
I O
could O
start O
playing O
with O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

And O
indeed O
the O
next O
morning O
the O
commandant B-TER
of O
the O
camp B-TER
brought O
me O
into O
the O
orchestra B-TER
barracks B-TER
, O
gave O
me O
a O
cello B-TER
with O
three O
strings O
and O
told O
me O
to O
play O
something O
for O
him O
. O

I O
had O
not O
played O
for O
years O
and O
therefore O
was O
completely O
out O
of O
practice O
. O

But O
the O
audience O
was O
satisfied O
and O
I O
immediately O
became O
a O
member O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

The O
conductor B-TER
, O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
, O
who O
herself O
was O
a O
violinist B-TER
, O
knew O
a O
lot O
about O
music B-TER
. O

Being O
very O
ambitious O
and O
energetic O
she O
succeeded O
in O
making O
the O
orchestra B-TER
perform O
at O
a O
high O
level O
. O

She O
very O
often O
rehearsed O
with O
us O
, O
set O
high O
standards O
to O
each O
of O
us O
individually O
, O
and O
was O
furious O
at O
every O
single O
wrong O
note B-TER
that O
was O
played O
. O

Our O
rehearsals O
lasted O
the O
whole O
day O
if O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
give O
a O
concert B-TER
, O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
that O
we O
were O
free O
from O
any O
other O
work B-TER
. O

Our O
programme O
consisted O
only O
of O
very O
light O
music B-TER
, O
marches B-TER
, O
waltzes B-TER
, O
folk B-TER
songs I-TER
, O
in O
particular O
those O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
the O
like O
. O

We O
also O
had O
to O
accompany O
singers B-TER
who O
had O
to O
present O
their O
skills O
. O

The O
orchestra B-TER
was O
active O
every O
morning O
, O
when O
the O
columns O
of O
workers B-TER
left O
for O
work B-TER
and O
in O
the O
evenings O
, O
when O
they O
returned O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Moreover O
we O
had O
to O
play B-TER
on O
Sundays O
for O
the O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
or O
also O
for O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
who O
were O
the O
camp B-TER
guards I-TER
. O

When O
in O
1944 O
thousands O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
were O
brought O
into O
the O
camp B-TER
and O
were O
lining O
up O
in O
order O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
we O
also O
had O
to O
play O
something O
for O
these O
ill O
- O
fated O
people B-TER
. O

Incidentally O
, O
we O
members O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
had O
a O
very O
special O
position O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

We O
owed O
this O
mainly O
to O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
, O
who O
was O
very O
good O
- O
looking O
and O
elegant O
, O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
indispensable O
in O
her O
position O
and O
knew O
very O
well O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
. O

Thanks O
to O
her O
influence O
we O
had O
all O
sorts O
of O
privileges O
. O

It O
is O
true O
we O
had O
to O
come O
to O
the O
general O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
every O
day O
, O
but O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
remain O
standing O
often O
for O
five O
hours O
. O

The O
food B-TER
that O
we O
received O
did O
not O
vary O
but O
sometimes O
we O
got O
more O
than O
the O
others O
. O

The O
rules O
for O
clothing B-TER
which O
were O
obligatory O
for O
the O
internees B-TER
did O
not O
apply O
to O
us O
so O
strictly O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
for O
our O
normal O
orchestral B-TER
performances O
they O
had O
white O
jackets B-TER
made O
to O
measure O
for O
us O
. O

Wearing B-TER
these O
we O
had O
to O
parade O
as O
a O
kind O
of O
show O
whenever O
the O
good O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
to O
be O
demonstrated O
to O
high O
- O
ranking O
SS B-TER
leaders B-TER
or O
other O
personages O
. O

Only O
in O
our O
block O
did O
Christians B-TER
and O
Jews O
live O
together O
. O

This O
caused O
all O
kinds O
of O
animosities O
as O
especially O
the O
Polish B-LOC
Christian B-TER
women B-TER
among O
us O
showed O
ineradicable O
hatred O
for O
the O
German B-LOC
Jews O
in O
particular O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
the O
important O
jobs B-TER
in O
the O
orchestra B-TER
were O
occupied O
by O
Jews O
added O
fuel O
to O
this O
hatred O
. O

Moreover O
, O
we O
were O
the O
only O
ones O
who O
actually O
got O
the O
parcels B-TER
which O
were O
occasionally O
sent O
by O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

Usually O
the O
SS B-TER
kept O
these O
parcels B-TER
for O
themselves O
. O

In O
the O
camp B-TER
self O
- O
government O
by O
the O
internees B-TER
had O
been O
introduced O
to O
a O
considerable O
degree O
. O

Each O
barracks B-TER
was O
subject O
to O
a O
block O
senior O
and O
each O
group O
of O
workers B-TER
to O
a O
Kapo B-TER
. O

These O
were O
appointed O
by O
the O
camp B-TER
management I-TER
and O
were O
responsible O
to O
them O
for O
all O
occurrences O
with O
those O
under O
their O
control O
. O

Those O
who O
got O
these O
jobs B-TER
were O
far O
from O
being O
the O
most O
positive O
elements O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
often O
suffered O
much O
more O
from O
the O
treatment O
of O
those O
than O
from O
the O
SS B-TER
. O

Thefts O
, O
blackmail O
, O
maltreatment O
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
generally O
. O

Whoever O
had O
been O
clever O
enough O
to O
secure O
a O
job B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen B-TER
or O
in O
a O
depot O
had O
a O
good O
life O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
general O
conditions B-TER
there O
. O

They O
used O
the O
stock O
that O
was O
entrusted O
to O
them O
for O
extensive O
bartering B-TER
. O

Objects O
for O
exchange B-TER
were O
above O
all O
food B-TER
, O
clothing B-TER
and O
cigarettes O
. O

Bartering B-TER
also O
flourished O
among O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
. O

I O
have O
often O
exchanged B-TER
a O
piece O
of O
bread B-TER
for O
some O
cigarettes O
. O

People B-TER
discovered O
while O
they O
were O
trading B-TER
were O
subject O
to O
punishment B-TER
. O

Sometimes O
this O
punishment B-TER
involved O
having O
to O
eat B-TER
these O
dozen O
cigarettes O
you O
had O
just O
bought O
. O

Meanwhile O
my O
sister O
had O
also O
been O
transferred B-TER
from O
gaol B-TER
to O
Birkenau B-LOC
. O

She O
was O
not O
so O
lucky O
as O
I O
was O
and O
was O
put O
up O
in O
one O
of O
the O
ordinary O
barracks B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Here O
she O
had O
to O
work B-TER
very O
hard O
every O
day O
with O
the O
other O
inmates B-TER
, O
which O
among O
other O
things O
meant O
she O
had O
to O
transport O
very O
heavy O
stones O
. O

The O
hard O
work B-TER
together O
with O
insufficient O
food B-TER
and O
the O
unhygienic B-TER
conditions I-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
contributed O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
were O
many O
diseases B-TER
among O
the O
women B-TER
, O
which O
often O
became O
real O
epidemics B-TER
. O

It O
was O
especially O
scabies B-TER
and O
typhus B-TER
that O
spread O
widely O
. O

It O
often O
happened O
that O
the O
patients O
had O
to O
parade O
in O
front O
of O
a O
group O
of O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
. O

Whoever O
no O
longer O
seemed O
to O
be O
strong O
enough O
was O
inevitably O
sent O
into O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

I O
and O
also O
my O
sister O
caught O
typhus B-TER
. O

When O
I O
was O
lying O
there O
almost O
unconscious O
a O
patients O
’ O
parade O
was O
taking O
place O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
SS B-TER
leader B-TER
Höss B-PER
was O
present O
who O
recognised O
me O
as O
the O
cellist B-TER
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
and O
gave O
the O
order B-TER
to O
leave O
me O
lying O
there O
. O

On O
the O
same O
occasion O
my O
sister O
had O
the O
presence O
of O
mind O
to O
explain O
that O
she O
was O
the O
cellist B-TER
’s I-TER
sister O
. O

That O
also O
saved O
her O
from O
the O
gas B-TER
chamber I-TER
. O

Sometime O
later O
Alma B-PER
Rosé I-PER
died B-TER
mysteriously O
. O

Meningitis B-TER
was O
declared O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
death B-TER
. O

But O
many O
thought O
the O
reason O
was O
poisoning O
. O

A O
Russian B-LOC
woman B-TER
now O
became O
the O
conductor B-TER
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
who O
however O
did O
not O
know O
anything O
about O
music B-TER
. O

Not O
long O
after O
, O
in O
December O
1944 O
, O
the O
orchestra B-TER
was O
dissolved O
and O
we O
were O
transported B-TER
to O
Belsen B-LOC
. O

I O
later O
learnt O
that O
the O
primitive O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
to O
be O
concealed O
from O
the O
Allies B-TER
whose O
troops B-TER
were O
progressing O
rapidly O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
Germans B-LOC
intended O
to O
demolish O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
where O
there O
were O
only O
( O
wooden O
) O
barracks B-TER
, O
which O
also O
included O
the O
women B-TER
’s I-TER
camp I-TER
, O
and O
to O
leave O
intact O
only O
the O
area O
in O
Auschwitz B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
stone O
buildings O
. O

Incidentally O
, O
they O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
pulling O
down O
the O
crematorium B-TER
, O
which O
was O
also O
supposed O
to O
disappear O
completely O
– O
it O
had O
been O
built O
too O
solidly O
. O

The O
first O
sign O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
change O
for O
us O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
our O
orchestra B-TER
barracks B-TER
the O
Jews O
were O
separated O
from O
the O
Christians B-TER
. O

When O
we O
then O
received O
new O
clothes B-TER
we O
got O
the O
worst O
things O
. O

This O
was O
done O
because O
we O
as O
members O
of O
the O
group O
that O
had O
been O
privileged O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
so O
far O
had O
thus O
provoked O
the O
hatred O
and O
the O
jealousy O
of O
all O
the O
other O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
. O

Then O
we O
were O
checked O
by O
a O
doctor B-TER
and O
finally O
loaded O
into O
cattle B-TER
wagons I-TER
for O
Belsen B-LOC
. O

The O
Belsen B-LOC
camp I-LOC
was O
extremely O
primitive O
. O

There O
were O
only O
large O
tents B-TER
with O
room O
for O
about O
1,000 O
persons B-TER
and O
they O
were O
completely O
occupied O
. O

There O
were O
no O
lights O
nor O
any O
other O
comforts O
. O

We O
were O
forced O
into O
that O
room O
together O
with O
a O
further O
3,000 O
newcomers O
. O

The O
tents B-TER
were O
overcrowded O
to O
an O
incredible O
degree O
. O

If O
you O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet B-TER
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
force O
your O
way O
through O
the O
masses O
of O
people B-TER
to O
the O
tent B-TER
exit O
. O

After O
some O
days O
a O
whirlwind O
helped O
us O
, O
which O
tore O
down O
all O
the O
tents B-TER
and O
dropped O
them O
onto O
our O
heads O
. O

When O
the O
panic O
which O
had O
been O
caused O
by O
this O
event O
had O
calmed O
down O
we O
were O
standing O
throughout O
the O
night O
in O
the O
open O
air O
while O
the O
rain O
was O
pouring O
down O
. O

Then O
we O
were O
temporarily O
put O
up O
in O
SS B-TER
storerooms O
where O
we O
spent O
some O
time O
without O
any O
food B-TER
at O
all O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
were O
put O
up O
in O
barracks B-TER
where O
Russian B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
had O
been O
before O
. O

I O
think O
we O
were O
right O
in O
supposing O
that O
these O
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
had O
simply O
been O
shot B-TER
to O
make O
room O
for O
us O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
. O

Here O
we O
had O
at O
least O
electric O
light O
and O
occasionally O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
weaver O
’s O
shop O
to O
work B-TER
there O
. O

But O
there O
was O
extremely O
little O
food B-TER
and O
the O
diseases B-TER
among O
us O
, O
especially O
typhus B-TER
and O
jaundice B-TER
, O
increased O
. O

But O
there O
were O
not O
yet O
so O
many O
cases O
of O
death B-TER
at O
that O
time O
. O

From O
my O
sister O
, O
who O
had O
also O
come O
to O
Belsen B-LOC
and O
worked B-TER
as O
secretary O
in O
the O
SS B-TER
quarters O
, O
we O
received O
constant O
reports O
about O
the O
latest O
news O
of O
the O
day O
which O
in O
her O
position O
she O
was O
able O
to O
get O
. O

The O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
were O
soon O
absolutely O
unbearable O
. O

Again O
and O
again O
new O
transports B-TER
arrived O
from O
the O
East O
, O
also O
with O
people B-TER
who O
had O
had O
to O
walk O
hundreds O
of O
miles O
and O
now O
were O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
keep O
on O
their O
feet O
. O

All O
these O
people B-TER
were O
crammed O
into O
the O
barracks B-TER
and O
it O
ended O
like O
this O
, O
namely O
people B-TER
were O
literally O
lying O
on O
each O
other O
and O
you O
had O
no O
chance O
at O
all O
to O
move O
. O

Then O
the O
food B-TER
was O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
more O
and O
more O
irregular O
. O

Then O
people B-TER
died B-TER
by O
the O
hundreds O
of O
malnutrition B-TER
. O

Only O
the O
strongest O
survived B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
I O
saw O
cases O
of O
cannibalism O
also O
among O
the O
men O
. O

As O
a O
punishment O
one O
man B-TER
had O
to O
kneel O
for O
many O
hours O
, O
with O
a O
human O
ear O
in O
his O
mouth O
. O

I O
owe O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
held O
out O
to O
the O
end O
only O
to O
the O
circumstance O
that O
I O
had O
joined O
up O
with O
ten O
other O
women B-TER
who O
were O
former O
members O
of O
the O
orchestra B-TER
. O

We O
had O
developed O
a O
certain O
routine O
, O
had O
a O
thorough O
wash B-TER
every O
day O
, O
helped O
each O
other O
with O
everything O
and O
encouraged O
each O
other O
. O

Soon O
there O
were O
more O
and O
more O
signs O
that O
we O
would O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
much O
longer O
for O
our O
liberation B-TER
. O

Again O
and O
again O
low O
- O
flying O
aircraft B-TER
of O
the O
Allies B-TER
flew O
over O
our O
camp B-TER
, O
dropping O
their O
bombs B-TER
very O
precisely O
only O
onto O
the O
SS B-TER
barracks B-TER
. O

For O
some O
days O
also O
the O
SS B-TER
sentry O
squads O
completely O
disappeared O
from O
the O
camp B-TER
but O
then O
came O
back O
again O
. O

The O
sentry O
squad O
consisted O
mainly O
of O
Hungarian B-LOC
SS B-TER
men I-TER
who O
treated O
us O
especially O
fanatically O
. O

I O
learnt O
afterwards O
that O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
promised O
the O
SS B-TER
people B-TER
to O
send O
them O
back O
to O
the O
German B-LOC
lines O
if O
they O
handed O
the O
camp B-TER
over O
intact O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
no O
idea O
how O
unbelievably O
dreadful O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
our O
camp B-TER
were O
. O

A O
few O
days O
before O
our O
liberation B-TER
the O
camp B-TER
inmates I-TER
had O
not O
received O
their O
bread B-TER
rations I-TER
because O
of O
some O
incident O
. O

After O
that O
, O
during O
the O
very O
last O
days O
, O
there O
was O
no O
food B-TER
at O
all O
. O

We O
survivors B-TER
had O
wasted O
away O
to O
skin O
and O
bone O
and O
were O
so O
weak O
that O
we O
were O
hardly O
able O
to O
move O
. O

Around O
us O
the O
numbers O
of O
dead B-TER
kept O
growing O
. O

That O
was O
the O
picture O
that O
presented O
itself O
to O
the O
English B-LOC
troops B-TER
when O
at O
last O
they O
occupied O
the O
camp B-TER
on O
15 O
April O
1945 O
. O

The O
sentry O
squad O
had O
waited O
calmly O
for O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
English B-LOC
, O
obviously O
relying O
on O
the O
promise O
that O
nothing O
would O
happen O
to O
them O
. O

Also O
the O
camp B-TER
commandant B-TER
Kramer B-PER
was O
still O
there O
. O

I O
saw O
him O
sitting O
calmly O
and O
peacefully O
on O
an O
English B-LOC
tank O
and O
guiding O
the O
English B-LOC
officers B-TER
through O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Of O
course O
, O
after O
the O
English B-LOC
had O
discovered O
the O
conditions B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
the O
promise O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
valid O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
men I-TER
were O
immediately O
called O
to O
fetch O
the O
thousands O
of O
corpses B-TER
from O
the O
barracks B-TER
and O
bury B-TER
them O
. O

We O
survivors B-TER
were O
taken O
good O
care O
of O
by O
the O
English B-LOC
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
our O
ordeal O
. O

Later O
my O
sister O
and O
I O
were O
awarded O
a O
medal B-TER
by O
the O
French B-LOC
government B-TER
for O
having O
helped B-TER
the O
French B-LOC
prisoners B-TER
of I-TER
war I-TER
. O

Correction O

: O
Jews O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
use O
the O
tram O
. O

We O
could O
travel O
only O
by O
train B-TER
to O
the O
factory B-TER
where O
we O
worked B-TER
, O
so O
we O
had O
to O
walk O
to O
the O
station O
and O
were O
allowed O
to O
go O
by O
train B-TER
but O
not O
to O
sit O
down O
