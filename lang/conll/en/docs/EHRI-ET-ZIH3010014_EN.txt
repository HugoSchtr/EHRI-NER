After O
the O
war B-TER
broke O
out O
in O
1939 O
, O
I O
left O
for O
Kurów B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Puławy B-LOC
district O
. O

After O
Kurów B-LOC
was O
bombed B-TER
, O
I O
moved O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Wólka B-LOC
Kątna I-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Markuszów B-LOC
municipality O
, O
where O
I O
lived O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
four O
children B-TER
until O
April O
1942 O
. O

From O
there O
, O
we O
were O
resettled B-TER
in O
Opole B-LOC
. O

Opole O
Lubelskie O
We O
settled O
in O
the O
ghetto B-TER
there O
, O
whose O
liquidation B-TER
began O
five O
weeks O
after O
we O
arrived O
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
1942 O
, O
several O
transports B-TER
of O
Jews O
left O
Opole B-LOC
for O
an O
unknown O
destination O
, O
and O
we O
never O
heard O
from O
them O
again O
. O

In O
early O
May O
, O
Geda B-PER
, O
a O
clerk O
from O
the O
district O
office O
, O
came O
and O
ordered O
them O
to O
move O
to O
barracks B-TER
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
punishing B-TER
the I-TER
Jews I-TER
for O
their O
filth O
and O
disorder O
. O

Then O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
surrounded O
those O
barracks B-TER
, O
guarded O
them O
for O
two O
days O
, O
and O
then O
the O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
taken O
away O
by O
cart B-TER
to O
the O
station O
in O
Nałęczów B-LOC
, O
while O
the O
men B-TER
were O
ordered O
to O
march O
there O
on O
foot O
. O

During O
the O
march O
, O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
asked O
the O
men O
, O
who O
wants O
to O
ride O
in O
the O
cart O
, O
and O
then O
they O
killed B-TER
anyone O
who O
volunteered O
. O

About O
50 O
people O
were O
killed B-TER
this O
way O
. O

People O
were O
also O
robbed B-TER
during O
the O
march O
. O

In O
Nałęczów B-LOC
, O
they O
kept O
everyone O
behind O
barbed O
wire O
for O
48 O
hours O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
was O
raining O
, O
if O
someone O
wanted O
to O
drink O
some O
of O
the O
water O
running O
from O
the O
drainpipe O
, O
he O
had O
to O
buy O
it O
with O
a O
ring O
, O
an O
earring O
, O
or O
an O
appropriate O
sum O
of O
money O
. O

Many O
people O
died B-TER
of O
hunger B-TER
and O
exhaustion O
then O
. O

When O
women B-TER
and O
children B-TER
were O
getting O
off O
the O
carts O
, O
the O
SD B-ORG
-men O
guarding O
them O
beat O
those O
misfortunate O
people O
with O
riding O
crops O
until O
they O
bled O
. O

Then O
everyone O
was O
taken O
to O
Sobibór B-LOC
. O

Many O
people O
suffocated O
during O
the O
journey B-TER
because O
the O
wagons B-TER
were O
so O
overcrowded O
. O

The O
train B-TER
entered O
the O
camp B-TER
proper O
, O
which O
occupied O
an O
enormous O
area O
, O
and O
was O
surrounded O
by O
barbed O
wire O
four O
layers O
thick O
, O
and O
also O
by O
a O
deep O
ditch O
filled O
with O
water O
, O
and O
then O
even O
farther O
outside O
, O
the O
field O
adjacent O
to O
the O
ditch O
was O
mined O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
was O
divided O
into O
three O
parts O
. O

The O
first O
and O
second O
were O
allowed O
to O
have O
contact O
with O
one O
another O
; O
the O
third O
was O
separate O
, O
located O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
it O
was O
forbidden O
to O
enter O
that O
area O
. O

Everyone O
who O
was O
in O
this O
camp B-TER
was O
liquidated B-TER
. O

As O
many O
men B-TER
, O
women B-TER
, O
and O
children B-TER
as O
the O
gas B-TER
chambers I-TER
could O
hold O
were O
herded O
into O
the O
third O
camp B-TER
. O

The O
unlucky O
were O
taken O
to O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

2 O
, O
where O
SS B-TER
read O
out O
the O
following O
statement O
: O
This O
is O
the O
transit O
camp O
, O
from O
here O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
work O
in O
Ukraine O
. O

They O
must O
go O
to O
the O
baths O
now O
, O
after O
which O
they O
will O
receive O
clean O
underwear O
and O
will O
continue O
on O
their O
way O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
, O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
were O
told O
to O
undress O
separately O
, O
but O
then O
the O
Germans B-TER
stopped O
trying O
to O
keep O
up O
appearances O
, O
and O
women B-TER
and O
men B-TER
undressed O
in O
the O
same O
room O
. O

In O
the O
next O
part O
of O
the O
speech O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
advised O
that O
each O
person O
should O
remember O
where O
he O
put O
his O
clothes B-TER
, O
so O
they O
would O
not O
get O
lost O
, O
and O
they O
advised O
people O
to O
put O
their O
money B-TER
and I-TER
valuables I-TER
in O
the O
deposit O
desk O
, O
for O
which O
they O
received O
a O
receipt O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
in O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

1 O
, O
those O
waiting O
were O
witness O
to O
a O
selection B-TER
, O
at O
which O
skilled O
workers O
without O
families B-TER
were O
sent O
off O
through O
the O
main O
gate O
to O
work B-TER
in O
Osowa B-LOC
and O
Sawin B-LOC
. O

300 O
skilled O
workers O
left O
this O
way O
, O
then O
after O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
they O
were O
brought O
back O
and O
killed B-TER
. O

That O
group O
was O
forced O
to O
send O
letters O
to O
various O
towns O
so O
that O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
would O
not O
realize O
what O
danger O
they O
were O
in O
– O
after O
having O
carried O
out O
this O
task O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
Sobibór B-LOC
, O
where O
they O
perished O
. O

The O
Ukrainians B-LOC
beat O
the O
people O
who O
were O
walking O
past O
, O
already O
naked O
, O
until O
they O
bled O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
2000 O
people O
in O
the O
Opole B-LOC
transport B-TER
on O
the O
first O
day O
, O
100 O
people O
remained O
in O
the O
yard O
, O
and O
75 O
were O
sent O
to O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
to O
remove B-TER
the I-TER
corpses I-TER
. O

Up O
until O
that O
time O
, O
in O
the O
camp B-TER
it O
had O
usually O
been O
the O
case O
that O
those O
who O
had O
been O
working O
, O
regardless O
of O
what O
kind O
of O
work B-TER
it O
had O
been O
, O
would O
[ O
be O
killed O
] O
as O
soon O
as O
a O
fresh O
transport B-TER
came O
, O
and O
they O
would O
be O
replaced O
with O
people O
from O
the O
newly O
arrived O
group O
. O

Because O
of O
fears O
of O
rebellion B-TER
, O
people O
who O
were O
quite O
weak O
were O
taken O
to O
work B-TER
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
because O
of O
organizational O
difficulties O
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
decided O
against O
constant O
changes O
and O
have O
permanent O
workers O
instead O
. O

This O
was O
how O
I O
was O
put O
to O
work O
as O
the O
permanent O
camp B-TER
cook O
; O
I O
took O
on O
my O
son B-TER
as O
an O
assistant O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
100 O
who O
arrived O
that O
first O
night O
gradually O
all O
were O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
next O
transport B-TER
came O
from O
Żółkiew B-LOC
Probably O
Żółkiewka O
and O
Izbica B-LOC
. O

70 O
people O
from O
that O
transport B-TER
were O
designated O
to O
work B-TER
in O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
, O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
. I-TER

The O
gate O
was O
permanently O
closed O
, O
and O
there O
were O
pine O
branches O
stuck O
in O
the O
barbed O
wire O
that O
surrounded O
[ O
the O
camp O
] O
, O
completely O
obscuring O
it O
from O
view O
. O

The O
same O
kinds O
of O
branches O
, O
stuck O
in O
[ O
the O
fence O
] O
this O
way O
, O
hid O
the O
entire O
camp B-TER
from O
sight O
as O
well O
. O

The O
workers O
who O
brought O
food B-TER
to O
the O
people O
working O
in O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
50 O
paces O
from O
the O
gate O
, O
and O
then O
walk O
away O
quickly O
. O

When O
transports B-TER
arrived O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TER
, O
since O
the O
food B-TER
that O
the O
Jews O
had O
brought O
with O
them O
was O
given O
to O
the O
kitchen O
. O

As O
the O
cook B-TER
, O
I O
lived O
with O
my O
son B-TER
in O
a O
separate O
building B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
to O
that O
kitchen B-TER
, O
there O
were O
2 O
others O
for O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
and O
the O
German B-TER
officers O
. O

Several O
dozen O
people O
were O
chosen O
from O
each O
of O
the O
following O
groups O
and O
a O
team B-TER
of I-TER
laborers I-TER
was O
formed O
, O
which O
for O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
reached O
a O
total O
of O
600 O
; O
for O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
, O
the O
total O
was O
450 O
. O

The O
conditions O
in O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
were O
extremely B-TER
harsh I-TER
, O
with O
beatings O
, O
dogs O
set O
on O
prisoners B-TER
, O
and O
50 O
lashes O
as O
punishment O
for O
badly O
done O
work B-TER
. O

The O
Jews O
were O
changed O
there O
very O
often O
, O
and O
, O
under O
the O
pretext O
that O
they O
were O
being O
sent O
to O
other O
camps B-TER
, O
the O
weak O
were O
taken O
to O
the O
forest O
and O
shot B-TER
. O

Every O
time O
such O
an O
execution B-TER
took O
place O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
inmates B-TER
of O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
were O
taken O
to O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

2 O
, O
singing O
as O
they O
went O
, O
so O
they O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

Within O
4 O
- O
5 O
weeks O
everything O
was O
organized O
. O

In O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
, O
the O
Jews O
were O
put O
to O
work B-TER
sorting I-TER
and I-TER
packing I-TER
the O
belongings O
of O
those O
who O
had O
been O
killed B-TER
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
skilled B-TER
workers I-TER
were O
always O
kept O
busy O
doing O
various O
jobs O
. O

They O
sang O
as O
they O
went O
to O
work B-TER
( O
those O
were O
the O
orders O
) O
, O
and O
if O
the O
work B-TER
was O
not O
done O
, O
people O
were O
beaten O
, O
or O
a O
dog O
was O
let O
loose O
on O
them O
. O

As O
people O
worked O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
amused O
themselves O
by O
beating O
the O
people O
who O
were O
working B-TER
until O
they O
bled O
, O
and O
when O
the O
blood O
was O
flowing O
, O
they O
poured O
vinegar O
on O
the O
wounds O
and O
kept O
beating O
them O
. O

Jewish O
foremen O
headed O
the O
groups O
of O
workers B-TER
. O

One O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
in O
particular O
named O
Paul B-PER
was O
especially O
sadistic O
, O
and O
would O
often O
make O
the O
misfortunate O
one O
he O
chose O
drink O
Franc O
- O
Brantwein O
, O
Frantzbrenntwein O
( O
German O
) O
– O
rubbing O
alcohol O
. O

after O
which O
the O
person O
was O
sick B-TER
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
and O
often O
died B-TER
with O
symptoms O
of O
having O
been O
poisoned O
. O

Jews O
were O
brought O
at O
that O
time O
from O
Austria B-LOC
, O
Germany B-TER
, O
the O
Czech B-LOC
lands I-LOC
, O
Poland B-LOC
, O
Holland B-LOC
, O
and O
France B-LOC
, O
and O
they O
were O
annihilated O
. O

When O
no O
transports B-TER
arrived O
and O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
food B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
the O
Ukrainians B-LOC
would O
beat O
people O
brutally O
when O
workers B-TER
would O
find O
pieces O
of O
moldy O
bread B-TER
in O
the O
packages O
and O
eat O
it O
. O

Three O
months O
after O
we O
arrived O
, O
the O
killing B-TER
stopped O
, O
the O
officers O
were O
granted O
leaves O
for O
their O
ardent O
activities O
, O
and O
the O
oven O
began O
to O
be O
disassembled O
. O

Two O
months O
later O
, O
10 O
masons O
were O
brought O
in O
, O
Warsaw B-LOC
Jews O
from O
Treblinka B-LOC
, O
2 O
wagons O
of O
food B-TER
and O
bread B-TER
, O
and O
bricks O
, O
and O
construction O
of O
a O
new O
oven O
began O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
said O
at O
that O
time O
that O
this O
oven O
would O
be O
for O
the O
Poles B-LOC
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
making O
use O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
workers B-TER
from O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
were O
assigned O
some O
work B-TER
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
I O
found O
out O
about O
the O
sad O
reality O
at O
camp B-TER
no O
. O

3 O
. O

The O
conversation O
took O
place O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
despite O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
guard O
. O

It O
was O
then O
I O
found O
out O
that O
after O
having O
been O
gassed B-TER
, O
the O
corpses B-TER
were O
buried O
30,000 O
to O
40,000 O
to O
a O
pit O
. O

The O
corpses B-TER
were O
doused O
in O
chlorine O
, O
and O
then O
later O
buried O
. O

When O
the O
pit O
was O
full O
, O
it O
was O
covered O
with O
dirt O
. O

It O
stank O
very O
badly O
despite O
the O
chlorine O
. O

After O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
when O
the O
workers B-TER
asked O
where O
their O
families B-TER
were O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
said O
that O
they O
are O
in O
a O
camp B-TER
in O
Ukraine B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
some O
of O
them O
even O
have O
their O
own O
farms O
as O
independent O
farmers O
, O
and O
that O
they O
would O
see O
them O
in O
two O
weeks O
. O

Sometimes O
a O
clerk O
from O
the O
Arbeitsamt O
in O
Włodawa B-LOC
, O
who O
used O
to O
order O
clothing B-TER
for O
himself O
from O
the O
[ O
dead O
] O
Jews O
’ O
things O
, O
would O
tell O
another O
little O
fairy O
tale O
: O
that O
the O
Jews O
from O
this O
camp B-TER
would O
be O
sent O
to O
Kraków B-LOC
. O

In O
September O
, O
the O
new O
gassing B-TER
equipment O
was O
finished O
. O

It O
had O
8 O
compartments O
that O
could O
each O
hold O
100 O
- O
120 O
people O
. O

This O
way O
, O
1000 O
people O
could O
be O
killed B-TER
at O
one O
time O
. O

After O
this O
factory O
was O
ready O
, O
fresh O
transports B-TER
began O
to O
arrive O
. O

Once O
, O
when O
a O
20 O
- O
wagon O
transport B-TER
arrived O
with O
people O
from O
Biała B-LOC
Podlaska I-LOC
, O
the O
Germans B-TER
decided O
to O
send O
the O
clothes B-TER
, O
underwear B-TER
, O
and O
other O
such O
things O
by O
that O
train B-TER
. O

The O
occupants O
of O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
were O
put O
to O
work O
, O
and O
they O
were O
given O
an O
additional O
200 O
Jews O
from O
the O
new O
transport B-TER
for O
help O
. O

The O
work B-TER
lasted O

When O
one O

, O
his O
son B-TER

was O
walking O
behind O
him O
, O
was O
ordered O

him O

. O

One O
worker B-TER
managed O
to O
hide B-TER
in O
this O
clothing B-TER
transport B-TER
and O

able O
to O

Jews O
( O
permanent B-TER

were O

In O
October O
1942 O
, O
a O
crane O
was O
brought O
in O
, O
and O
they O
began O
to O
take O
corpses B-TER
out O
of O
the O
ground O
and O
burn O
them O
. O

In O
winter O
there O
were O
fewer O
transports B-TER
, O
and O
people O
were O
transported B-TER
barefoot O
. O

The O
children B-TER
in O
the O
trains B-TER
were O
so O
thirsty O
that O
they O
would O
eat O
snow O
. O

In O
the O
spring O
of O
1943 O
, O
trains B-TER
began O
arriving O
with O
Jews O
from O

. O

In O
July O
1943 O
, O
20 O
workers B-TER
went O
outside O
the O
barbed O
wire O
fence O
to O
cut O
down O
trees O
. O

They O
were O
supposed O
to O
construct O
places O
to O
store O
and O
sort O
the O
ammunition O
that O
had O
been O
obtained O
. O

The O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
got O
this O
idea O
when O
they O
saw O
that O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
was O
coming O
to O
an O
end O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
devise O
a O
new O
way O
of O
avoiding O
being O
sent O
to O
the O
front O
. O

While O
at O
work O
, O
the O
heat O
was O
bothering O
them O
terribly O
, O
and O
one O
time O
when O
two O
of O
them O
went O
with O
a O
Ukrainian B-LOC
to O
get O
some O
water O
, O
they O
liquidated O
the O
Ukrainian B-LOC
, O
took O
his O
weapon O
and O
ran B-TER
away I-TER
to O
the O
forest O
. O

The O
officer O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
guard O
, O
having O
figured O
out O
what O
had O
happened O
after O
they O
had O
been O
gone O
a O
long O
time O
, O
surrounded O
the O
remaining O
Jews O
and O
began O
returning O
to O
the O
camp B-TER
. O

Eight O
more O
took O
advantage O
of O
that O
moment O
and O
escaped B-TER
. O

The O
[ O
remaining O
] O
10 O
Jews O
were O
brought O
back O
to O
camp B-TER
with O
their O
hands O
on O
their O
necks O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
worker O
of O
camps B-TER
nos O
. O

1 O
and O
2 O
were O
summoned O
and O
, O
after O
a O
speech O
justifying O
the O
necessity O
of O
carrying O
out O
the O
death B-TER
sentence I-TER
, O
the O
10 O
unlucky O
men O
were O
shot B-TER
. O

In O
his O
speech O
, O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
man I-TER
said O
that O
if O
anything O
like O
that O
ever O
happened O
again O
, O
they O
would O
kill B-TER
half O
of O
the O
camp B-TER
's O
workers B-TER
. O

Ten O
more O

shot B-TER
in O
retaliation O
for O
the O
escape B-TER
one O
night O
of O
two O
other O
Jews O
. O

The O
workers B-TER
had O
to O
stand O
guard O
in O
the O
barracks B-TER
as O
punishment O
, O
and O
the O
windows O
were O
closed O
and O
barbed O
wire O
was O
put O
on O
them O
. O

Jews O
had O
been O
harboring O
thoughts O
of O
revolt B-TER
and O
escape B-TER
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

After O
long O
meetings O
of O
those O
privy O
to O
the O
conspiracy B-TER
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
an O
uprising B-TER
would O
be O
staged O
in O
mid- O
October O
, O
when O
some O
of O
the O
SS B-TER
- I-TER
men I-TER
would O
be O
on O
furlough O
. O

One O
day O
, O
according O
to O
a O
prearranged O
plan O
, O
between O
4 O
and O
5 O
p.m. O
, O
they O
began O
to O
liquidate O
certain O
officers O
in O
closed O
sheds O
and O
barracks B-TER
. O

They O
had O
been O
lured O
to O
those O
places O
under O
various O
pretexts O
. O

The O
camp B-TER
's I-TER
second O
in O
command O
was O
the O
first O
to O
be O
killed B-TER
. O

The O
plan O
was O
carried O
out O
scrupulously O
, O
and O
when O
all O
the O
workers B-TER
assembled O
for O
the O
evening O
roll B-TER
call I-TER
at O
5 O
p.m. O
, O
the O
leaders O
announced O
that O
the O
revolt B-TER
had O
begun O
. O

They O
had O
just O
obtained O
their O
weapons O
. O

A O
group O
of O
Ukrainian B-LOC
guards O
shot B-TER
a O
thick O
barrage O
of O
gunfire O
. O

The O
Jews O
rushed O
at O
the O
barbed O
wire O
with O
axes O
and O
pliers O
, O
and O
wood O
and O
boards O
were O
thrown O
onto O
the O
minefield O
so O
the O
mines O
would O
explode O
. O

After O
a O
short O
and O
intense O
battle O
, O
during O
which O
180 O
people O
died B-TER
, O

up O
into O
