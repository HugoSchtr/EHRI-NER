We O
very O

hear O
the O
negative O
result O

the O

that O
there O
is O
no O

way O

solve O
this O
question O
except O
by O
the O
plan O

The O
families O

many O
children O
cannot O
be O
sent O
to O
Argentine B-LOC
as O
First O

the O
expense O
would O
be O

great O

for O
each O

11,500 O
Crowns O

a O
family O
of O
six O

about O
Five O
hundred O

The O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
on O

is O
worse O
than O
anyone O
can O
imagine O

what O
Mrs. O

when O
she O
visited O
them O

therefore O
, O
under O
the O
cirumstances O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
we O
cannot O
accept O
sole O
responsibility O
for O
these O
poor O
people O

must O
pass O
some O
on O

the O

We O
have O
seen O
their O
unspeakable O

even O
increased O
by O
physical O
torture O

as O
they O
either O
must O
stay O

on O

There O
must O

this O

It O
is O
not O
enough O
that O

suffer O
all O

carefully O
considered O

far O
in O

of O

“ O
I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
considerable O
controversy O
has O
followed O
the O
introduction O
into O
Parliament B-ORG
of O
the O
new O
Jew O
Bill O
. O

The O
Jewish O
and O
the O
Gentile O
press O
came O
to O
grips O
over O
it O
. O

The O
former O
printed O
articles O
by O
prominent O
Gentile O
Hungarians O
, O
many O
of O
the O
aristocracy O
, O
advancing O
the O
argument O
that O
the O
Bill O
was O
contrary O
to O
the O
principles O
of O
Christianity O
, O
violated O
the O
Constitution O
, O
and O
was O
inhumane O
. O

The O
Gentile O
press O
stressed O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
Jews O
to O
assimilate O
, O
their O
practicing O
a O
doctrine O
of O
race O
defense O
, O
their O
inferior O
outlook O
on O
life O
, O
and O
their O
failure O
to O
accept O
the O
general O
principles O
of O
Christian O
morals O
, O
and O
it O
was O
predicted O
that O
the O
Jews O
would O
attempt O
sabotage O
to O
vitiate O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
Bill O
. O

Protests O
against O
the O
Bill O
were O
expressed O
in O
sermons O
delivered O
in O
the O
Budapest B-LOC
synagogues O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Many O
see O
in O
the O
presenting O
of O
this O
drastic O
bill O
a O
clever O
move O
by O
Imrédy B-PERS
to O
steal O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
Hungarian B-ORG
National I-ORG
Socialists I-ORG
, O
to O
produce O
per O
se O
a O
revulsion O
to O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
sentiment O
( O
because O
in O
wide O
circles O
it O
is O
considered O
un- O
Hungarian O
and O
unfair O
) O
, O
and O
to O
make O
Hungary B-LOC
unattractive O
to O
the O
Jews O
of O
neighboring O
countries O
who O
would O
flee O
to O
it O
as O
a O
haven O
from O
persecution O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
In O
the O
last O
analysis O
, O
many O
responsible O
Hungarians O
are O
wondering O
what O
will O
become O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
especially O
the O
poorer O
ones O
, O
when O
they O
are O
deprived O
of O
their O
means O
of O
livelihood O
. O

They O
feel O
that O
the O
Government O
is O
making O
a O
huge O
problem O
for O
itself O
by O
accelerating O
this O
problem O
without O
sufficient O
preparation O
. O

The O
German O
Minister O
told O
me O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
possible O
for O
the O
Hungarians O
to O
carry O
on O
an O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
policy O
as O
they O
conceived O
it O
because O
, O
unlike O
Germany O
, O
there O
were O
no O
skilled O
Gentiles O
to O
replace O
the O
Jews O
. O
” O
A O
revivication O
of O
the O
Iron O
Guard O
movement O
did O
not O
eventuate O
; O

rather O
, O
the O
legionary O
leaders O
have O
been O
shot O
and O
the O
movement O
’s O
strength O
, O
both O
actual O
and O
potential O
, O
is O
greatly O
diminished O
. O

But O
the O
Nazi O
shadow O
still O
looms O
large O
. O

Whether O
the O
German O
threat O
is O
a O
controlling O
or O
only O
a O
contributory O
factor O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
plight O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
this O
country O
has O
grown O
worse O
and O
their O
fears O
are O
greatly O
increased O
. O

The O
Government O
can O
scarcely O
be O
called O
, O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
Goga B-PERS
Government O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
strongly O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
, O
but O
it O
‘ O
recognizes O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
Jewish O
problem O
’ O
and O
many O
are O
constrained O
to O
feel O
that O
although O
the O
Goga B-PERS
and O
Cuza B-PERS
program O
was O
openly O
and O
violently O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
the O
actual O
effect O
of O
the O
measures O
and O
methods O
employed O
by O
the O
present O
regime O
is O
more O
severe O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
there O
is O
no O
out O
- O
and O
- O
out O
pogrom O
and O
that O
Governmental O
regulation O
of O
the O
Jews O
is O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
relatively O
slight O
, O
but O
pressure O
, O
obstacles O
, O
discriminations O
– O
all O
of O
these O
forms O
of O
persecution O
are O
becoming O
noticeably O
more O
numerous O
. O
[ O
... O
] O
The O
attitude O
of O
the O
Romanian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
, O
then O
, O
that O
this O
surplus O
population O
of O
non O
- O
citizen O
Jews O
must O
go O
; O

there O
is O
to O
be O
no O
pogrom O
, O
no O
violence O
, O
no O
brutality O
, O
but O
they O
must O
go O
. O

Until O
a O
place O
is O
found O
for O
them O
and O
an O
arrangement O
is O
made O
for O
them O
to O
get O
there O
they O
will O
probably O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

As O
to O
the O
others O
, O
the O
800,000 O
who O
have O
established O
their O
citizenship O
, O
the O
Government O
points O
to O
their O
citizenship O
as O
a O
guarantee O
of O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
accorded O
to O
others O
, O
although O
admitting O
that O
Jews O
‘ O
will O
probably O
not O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
higher O
positions O
’ O
. O
[ O
... O
] O
The O
Romanians O
are O
not O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
a O
harsh O
or O
vindictive O
people O
; O

they O
are O
, O
rather O
, O
tolerant O
and O
easy O

going O
. O

I O
feel O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
although O
the O
program O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
what O
are O
termed O
the O
‘ O
surplus O
’ O
Jews O
will O
probably O
in O
any O
case O
be O
retained O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
likelihood O
of O
such O
a O
degree O
of O
violence O
or O
severity O
being O
employed O
as O
would O
call O
down O
strong O
criticism O
or O

back O
as O
1918 B-DATE

Under O
his O
project O
these O
temporary O

would O
lose O

Their O
political O
rights O

( O
Anti O

, O
it O
is O
still O
true O
, O
as O
was O
then O
the O
case O
, O
that O
the O
Polish B-LOC
Government O
feels O
that O
the O
time O
is O
not O
ripe O
yet O
for O
the O
enactment O
of O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
legislation O
as O
such O
. O

However O
, O
the O
significant O
point O
in O
this O
report O
is O
that O
the O
tendency O
and O
trend O
of O
public O
opinion O
is O
in O
that O
direction O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
the O
Government O
still O
endeavors O
to O
side O
- O
step O
the O
main O
issue O
, O
but O
working O
through O
OZON B-ORG
, O
continues O
its O
policy O
of O
guarded O
discrimination O
, O
limiting O
Jewish O
activity O
wherever O
possible O
without O
direct O
racial O
reference O
. O

Temporizing O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
the O
Government O
hopes O
to O
avoid O
hostile O
foreign O
censure O
, O
placate O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
circles O
here O
, O
and O
not O
to O
arouse O
Jewish O
apprehension O
or O
enmity O
. O

The O
Government O
is O
under O
no O
illusion O
, O
however O
, O
but O
that O
eventually O
this O
issue O
will O
have O
to O
be O
faced O
squarely O
. O

[ O
... O
] O
Indeed O
, O
it O
is O
characteristic O
of O
Bohemia B-LOC
, O
where O
nationality O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
language O
rather O
than O
of O
blood O
, O
that O
speech O
rather O
than O
origin O
is O
the O
distinguishing O
characteristic O
of O
friend O
or O
foe O
. O

Such O
resentment O
of O
the O
Jews O
as O
exists O
in O
Bohemia B-LOC
thus O
centers O
largely O
on O
the O
German O
- O
speaking O
Jews O
– O
particularly O
those O
who O
have O
come O
to O
Bohemia B-LOC
since O
the O
war O
. O

Among O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
themselves O
, O
there O
is O
comparatively O
little O
anti O

semitism O
. O

Only O
the O
small O
Czech B-LOC
fascist O
groups O
and O
certain O
sections O
of O
the O
nationalist O
- O
conservative O
element O
are O
anti O
- O
semitic O
. O

This O
applies O
particularly O
to O
the O
younger O
element O
in O
the O
New B-ORG
National I-ORG
Unity I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
is O
being O
organized O
as O
a O
government O
party O
. O

All O
these O
elements O
together O
, O
however O
, O
make O
up O
only O
a O
small O
minority O
of O
the O
Czech B-LOC
population O
. O

The O
mass O
of O
the O
people O
appear O
simply O
to O
have O
very O
little O
interest O
in O
anti O
- O
semitism O
. O

The O
present O
talk O
of O
anti O
- O
semitic O
measures O
and O
the O
general O
anxiety O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
is O
due O
principally O
to O
the O
pressure O
which O
is O
being O
brought O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Government O
by O
Berlin B-LOC
in O
the O
direction O
of O
an O
anti O

policy O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
this O
pressure O
. O
[ O

Very O
little O
has O
happened O

justify O
the O
panicky O

prevailed O
in O

circles O
here O

the O

The O

In O
the O
larger O
cities O
they O
form O
a O
wealthy O
class O
which O
makes O
up O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
intelligentsia O
and O
controls O
a O
very O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
capital O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
educated O
Jews O
are O
Hungarian B-LOC
-speaking O
and O
have O
always O
looked O
to O
Budapest B-LOC
for O
cultural O
inspiration O
. O

A O
smaller O
but O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
number O
have O
had O
a O
German B-LOC
cultural O
orientation O
. O

This O
doubtless O
explains O
to O
a O
large O
extent O
the O
feeling O
prevalent O
in O
many O
Slovak B-LOC
circles O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
Jews O
have O
always O
sided O
with O
the O
oppressors O
of O
the O
Slovaks B-LOC
, O
against O
the O
native O
population O
. O

[ O
... O

As O
will O
have O
been O
seen O
from O
the O
above O
discussion O
, O
the O
Jewish O
question O
in O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
presents O
a O
highly O
confused O
picture O
. O

The O
Jews O
themselves O
fall O
into O
many O
different O
categories O
, O
varying O
from O
the O
highly O
cultured O
intellectuals O
of O
Prague B-LOC
to O
the O
pious O
and O
primitive O
orthodox O
Jews O
of O
the O
Slovak B-LOC
and O
Ruthenian O
villages O
. O

They O
are O
divided O
among O
various O
cultural O
tendencies O
: O

Yiddish O
, O
German B-LOC
, O
Hungarian B-LOC
, O
Polish B-LOC
and O
Czechoslovak B-LOC
. O

The O
attitude O
of O
the O
Aryan O
population O
toward O
them O
varies O
again O
, O
between O
city O
and O
country O
, O
between O
the O
various O
classes O
and O
professions O
, O
between O
the O
different O
provinces O
. O

In O
these O
circumstances O
, O
it O
is O
scarcely O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
any O
clear O
- O
cut O
policy O
or O
attitude O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
responsible O
authorities O
will O
emerge O
. O

It O
seems O
evident O
that O
if O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
existed O
in O
a O
vacuum O
the O
Jews O
, O
despite O
their O
considerable O
number O
, O
would O
not O
present O
any O
problem O
which O
could O
not O
be O
solved O
with O
relatively O
humane O
and O
painless O
methods O
. O

The O
country O
does O
not O
contain O
in O
itself O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
really O
serious O
and O
widespread O
anti O
- O
semitic O
movement O
. O

note O

Primarily O
, O
the O
class O
of O

to O

considered O
officially O

its O
economic O

increased O
, O
thus O
creating O
a O
sort O
of O
second O

This O
represents O
the O
real O
compromise O
made O
between O
the O
two O
houses B-ORG

Also O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
placing O
the O
Jews O
in O
a O
distinct O
category O
for O

purposes O
was O
discarded O

Instead O
, O
the O

retain O
free O

the O
conditions O

enfranchisement O

Agricultural O

Dear O

situation O
has O
worsened O
considerably O

since O

September O
of O
the O

year O
, O
when O
I O
last O
reported O

the O
conditions O
here O

By O
the O
messages O
I O
have O
received O
I O
am O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
State O
Protector O
and O
several O
of O
his O
officials O
sincerely O
wanted O
to O
establish O
a O
good O
relationship O
between O
Germans B-LOC
and O
Czechs B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
the O
party B-ORG
with O
the O
Sudeten B-LOC
German O
Secretary O
of O
State O
, O
Mr. O
Frank B-PERS
at O
the O
helm O
have O
completely O
lacked O
the O
tact O
needed O
or O
they O
may O
have O
thought O
that O
with O
hardness O
one O
should O
suppress O
any O
resistance O
from O
the O
Czechs B-LOC

Now O
you O
can O
see O
a O
Germanization B-ORG
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
in O
all O
areas O
. O

Many O
Czech O
estates O
, O
whose O
owners O
at O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
stayed O
abroad O
and O
did O
not O
return O
home O
, O
and O
estates O
which O
, O
at O
the O
demarcation O
, O
were O
located O
partly O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
and O
partly O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
, O
are O
placed O
under O
German O
administration O
. O

It O
is O
expected O
, O
that O
similar O
extensions O
will O
take O
place O
in O
regard O
to O
German B-LOC
Colonization O
. O

Jewish O
businesses O
are O
mostly O
being O
handed O
over O
to O
Germans O
. O

In O
Banks O
and O
Industrial O
Enterprises O
, O
there O
is O
strong O
pressure O
from O
the O
German B-LOC
side O
for O
mergers O
and O
transactions O
, O
so O
that O
the O
main O
influence O
of O
the O
company O
in O
question O
can O
be O
transferred O
to O
rich O
German B-LOC
banks O
. O

Perhaps O
some O
of O
these O
transactions O
- O
as O
a O
bank O
director O
familiar O
with O
Czech O
transactions O
in O
the O
post O
- O
World O
Bank O
banking O
sector O
, O
has O
told O
me O
- O
are O
merely O
restitutions O
, O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
German B-LOC
proceed O
with O
greater O
severity O
and O
consistency O
than O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
in O
this O
regard O
. O

Bohemia B-LOC
and I-LOC
Moravia I-LOC
, O
there O
were O
no O
food O
shortages O
and O
before O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
there O
were O
large O
supplies O
and O
industrial O
goods O
of O
great O
quality O
. O

In O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
, O
the O
stocks O
have O
been O
emptied O
and O
a O
rationing O
system O
has O
been O
introduced O
. O

The O
rationing O
is O
not O
yet O
as O
widespread O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
but O
it O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
before O
this O
happens O
and O
then O
there O
will O
be O
a O
" O
Gleichschaltung O
" O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Dualism O
in O
the O
Administration O
contributes O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
demand O
for O
rationed O
consumer O
goods O
is O
hardly O
as O
well O
organized O
as O
in O
the O
German B-LOC
Empire I-LOC
. O

People O
often O
go O
to O
buy O
items O
, O
which O
according O
to O
the O
card O
system O
should O
be O
available O
just O
to O
find O
out O
that O
it O
is O
not O
. O

After O
the O
Munich O
Decree O
last O
year O
, O
the O
diminished O
territory O
of O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
was O
established O
, O
and O
many O
Czechs B-LOC
believed O
that O
with O
a O
little O
goodwill O
they O
could O
establish O
great O
relations O
with O
the O
German O
Empire O
. O

After O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
, O
a O
few O
people O
still O
hoped O
this O
was O
possible O
but O
now O
you O
won’t O
find O
a O
single O
Czech O
person O
that O
doesn’t O
feel O
resentment O
against O
Germany O
. O

I O
don’t O
think O
that O
these O
feelings O
will O
cause O
any O
outbreaks O
as O
long O
as O
the O
German O
discipline O
stands O
firm O
. O

The O
people O
are O
not O
armed O
and O
they O
know O
that O
the O
German B-ORG
troops I-ORG
and O
the O
German O
police O
will O
suppress O
any O
demonstration O
with O
extreme O
brutality O
. O

In O
the O
first O
period O
of O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
there O
where O
arrests O
among O
the O
supporters O
of O
Beneš B-PERS
' I-PERS
, O
undesired O
politicians O
, O
legionaries O
, O
and O
others O
. O

However O
, O
many O
of O
the O
arrested O
have O
since O
been O
released O
and O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
main O
clash O
with O
Germans O
and O
people O
not O
well O
regarded O
by O
them O
had O
taken O
place O
. O

When O
the O
war O
broke O
out O
, O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
activity O
increased O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
before O
- O
mentioned O
, O
a O
large O
number O
of O
members O
of O
the O
Military O
were O
now O
also O
arrested O
, O
as O
well O
as O
people O
from O
the O
industries O
, O
clerics O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Ever O
since O
it O
looks O
like O
the O
arrests O
won’t O
stop O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
see O
a O
system O
in O
the O
actions O
of O
Gestapo B-ORG
, O
you O
might O
see O
this O
as O
taking O
hostages O
. O

A O
former O
Czech O
politician O
and O
diplomat O
, O
which O
has O
been O
retired O
for O
several O
years O
, O
told O
me O
about O
some O
of O
the O
arrests O
. O

He O
told O
about O
how O
certain O
people O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
's I-ORG
list O
of O
arrests O
had O
remained O
in O
Freedom O
– O
at O
least O
until O
now O
– O
just O
because O
they O
were O
not O
at O
home O
when O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
came O
for O
them O
, O
so O
the O
police O
went O
on O
to O
the O
next O
one O
on O
the O
list O
. O

My O
informant O
told O
me O
that O
he O
changed O
his O
residence O
because O
he O
was O
afraid O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
arrested O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
arrested O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration B-CAMP
camp I-CAMP
Buchenwald I-CAMP
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

A O
reliable O
source O
told O
me O
that O
the O
internees O
are O
treated O
just O
as O
it O
is O
described O
in O
the O
newly O
published O
English O
white O
paper O
about O
German O
concentration O
camps O
. O

The O
prominent O
Jews O
, O
the O
ones O
who O
lived O
there O
before O
the O
World O
War O
, O
are O
not O
as O
affected O
by O
the O
Jewish O
persecutions O
as O
others O
. O

I O
know O
of O
several O
examples O
of O
Jewish O
Bank O
Directors O
, O
although O
retired O
, O
that O
are O
working O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
daily O
in O
the O
Bank O
to O
explain O
the O
conditions O
to O
the O
new O
Managers O
and O
live O
peacefully O
in O
their O
villas O
. O

However O
, O
they O
had O
to O
turn O
in O
their O
cars O
and O
radios O
. O

I O
have O
also O
heard O
of O
Jewish O
lawyers O
that O
work O
from O
home O
and O
then O
have O
their O
Aryan O
colleagues O
take O
the O
cases O
to O
court O
. O

Some O
Jewish O
doctors O
have O
been O
given O
temporary O
work O
in O
hospitals O
. O

Jews O
who O
can’t O
prove O
a O
permanent O
residence O
in O
the O
Protectorate B-LOC
seem O
to O
be O
facing O
very O
bad O
times O
. O

They O
will O
probably O
all O
be O
transferred O
to O
Poland B-LOC
, O
to O
the O
regions O
around O
Lemberg B-LOC
. O

From O
Mährisch B-LOC
Ostrau I-LOC
, O
many O
Hundreds O
of O
Jews O
have O
already O
been O
sent O
to O
this O
area O
to O
do O
Labour O
service O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
great O
relocation O

Under O
the O
conditions O
described O
above O
, O
the O
former O
Czechoslovakia O
National O
Day O
, O
on O
October O
28 O
, O
was O
met O
with O
great O
anxiety O
. O

When O
it O
was O
reported O
that O
the O
Czechs B-LOC
wanted O
to O
grieve O
that O
day O
, O
the O
Germans O
had O
planned O
a O
mourning O
ceremony O
for O
the O
fallen O
people O
in O
Poland O
. O

The O
Czechs B-LOC
then O
canceled O
their O
plans O
, O
and O
the O
Czech O
national O
unity O
party O
ordered O
its O
members O
to O
stay O
indoors O
and O
keep O
calm O
. O

The O
Germans O
also O
distanced O
themselves O
from O
holding O
the O
mourning O
ceremony O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
Labour O
Day O
, O
the O
traffic O
in O
the O
main O
streets O
was O
very O
busy O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
prohibition O
, O
many O
Czech O
people O
wore O
cockades O
with O
silk O
ribbons O
in O
the O
Czechoslovakia O
colours O
, O
and O
many O
male O
persons O
covered O
their O
heads O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
cap O
of O
as O
the O
late O
President O
Masaryk B-PERS
usually O
wore O
. O

All O
the O
Czech B-ORG
Police I-ORG
was O
stationed O
in O
the O
Main O
Streets O
and O
the O
German B-ORG
Police I-ORG
and O
S.S. B-ORG
-members O
had O
taken O
up O
positions O
as O
a O
reserve O
in O
side O
streets O
and O
passages O
. O

The O
tensions O
erupted O
into O
fights O
as O
large O
sections O
the O
S.A. B-ORG
-members O
passed O
through O
the O
main O
streets O
with O
music O
, O
and O
various O
clashes O
between O
the O
Czech O
people O
's O
groups O
and O
the O
police O
took O
place O
. O

In O
some O
streets O
, O
the O
Communists O
demonstrated O
, O
and O
German O
police O
had O
to O
support O
the O
Czech O
police O
to O
get O
the O
streets O
cleared O
. O

During O
the O
clashes O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
persons O
( O
allegedly O
a O
dozen O
people O
) O
were O
killed O
and O
some O
of O
them O
were O
injured O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
young O
people O
were O
arrested O
. O

However O
, O
in O
view O
of O
the O
population O
’s O
agitated O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
the O
events O
must O
be O
considered O
less O
serious O
than O
one O
might O
have O
expected O
. O

This O
was O
also O
stated O
to O
me O
by O
a O
German O
Official O
from O
the O
Chancellor B-PERS
's I-PERS
Office O
. O

However O
, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
that O
the O
incidents O
will O
give O
rise O
to O
new O
reprisals O
against O
the O
Czechs B-LOC

and O
the O
resentment O
against O
the O
Germans O
will O
then O
be O
further O
increased O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
content O
of O
the O
legal O
status O
of O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
, O
firstly O
, O
that O
after O
the O
abolition O
of O
the O
old O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
laws O
in O
year O
1919 O
there O
was O
no O
legal O
difference O
between O
a O
Jew O
and O
a O
non O
- O
Jew O
[ O
… O
] O
. O

Until O
recently O
, O
if O
a O
Jew O
had O
a O
Romanian B-LOC
nationality O
, O
facing O
the O
law O
he O
had O
the O
same O
rights O
as O
any O
other O
Romanian B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
crucial O
to O
note O
this O
fact O
, O
since O
it O
explains O
all O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
law O
. O

In O
general O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
although O
everything O
depends O
on O
how O
the O
individual O
points O
of O
this O
law O
are O
going O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
in O
real O
life O
, O
right O
now O
it O
seems O
that O
it O
ended O
up O
quite O
benevolent O
for O
the O
Jews O
. O

This O
relative O
benevolence O
, O
however O
, O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
there O
was O
not O
enough O
will O
and O
determination O
at O
the O
relevant O
places O
to O
proceed O
more O
radically O
, O
rather O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
that O
it O
’s O
the O
missing O
resources O
, O
since O
the O
Jews O
play O
a O
very O
important O
role O
in O
the O
economic O
life O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

If O
they O
were O
suddenly O
excluded O
from O
all O
of O
the O
activities O
, O
it O
could O
have O
unpleasant O
results O
on O
all O
of O
the O
economic O
life O
. O

So O
it O
seems O
that O
for O
these O
reasons O
the O
Jews O
had O
to O
be O
divided O
into O
3 O
categories O
and O
the O
second O
category O
, O
especially O
all O
the O
Jewish O
frontline O
soldiers O
, O
are O
keeping O
almost O
all O
the O
rights O
, O
with O
some O
exceptions O
existing O
. O

With O
the O
new O
status O
, O
the O
first O
and O
the O
third O
category O
have O
, O
however O
, O
fairly O
limited O
options O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
some O
employments O
although O
they O
are O
not O
“ O
expressis O
verbis O
” O
prohibited O
from O
doing O
business O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
a O
Jew O
from O
these O
categories O
cannot O
be O
a O
member O
of O
any O
executive O
board O
anymore O
. O

A O
general O
ban O
is O
placed O
on O
all O
the O
categories O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
ownership O
of O
rural O
land O
. O

This O
is O
nothing O
new O
for O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
circumstances O
, O
since O
a O
similar O
ban O
was O
formally O
valid O
in O
the O
old O
kingdom O
area O
up O
until O
1919 O
, O
if O
I O
am O
not O
being O
mistaken O
, O
when O
it O
was O
removed O
by O
the O
liberal O
regime O
. O

I O
have O
to O
repeat O
myself O
by O
saying O
that O
at O
first O
glance O
the O
law O
seems O
to O
be O
quite O
benevolent O
for O
the O
local O
Jews O
and O
the O
information O
I O
am O
getting O
from O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
Christian O
bankers O
is O
that O
a O
weight O
was O
put O
off O
their O
hearts O
. O

The O
business O
in O
the O
banks O
has O
almost O
completely O
stopped O
due O
to O
the O
Jews O
fearing O
the O
upcoming O
law O
and O
now O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
the O
economic O
and O
financial O
life O
will O
come O
alive O
again O
, O
since O
the O
economic O
crisis O
is O
gone O
for O
now O
. O

It O
was O
a O
similar O
economic O
crisis O
to O
the O
one O
which O
forced O
the O
government O
of O
Goga B-PERS
– O
Cuza B-PERS
to O
capitulat O
. O

Their O
strong O
nationalist O
and O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
program O
caused O
Jews O
to O
freak O
out O
and O
to O
stop O
trading O
, O
which O
hurt O
all O
of O
the O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
legal O
status O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
is O
, O
thus O
, O
much O
less O
brutal O
than O
the O
one O
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
for O
example O
, O
and O
it O
could O
be O
compared O
“ O
mutatis O
mutandis O
” O
to O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
not O
be O
forgotten O
that O
it O
is O
only O
the O
first O
of O
the O
legal O
steps O
and O
is O
being O
less O
severe O
out O
of O
caution O
. O

This O
step O
can O
be O
followed O
by O
others O
, O
if O
the O
situation O
asks O
for O
it O
, O
which O
could O
touch O
the O
lives O
of O
Jews O
much O
more O
and O
with O
severe O
impact O
, O
since O
the O
nationalists O
are O
most O
probably O
not O
going O
to O
be O
very O
happy O
about O
this O
law O
and O
are O
expected O
to O
ask O
for O
further O
steps O
in O
time O
. O

To O
the O
topic O
of O
the O
law O
against O
the O
mixed O
marriages O
I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
, O
that O
this O
law O
protecting O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
race O
is O
not O
of O
any O
major O
practical O
relevance O
, O
since O
based O
on O
my O
information O
, O
the O
mixed O
marriages O
have O
never O
threatened O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
race O
, O
although O
there O
were O
many O
of O
them O
, O
and O
[ O
... O
] O
the O
number O
of O
the O
mixed O

has O
almost O
declined O
to O
almost O
zero O

on O
the O

to O
appease O
the O

by O
restraining O
molestation O
of O
all O

while O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
proceeding O
with O
such O
discriminatory O

as O
those O
just O
mentioned O
Law O
for O
the O

of O
the O
College O
of O
Doctors O
, O
stipulates O
that O
only O
Rumanian O
citizens O
enjoying O
full O
civil O
rights O
can O
be O
members O
, O
therefore O
excluding O
Jews O
. O

Some O
are O
suspected O
of O
clandestinely O
encouraging O
attacks O
on O
the O
Jews O
because O
of O
their O
conviction O
that O
( O
a O
) O
this O
is O
the O
solution O
of O
the O
entire O

problem O
and O
( O
b O
) O
it O
will O
curry O
favor O
with O

Rumanians O
in O
general O
seem O
to O
wish O
to O
wreak O
their O
wrath O
either O
actively O
or O
passively O
on O
the O
Jews O
for O
the O
events O
which O
have O

the O

are O

the O
Jews O
, O
either O
aided O
or O
encouraged O
by O
communists O
and O
other O
members O
of O
the O
local O

rose O
against O
the O

at O
the O

Continual O
reports O
of O
persecutions O
and O
killings O
of O
Jews O
in O
the O
provinces O
, O
particularly O
in O
Moldavian B-LOC
villages O
and O
towns O
along O
the O
new O

, O
are O
drifting O
into O
Bucharest B-LOC
daily O
, O
but O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
ascertain O
just O
what O
proportion O
of O
them O
may O
be O
true O
. O

I O
have O
the O
honor O
to O
report O
that O
Ambassador O
Stoica B-PERS
, O
formerly O
Ambassador O
at O
Ankara B-LOC
and O
now O
Under O
Secretary O
of O
Propaganda O
, O
told O
me O
the O
other O
evening O
at O
dinner O
at O
my O
house O
in O
honor O
of O
himself O
and O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
American B-LOC
newspapers O
, O
that O
his O
Government B-ORG
was O
going O
to O
do O
everything O
within O
its O
power O
to O
prevent O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
outbreaks O
, O
but O
that O
it O
greatly O
feared O
such O
outbreaks O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Army O
as O
the O
latter O
was O
so O
incensed O
at O
the O
treatment O
meted O
out O
to O
it O
by O
the O
Jews O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
when O
it O
was O
withdrawing O
. O

I O
observed O
that O
for O
once O
Rumania B-LOC
had O
a O
good O
press O
in O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
where O
there O
was O
great O
sympathy O
because O
it O
had O
been O
set O
upon O
by O
a O
powerful O
nation O
of O
180,000,000 O
people O
, O
and O
that O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
pity O
to O
sacrifice O
this O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
Pogrom O
or O
two O
. O

On O
another O
recent O
occasion O
I O
had O
an O
opportunity O
informally O
to O
emphasize O
to O
Prime O
Minister O
Gigurtu B-PERS
that O
any O
internal O
disturbance O
, O
especially O
Jewish O
persecution O
, O
might O
easily O
be O
seized O
upon O
by O
Russia B-LOC
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
further O
action O
. O
[ O
... O
] O
The O
Gigurtu B-PERS
group O
maintains O
that O
to O
pass O
rigid O
laws O
against O
Jews O
at O
the O
present O
critical O
moment O
would O
seriously O
affect O
the O
economic O
structure O
of O
the O
State O
, O
as O
well O
as O
create O
a O
most O
unfortunate O
impression O
among O
nations O
abroad O
, O
particularly O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
. O

Some O
observers O
take O
the O
view O
that O
should O
there O
be O
no O
further O
pressure O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Bulgaria B-LOC
for O
territorial O
cession O
at O
present O
the O
moderate O
group O
will O
win O
its O
point O
and O
there O
will O
be O
no O
strong O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
reaction O
in O
Rumania B-LOC
; O

if O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Government O
is O
forced O
to O
cede O
more O
territory O
immediately O
, O
a O
cession O
for O
which O
public O
opinion O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
adequately O
prepared O
, O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
thesis O
will O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
win O
because O
the O
Government O
will O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
resort O
to O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
agitation O
as O
a O
cloak O
and O
counter O
- O
irritant O
. O

In O
recent O
days O
a O
few O
mild O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
have O
been O
announced O
but O
nothing O
to O
suggest O
a O
really O
vicious O
program O
. O
[ O
... O
] O
I O
accordingly O
feel O
that O
no O
really O
strong O
Jewish O
persecutions O
are O
apt O
to O
eventuate O
in O
the O
near O
future O
except O
as O
they O
may O
arise O
out O
of O
new O
circumstances O
created O
by O
the O

167/40 O
Probably O
the O
most O
important O
issue O
of O
the O
internal O
politics O
of O
Mr. O
Gigurtu´s B-PERS
government O
is O
the O
adjustment O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
. O

It O
is O
not O
only O
an O
important O
question O
of O
the O
internal O
politics O
, O
which O
would O
be O
no O
more O
than O
a O
logical O
resolution O
of O
the O
new O
orientation O
of O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
politics O
overall O
and O
which O
would O
adjust O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
towards O
the O
new O
order O
. O

It O
is O
a O
much O
more O
important O
problem O
, O
since O
it O
reaches O
maybe O
way O
too O
far O
into O
the O
overall O
economic O
structure O
of O
modern O
Romania B-LOC
. O

I O
have O
to O
point O
out O
right O
at O
the O
beginning O
that O
it O
is O
not O
only O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
one O
or O
the O
other O
of O
the O
important O
industrial O
or O
business O
company O
is O
owned O
by O
Jews O
and O
that O
a O
radical O
Aryanization O
is O
needed O
. O

All O
that O
would O
not O
be O
such O
a O
big O
problem O
and O
could O
be O
carried O
out O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
, O
following O
the O
example O
of O
Germany O
, O
radically O
but O
without O
any O
severe O
damages O
to O
the O
economy O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
much O
more O
complicated O
due O
to O
the O
exceptional O
situation O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
wealthy O
country O
is O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
capital B-LOC
in O
the O
companies O
of O
non- O
Romanian B-LOC
origin O
. O

Mostly O
it O
is O
Jewish O
, O
but O
also O
British B-LOC
, O
French B-LOC
, O
from O
Belgium B-LOC
and O
from O
Netherlands B-LOC
. O

This O
side O
of O
the O
situation O
is O
the O
one O
which O
can O
bring O
major O
issues O
for O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
economy O
if O
not O
handled O
very O
carefully O
. O

Voices O
are O
growing O
louder O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
British B-LOC
capital O
has O
already O
been O
withdrawn O
, O
since O
Romania B-LOC
is O
seen O
as O
a O
country O
definitely O
in O
the O
interest O
area O
of O
the O
German O
Reich O
. O

As O
proof O
of O
this O
claim O
, O
it O
is O
reported O
that O
the O
British B-LOC
sold O
at O
the O
last O
moment O
participation O
in O
some O
of O
the O
most O
important O
oil O
companies O
to O
Russia B-LOC
, O
even O
below O
value O
, O
just O
to O
upset O
both O
Romania B-LOC
and O
Germany O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
the O
sources O
of O
foreign O
capital O
– O
the O
sources O
so O
much O
needed O
for O
a O
country O
as O
Romania B-LOC
which O
is O
weak O
on O
capital O
, O
since O
the O
Romanian O
population O
does O
not O
invest O
the O
money O
and O
the O
money O
is O
not O
within O
the O
estates O
and O
houses O
[ O
... O
] O
– O
will O
be O
suddenly O
cut O
off O
and O
thus O
a O
new O
and O
much O
stronger O
financial O
and O
economic O
crisis O
will O
occur O
. O

The O
local O
Jews O
, O
afraid O
, O
have O
already O
cut O
off O
any O
further O
businesses O
, O
theydo O
not O
dislodge O
goods O
that O
accumulate O
at O
customs O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
make O
any O
new O
trades O
or O
transaction O
. O

They O
are O
gathering O
money O
and O
investing O
it O
into O
volatile O
values O
, O
such O
as O
diamonds O
, O
dollar O
bills O
, O
etc. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
they O
are O
not O
even O
trying O
to O
sabotage O
anything O
; O

rather O
they O
are O
worried O
for O
the O
future O
of O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
, O
which O
will O
certainly O
to O
be O
very O
difficult O
. O

The O
crisis O
is O
definitely O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
, O
since O
the O
German O
capital O
cannot O
come O
into O
effect O
straight O
away O
and O
if O
Romania B-LOC
was O
under O
threat O
of O
losing O
another O
territory O
to O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
Bulgaria B-LOC
, O
after O
already O
losing O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bukovina B-LOC
, O
the O
extend O
of O
the O
crisis O
could O
be O
devastating O
. O

Current O
national O
budget O
of O
about O
130 O
billion O
is O
already O
a O
heavy O
load O
for O
this O
diminished O
territory O
and O
if O
there O
were O
to O
be O
other O
civil O
servants O
returning O
to O
Romania B-LOC
, O
those O
from O
the O
territories O
Romania B-LOC
could O
lose O
, O
the O
financial O
burden O
would O
be O
way O
too O
big O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

These O
are O
serious O
perspectives O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
a O
sheer O
Jewish O
misconception O
and O
propaganda O
to O
protect O
their O
positions O
, O
therefore O
the O
solutions O
the O
government O
is O
about O
to O
take O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
are O
very O
intensely O
awaited O
at O
this O
moment O
. O

If O
the O
solution O
is O
rational O
time O
- O
wise O
and O
also O
prepared O
( O
and O
so O
far O
there O
are O
no O
causes O
, O
even O
among O
the O
smaller O
officers O
, O
already O
manifesting O
dissatisfaction O
of O
the O
anti- O
Jewish O
sentiment O
to O
expect O
the O
government O
to O
act O
hastily O
) O
, O
the O
chances O
that O
the O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
will O
bring O
on O
a O
central O
crisis O
will O
be O
at O
least O
smaller O
. O

However O
, O
if O
the O
government O
does O
not O
proceed O
carefully O
, O
it O
could O
be O
facing O
such O
major O
failures O
as O
the O
nationalist O
government O
of O
the O
late O
Octavian B-PERS
Goga I-PERS
did O
. O

His O
government O
had O
to O
be O
removed O
after O
only O
two O
months O
of O
its O
existence O
; O

therefore O
Romania B-LOC
was O
threatened O
by O
a O
major O
economical O
and O
financial O
crisis O
. O

Very O
similar O
aspects O
are O
now O
reappearing O
, O
awaiting O
the O
solutions O
to O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
, O
therefore O
an O
objective O
observer O
needs O
to O
be O
thinking O
of O
this O
unpleasant O
precedent O
[ O
... O
] O
however O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
forgotten O
that O
the O
government O
of O
Mr. O
Gigurtu B-PERS
has O
a O
very O
practical O
national O
economist O
and O
financial O
expert O
– O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
himself O
. O

He O
must O
be O
aware O
of O
the O
difficulties O
connected O
to O
this O
situation O
and O
therefore O
he O
will O
definitely O
proceed O
very O
rationally O
and O
as O
carefully O
as O
it O
is O
necessary O
, O
given O
the O
circumstances O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
Minister O
of O
the O
National O
Economy O
, O
who O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
well O
- O
known O
national O
economist O
, O
oversees O
all O
the O
so O
called O
economical O
resorts O
, O
thus O
he O
has O
the O
necessary O
possibilities O
of O
a O
united O
progress O
and O
can O
avoid O
any O
conflicts O
in O
the O
competencies O
of O

. O

Based O
on O
all O
the O
mentioned O
reasons O
I O
can O
express O
my O
hope O
that O
the O
government O
will O
solve O
the O
urgent O

without O

about O

I O
would O
like O
to O
announce O
that O
the O
Ministries O
and O
all O
the O

offices O
issued O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
internal O
decrees O
to O
get O
the O
Jewish O
law O
carried O
out O
in O
their O
area O
of O
competence O
and O
to O
get O
the O
Jews O
working O
as O
civil O
servants O
immediately O
eliminated O
from O
their O
positions O
. O

The O
list O
of O
names O
of O
such O
Jews O
stripped O
of O
their O
positions O
was O
given O
to O
print O
. O

As O
an O
interesting O
fact O
I O
would O
like O
to O
also O
state O
, O
that O
also O
Jews O
who O
held O
their O
official O
functions O
at O
the O
withdrawn O
areas O
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bukovina B-LOC
were O
a O
part O
of O
this O
list O
. O

This O
brought O
a O
smile O
to O
the O
faces O
of O
critical O
people O
; O

however O
its O
purpose O
was O
to O
prevent O
these O
Jews O
– O
clerks O
from O
the O
areas O
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
northern O
Bukovina B-LOC
– O
from O
getting O
employed O
as O
civil O
servants O
back O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
critical O
voices O
from O
the O
local O
diplomatic O
corps O
can O
be O
also O
heard O
, O
since O
according O
to O
them O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
Jews O
as O
civil O
servants O
was O
an O
easy O
one O
to O
solve O
because O
there O
were O
not O
many O
of O
them O
and O
none O
at O
the O
leading O
positions O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
the O
carrying O
out O
of O
the O
Jewish O
law O
faces O
some O
issues O
as O
well O
, O
coming O
from O
standards O
governing O
this O
issue O
. O

The O
legal O
decrees O
about O
the O
National O
party O
state O
that O
only O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Party O
can O
become O
a O
member O
of O
an O
executive O
board O
and O
vice O
- O
versa O
[ O
... O
] O
the O
law O
states O
that O
a O
Jew O
cannot O
become O
a O
member O
of O
the O
National O
party O
at O
all O
. O

This O
law O
, O
thus O
, O
does O
not O
give O
Jews O
a O
chance O
to O
remain O
members O
of O
the O
executive O
boards O
of O
companies O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
Jewish O
law O
( O
see O
the O
quoted O
report O
) O
prevents O
only O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
first O
and O
the O
third O
category O
to O
become O
members O
of O
executive O
boards O
and O
does O
not O
create O
any O
obstacles O
for O
the O
Jews O
of O
the O
second O
category O
. O

From O
all O
of O
that O
a O
practical O
question O
arises O
in O
the O
companies O
, O
that O
is O
which O
of O
the O
two O
legal O
decrees O
is O
valid O
. O

It O
is O
only O
natural O
that O
the O
Jews O
are O
trying O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
more O
convenient O
Jewish O
law O
with O
all O
the O
means O
possible O
, O
since O
based O
on O
the O
information O
I O

it O
is O
not O

to O

to O
be O
in O
the O
second O
category O
, O
because O
the O
competent O
offices O
are O
making O
operative O
steps O
in O
this O
issue O
and O
are O
supposedly O
dismissing O
also O
those O
proofs O
which O
satisfy O
the O
formal O
requirements O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
whether O
I O
am O
mistaken O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
differences O
between O
the O
legal O
decrees O
are O
not O
coincidental O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
imagine O
such O
frivolousness O
, O
especially O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
such O
an O
important O
issue O
for O
Romanian B-LOC
economic O
life O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
can O
be O
assumed O
that O
it O
is O
something O
intended O
for O
great O
deal O
of O
elasticity O
in O
this O
issue O
. O

The O
inconsistency O
in O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
decrees O
can O
be O
seen O
also O
within O
the O
army O
, O
where O
each O
of O
the O
divisions O
applies O
the O
decrees O
individually O
. O

I O
was O
informed O
about O
cases O
where O
regiments O
simply O
demobilized O
a O
Jewish O
rank O
and O
sent O
it O
home O
. O

The O
other O
regiment O
, O
however O
, O
sent O
a O
Jewish O
rank O
home O
in O
uniforms O
and O
told O
them O
to O
come O
back O
in O
their O
plain O
clothes O
to O
then O
decide O
their O
fate O
. O

Finally O
the O
third O
regiment O
demobilized O
its O
Jewish O
rank O
immediately O
, O
however O
they O
were O
told O
to O
come O
back O
every O
morning O
and O
every O
afternoon O
in O
their O
plain O
clothes O
to O
ask O
about O
any O
work O
that O
comes O
up O
. O

Similar O
inconsistent O
solutions O
are O
possible O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
local O
administrative O
customs O
. O

The O
overall O
picture O
one O
gets O
from O
these O
individual O
events O
is O
that O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
, O
the O
steps O
taken O
are O
going O
to O
depend O
on O
the O
given O
situation O
and O
will O
be O
opportunistic O
enough O
to O
bring O
the O
most O
for O
Romania B-LOC
and O
Romanian B-LOC
population O
. O

It O
is O
convenient O
exactly O
for O
these O
opportunistic O
possibilities O
that O
the O
basic O
decrees O
are O
so O
different O
and O
that O
, O
even O
more O
than O
with O
any O
other O
laws O
, O
in O
this O
case O
everything O
will O
depend O
on O
how O
the O
steps O
are O
being O
executed O
and O
on O
the O
administrative O
practice O

{ O

. O

[ O
… O
] O
I O
was O
asking O
the O
Minister O
about O
the O
current O
political O
situation O
in O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
and O
about O
the O
circumstances O
this O
situation O
depends O
on O
. O

I O
was O
very O
happy O
that O
Minister O
Djordjevič O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
me O
as O
to O
a O
diplomat O
, O
rather O
as O
to O
a O
friend O
and O
a O
person O
from O
a O
country B-LOC
he O
got O
to O
know O
and O
held O
dear O
to O
his O
heart O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
Djordjevič O
used O
to O
be O
a O
part O
of O
the O
government O
of O
Dr. B-PERS
Milan I-PERS
Stojadinović I-PERS
; O

therefore O
, O
he O
has O
been O
having O
a O
positive O
attitude O
towards O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
is O
trying O
to O
keep O
the O
best O
possible O
relationship O
with O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
Germany B-LOC
does O
not O
want O
to O
break O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
. O

Because O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
's I-LOC
economic O
unit O
represents O
a O
better O
supply O
terrain O
for O
Germany B-LOC
than O
a O
splitted O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Germany B-LOC
regards O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
as O
its O
natural O
way O
to O
the O
Adriatic B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
. O

However O
, O
Germany B-LOC
is O
not O
satisfied O
with O
the O
current O
situation O
in O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
. O

It O
is O
not O
being O
appreciated O
that O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
is O
slow O
, O
or O
even O
hesitates O
, O
to O
adapt O
to O
the O
new O
ways O
represented O
by O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
. O

The O
current O
government O
is O
not O
sympathizing O
with O
Germany B-LOC
, O
since O
it O
was O
build O
upon O
the O
premises O
which O
are O
worthless O
nowadays O
, O
after O
the O
victory O
of O
the O
National O
Socialist O
ideology O
. O

To O
explain O
further O
, O
the O
government O
conciliated O
against O
the O
politics O
of O
Milan B-PERS
Stojadinović I-PERS
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
orientate O
the O
politics O
of O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
towards O
Berlin B-LOC
and O
tried O
to O
present O
the O
country O
with O
the O
totalitarian O
regime O
. O

Today´s O
government O
stemmed O
from O
a O
democratic O
, O
pro- O
English B-LOC
and O
pro- O
French B-LOC
ideology O
, O
thus O
the O
ideology O
which O
is O
anti O
- O
German O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
government O
is O
in O
a O
latent O
crisis O
and O
therefore O
so O
much O
is O
said O
about O
its O
resignation O
. O

The O
government O
was O
to O
resign O
already O
last O
week O
. O

It O
was O
because O
of O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

Minister O
Korošec B-PERS
, O
who O
totally O
agrees O
with O
the O
politics O
of O
the O
German B-LOC
Reich I-LOC
, O
prepared O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

These O
laws O
were O
, O
however O
, O
refused O
to O
be O
enacted O
by O
some O
of O
the O
government O
members O
. O

Dr. O
Korošec B-PERS
, O
therefore O
, O
stood O
in O
the O
government O
against O
Cvetkovic B-PERS
and O
Maček B-PERS
. O

The O
dispute O
ratchet O
up O
so O
that O
Dr. O
Korošec B-PERS
and O
the O
members O
of O
the O
cabinet O
who O
are O
standing O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
new O
direction O
of O
internal O
and O
foreign O
policy O
of O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
, O
i.e O
. O
Minister O
Vulović B-PERS
, O
Pantić B-PERS
, O
Bešlić B-PERS
and O
Krek B-PERS
, O
threatened O
a O
formal O
resignation O
. O

Only O
under O
the O
threat O
of O
the O
resignation O
, O
the O
laws O
were O
approved O
. O

These O
involved O
the O
Jewish O
Quotas O
and O
the O
prohibition O
of O
the O
Jewish O
trade O
in O
life O
needs O
in O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
. O

The O
laws O
were O
published O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
said O
behind O
the O
scenes O
that O
they O
are O
to O
be O
enacted O
very O
liberally O
. O

This O
is O
where O
the O
current O
government´s O
politics O
proves O
to O
be O
two O
- O
faced O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
Yugoslavia B-LOC
is O
facing O
huge O
political O
and O
personal O
changes O
. O

Minister O
Djordjevič O
indicated O
that O
it O
might O
go O
as O
far O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

Prince B-PERS
Regent I-PERS
Pavel I-PERS
is O
a O
devoted O
anglophile O
and O
represents O
a O
regime O
which O
is O
intolerable O
to O
German B-LOC
politics O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
expected O
that O
he O
will O
be O
forced O
to O
resign O
and O
the O
reign O
will O
be O
given O
to O
King B-PERS
Peter I-PERS
II I-PERS
, O
who O
is O
to O
be O
18 O
years O
old O
only O
the O
upcoming O
year O
. O

There O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
Korošec B-PERS
will O
become O
the O
Prime O
Minister O

The O

of O

A O
strange O
commentary O
on O
life O
in O
German O
- O
occupied O
Warsaw B-LOC
is O
presented O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
many O
a O
nationalist O

has O
endeavored O
to O
take O
on O
the O
‘ O
protective O
coloration O
’ O
of O
the O
Jew O
in O
order O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
German B-ORG
police I-ORG
or O
to O
avoid O
compulsory O
labor O
. O

These O
‘ O
refugees O
’ O
have O
adopted O
Jewish O
insignia O
and O
taken O
up O
residence O
in O
the O
ghetto O
; O

many O
stories O
are O
current O
in O
Warsaw B-LOC
of O
Jews O
tearing O
off O
their O
racial O
badges O
and O
passing O
them O
over O
in O
the O
streets O
to O
fleeing O
Poles O
. O

It O
is O
noteworthy O
that O
during O
the O
period O
of O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
disturbances O
in O
Poland B-LOC
prior O
to O
German O
occupation O
the O
600,000 O
people O
in O
the O
Jewish O
district O
, O
almost O
evenly O
divided O
between O
Poles O
and O
Jews O
, O
managed O
to O
get O
along O
together O
peacefully O
and O
lived O
in O
a O
community O
spirit O
which O
was O
not O
noticeable O
in O
the O
other O
parts O

the O
city O

The O
pending O
segregation O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
an O
official O
ghetto O
affects O
an O
equal O
number O
of O
Poles O
and O
the O
move O
may O
in O
the O
long O
run O
bring O
greater O
discomfort O
to O
the O
latter O
than O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O

At O
any O
rate O
the O

may O
well O
be O
in O
a O
better O
position O
to O
maintain O
a O

to O
find O

In O
view O
of O
the O
heavy O
migration O

the O

the O

At O
the O

time O
the O
limits O
of O
the O

have O
been O
enlarged O
to O
take O
in O
certain O
additional O
blocks O

it O
is O
feared O
that O
this O

may O
mean O
the O
moving O

of O

not O
as O
yet O
resident O

It O

force O
the O

reporting O
somewhat O
similar O
measures O
in O
Rumania B-LOC

Jugoslavia B-LOC

Bulgaria B-LOC

unoccupied O

There O
appears O

, O
to O
be O
a O

carrying O
German O
anti O

beyond O

the O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
( O

authorities O
) O
strives O
for O
a O
final O
solution O
of O

Mr. O
Foreign B-PERS
minister I-PERS
, O
Through O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
National O
Radio O
Broadcasts O
, O
it O
was O
announced O
that O
, O
in O
mid O
- O
January O
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
, O
had O
been O
on O
a O
1-day O
visit O
with O
Chancellor O
Hitler B-PERS
. O

In O
Bucharest B-LOC
was O
the O
meeting O
not O
officially O
mentioned O
, O
and O
therefore O
gave O
rise O
to O
some O
remarkable O
rumours O
. O

A O
few O
days O
after O
the O
General O
’s O
return O
, O
a O
German B-ORG
General I-ORG
Staff I-ORG
Officer I-ORG
, O
Major B-PERS
Döring I-PERS
, O
was O
murdered O
on O
the O
street O
in O
Bucharest O
. O

The O
killer O
is O
said O
to O
be O
a O
man O
with O
a O
Greek B-LOC
name O
, O
Dimitrie B-PERS
Sarandos I-PERS
, O
who O
had O
come O
from O
America B-LOC
with O
a O
Turkish B-LOC
passport O
and O
whose O
profession O
is O
stated O
as O
being O
a O
wrestler O
. O

The O
cause O
of O
the O
murder O
has O
so O
far O
not O
been O
resolved O
; O

officials O
say O
that O
they O
are O
still O
investigating O
the O
crime O
. O

However O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
’s I-PERS
dismissal O
of O
the O
legionary B-ORG
Minister B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
General B-PERS
Petrovicescu I-PERS
, O
who O
was O
accused O
of O
not O
taking O
immediate O
action O
for O
a O
thorough O
investigation O
. O

The O
Legionary O
Press O
protested O
against O
this O
dismissal O
, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
emphasizing O
its O
strong O
association O
with O
the O
Axis O
Powers O
, O
calling O
for O
revenge O
on O
those O
who O
stood O
behind O
the O
killer O
. O

It O
can O
thus O
be O
concluded O
, O
that O
the O
murder O
was O
not O
aimed O
at O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Axis O
in O
Romania B-LOC
, O
as O
Romanian O
Patriots O
suggested O
it O
in O
a O
British B-LOC
Radio O
broadcasts O
, O
since O
the O
warring O
parties O
agree O
that O
only O
the O
Axis O
military O
precautions O
in O
Romania O
save O
them O
from O
further O
segregation O
between O
their O
hostile O
neighbours O
. O

One O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
Press O
controlled O
by O
the O
Legionnaires O
made O
propaganda O
for O
the O
Revolution O
, O
i.e O
. O
further O
looting O
of O
the O
possessive O
classes O
and O
especially O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
new O
members O
of O
the O
Freemasons O
. O

Finally O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
that O
he O
ruled O
with O
some O
Ministers O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
i.e O
. O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
evolutionary O
development O
, O
while O
the O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
Legionary B-ORG
Commander O
Horia B-PERS
Sima I-PERS
with O
other O
Ministers O
, O
ruled O
towards O
a O
Revolution O
and O
immediate O
looting O
and O
destruction O
of O
everything O
of O
endurance O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
unsustainable O
and O
as O
a O
first O
serious O
countermeasure O
from O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
’s O
site O
emerged O
on O
21 O
of O
this O
month O
a O
decree O
abolishing O
the O
main O
efforts O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
to O
militarize O
the O
Romanian O
institutions O
as O
well O
as O
important O
State O
enterprises O
. O

I O
have O
reported O
this O
in O
my O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

The O
answer O
to O
this O
relatively O
peaceful O
act O
was O
that O
the O
Legionary O
Party O
on O
the O
22 O
of O
this O
month O
occupied O
a O
police O
barrack O
with O
600 O
men O
, O
located O
right O
next O
to O
the O
Foreign B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
, O
where O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
has O
his O
Bureau O
as O
well O
as O
his O
temporary O
residence O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
rebellion O
had O
begun O
. O

It O
soon O
became O
clear O
that O
the O
Legionnaires O
were O
well O
supplied O
with O
rifles O
and O
ammunition O
, O
and O
that O
they O
had O
prepared O
the O
action O
by O
pre O
- O
occupying O
houses O
taken O
from O
wealthy O
Jews O
in O
all O
districts O
. O

The O
garrison O
commanded O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
, O
finally O
succeeded O
in O
capturing O
the O
Police O
barrack O
, O
from O
which O
the O
Legionnaires O
attacked O
the O
Foreign O
Ministry O
with O
the O
purpose O
of O
killing O
the O
General O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
, O
the O
military O
sought O
to O
avoid O
shooting O
and O
trusted O
the O
effect O
of O
their O
sole O
appearance O
. O

However O
, O
as O
Soldier O
everywhere O
where O
shot O
down O
, O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
second O
day O
, O
a O
common O
battle O
erupted O
throughout O
the O
city O
, O
during O
which O
the O
military O
, O
with O
guns O
, O
tanks O
and O
machine O
guns O
, O
damaged O
the O
fortified O
houses O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

There O
were O
many O
dead O
and O
wounded O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
know O
how O
many O
. O

However O
, O
the O
number O
of O
victims O
is O
hardly O
proportional O
to O
the O
periodic O
violent O
cannonade O
that O
lasted O
all O
day O
and O
night O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
days O
. O

All O
this O
time O
, O
Legionnaire O
gangs O
carried O
out O
gruesome O
pogroms O
, O
notably O
against O
the O
Jewish O
Proletariat O
in O
the O
suburbs O
, O
where O
large O
- O
scale O
assassinations O
and O
looting O
took O
place O
. O

In O
short O
, O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
so O
fiercely O
proclaimed O
Legionary B-ORG
Movement I-ORG
people O
, O
i.e O
. O

The O
dregs O
of O
the O
City O
, O
took O
the O
opportunity O
to O
show O
who O
they O
really O
were O
, O
without O
the O
so O
- O
called O
leadership O
being O
able O
to O
limit O
the O
struggle O
to O
its O
true O
purpose O
, O
which O
was O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
pure O
Legionary O
government O
under O
Horia B-PERS
Sima I-PERS
. O

Following O
the O
culmination O
of O
the O
Romanian O
Military O
’s O
efforts O
early O
on O
Thursday B-DATE
( I-DATE
the I-DATE
23rd I-DATE
) O
, O
Horia B-PERS
Sima I-PERS
sent O
out O
, O
via O
Radio O
and O
leaflets O
, O
an O
order O
to O
the O
Legionnaires O
to O
put O
down O
the O
weapons O
. O

The O
fighters O
only O
partially O
complied O
with O
the O
order O
, O
but O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
afternoon O
, O
at O
least O
, O
they O
succeeded O
in O
establishing O
peace O
while O
motorized O
divisions O
of O
the O
present O
German B-ORG
Armed I-ORG
Forces I-ORG
demonstratively O
drove O
through O
the O
city O
obviously O
prepared O
to O
assist O
the O
Romanian O
military O
if O
necessary O
. O

By O
Friday O
morning O
, O
the O
uprising O
was O
dissolved O
and O
the O
entire O
city O
occupied O
by O
the O
Romanian O
Military O
, O
which O
began O
searching O
for O
the O
Legionnaires O
’ O
hidden O
abode O
and O
large O
quantities O
of O
stolen O
goods O
distributed O
over O
many O
houses O
have O
since O
been O
brought O
to O
light O
. O

Undoubtedly O
, O
the O
entire O
Rebellion O
has O
been O
planned O
and O
staged O
by O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
’s I-PERS
closest O
Employees O
in O
the O
Legionary O
State O
’s O
leadership O
. O

The O
police B-ORG
were O
searching O
for O
Deputy O
Prime O
Minister O
Horia B-PERS
Sima I-PERS
and O
it O
is O
said O
that O
he O
has O
been O
arrested O
today O
. O

The O
appointment O
of O
a O
general O
government O
was O
generally O
expected O
, O
but O
so O
far O
, O
nothing O
has O
been O
published O
regarding O
the O
transformation O
of O
the O
government O
, O
let O
alone O
its O
dismissal O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
the O
country O
is O
currently O
administered O
solely O
the O
Governor O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
, O
currently O
administers O
the O
country O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
declared O
state O
of O
emergency O
. O

Intelligence O
from O
the O
Province O
suggests O
that O
rebellions O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
as O
here O
have O
been O
common O
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
while O
the O
rural O
population O
itself O
has O
turned O
against O
the O
plans O
of O
the O
Legionnaires O
. O

After O
the O
rebellion O
, O
General O
Antonescu B-PERS
issued O
a O
comprehensive O
Proclamation O
to O
the O
People O
. O

The O
general B-PERS
thanked O
the O
Army O
for O
its O
courage O
, O
describing O
the O
suffering O
he O
went O
through O
before O
it O
became O
inevitable O
to O
shoot O
at O
the O
people O
, O
he O
declares O
that O
from O
now O
on O
he O
will O
personally O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
youth O
’s O
education O
and O
that O
all O
who O
are O
guilty O
will O
be O
punished O
. O

General O
Disarmament O
will O
now O
be O
implemented O
by O
the O
Military O
. O

The O
Romanians O
here O
have O
stated O
to O
me O
that O
the O
proclamation O
is O
well O
suited O
to O
make O
an O
impression O
, O
especially O
within O
the O
large O
Romanian O
peasant O
population O
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
is O
found O
to O
be O
too O
lyrical O
and O
weak O
to O
deter O
future O
troublemakers O
. O

Especially O
regarding O
the O
last O
point O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
that O
the O
general B-PERS
now O
faces O
a O
number O
of O
challenges O
in O
setting O
up O
a O
new O
Ministry O
, O
but O
the O
situation O
is O
still O
too O
unclear O
to O
be O
overlooked O
. O

H.m O

King B-PERS
Mihai I-PERS
and O
the O
Royal O
family O
have O
before O
and O
during O
the O
rebellion O
period O
stayed O
in O
Sinaia B-LOC
without O
being O
directly O
involved O
in O
the O
events O

as O
far O
as O
we O
know O

Although O
wholesale O
sacking O
and O
pillaging O
were O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
, O
reports O
are O
now O
reaching O
me O
of O
appalling O
brutality O
to O
the O
Jews O
of O
Bucharest B-LOC
during O
the O
recent O
uprising O
of O
German O
and O
Communist O
inspired O
elements O
of O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
. O

The O
Turkish B-LOC
Ambassador O
’s O
estimate O
of O
two O
hundred O
eighty O
four O
Jews O
wantonly O
killed O
in O
the O
slaughter O
house O
near O
the O
Jewish O
quarter O
is O
the O
most O
conservative O
in O
numbers O
. O

He O
blamed O
primarily O
the O
savage O
Macedo O
Romanians O
, O
otherwise O
known O
as O
Kutzovlachs O
. O

But O
according O
to O
a O
reliable O
Jewish O
informant O
of O
mine O
up O
to O
yesterday O
noon O
seven O
hundred O
twenty O
- O
seven O
burial O
permits O
for O
Jews O
in O
the O
common O
grave O
in O
the O
Jewish O
cemetery O
have O
been O
applied O
for O
. O

The O
slaughter O
house O
certainly O
did O
figure O
in O
as O
much O
as O
I O
have O
it O
indirectly O
from O
an O
engineer O
working O
there O
that O
when O
he O
reported O
for O
work O
the O
next O
day O
he O
found O
sixty O
Jewish O
corpses O
on O
the O
hooks O
used O
for O
carcasses O
and O
all O
skinned O
. O

The O
quantity O
of O
blood O
about O
would O
seem O
to O
indicate O
that O
they O
had O
been O
skinned O
alive O
. O

The O
above O
estimate O
takes O
no O
account O
of O
the O
much O
larger O
number O
of O
those O
wounded O
, O
maimed O
or O
beaten O
beyond O
recognition O
by O
the O
brutes O
and O
footpads O
of O
the O
Iron B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
. O

Ignorant O
primitive O
young O
savages O
whose O
dull O
vengeful O
minds O
responded O
to O
the O
German O
- O
controlled O
and O
inspired O
Romanian O
press O
of O
repetitive O
slogans O
and O
shibboleths O
of O
Jewish O
and O
Jewish O
English B-LOC
alleged O
inimical O
evil O
doings O
. O

It O
makes O
one O
sick O
at O
heart O
to O
be O
accredited O
to O
a O
country O
where O
such O
things O
can O
happen O
even O
though O
the O
real O
faults O
of O
inspiration O
and O
encouragement O
lie O
elsewhere O
. O

It O
is O
learned O
from O
Warsaw B-LOC
that O
many O
of O
the O
Jews O
among O
the O
450,000 O
in O
the O
ghetto O
there O
are O
shortly O
to O
be O
placed O
in O

work O
on O

The O

To O

the O

that O
the O

the O
ownership O

The O

it O
is O
irrelevant O
whether O

[ O

The O
explanatory O

the O

without O

, O
Professor O
Michael B-PERS
Antonescu I-PERS
, O
states O
that O
the O
land O
ownership O
had O
always O
been O
a O
defence O
power O
against O
intruders O
in O
Romania B-LOC
. O

It O
was O
like O
that O
even O
during O
the O
Turkish B-LOC
domination O
. O

In O
19 O
th O
century O
, O
the O
codex O
Callimach O
gave O
the O
Jews O
certain O
rights O
in O
Moldova B-LOC
. O

Ever O
since O
then O
, O
the O
Jews O
slowly O
acquired O
too O
much O
of O
the O
business O
and O
industry O
as O
well O
as O
of O
the O
agricultural O
and O
residential O
estates O
thanks O
to O
the O
international O
trade O
and O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O

powers O
[ O

. O

Nowadays O
, O
the O
old O
Romanian B-LOC
ideology O
is O
valid O
again O
. O

Property O
and O
its O
national O
and O
Christian O
stratification O
are O
becoming O
an O
essential O
part O
of O
the O
new O
Romanian B-LOC
life O
. O

This O
law O
is O
not O
only O
a O
negative O
policy O
measure O
, O
but O
also O
a O
positive O
social O
and O
economic O
reform O
. O

The O
land O
that O
will O
be O
expropriated O
by O
the O
Jews O
will O
not O
become O
the O
buisness O
values O
​​that O
the O
state O
will O
give O
to O
individuals O
, O
but O
will O
become O
instruments O
for O
consolidating O
[ O
... O
] O
society O
by O
allocating O
them O
to O
the O
creative O
and O
working O
elements O
. O

With O
this O
law O
, O
a O
base O
for O
new O
life O
force O
and O
new O
creation O
of O
Romanian O
people O
will O
be O
build O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
their O
history O

their O
mental O
unity O
with O
the O
world O
of O
national O

that O
is O
emerging O
in O
the O
new O
Europe O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
add O
to O
this O
law O
that O
at O
the O
first O
glance O
it O
seems O
as O
a O
law O
very O
radically O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
, O
however O
, O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
how O
it O
will O
be O
executed O
, O
especially O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
possible O
exceptions O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
another O
important O
step O
of O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
government O
in O
the O
practical O
execution O
of O
the O
anti O

500 O

( O

possible O
, O
trying O

evocate O
sabotage O

acts O
behind O

For O
that O
reason O
there O
are O
spies O

agents O
jumping O
out O
of O

These O

Some O

The O

that O
every O

break O

be O
punished O
strictly O

I O
will O
just O
add O

it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
with O
the O
act O
against O
the O
Jews O

Jasi B-LOC
, O
the O
current O

difficult O

The O

some O
of O
the O
stern O

It O
is O
learned O
that O
the O
some O
1200 O
Jews O
removed O
from O
Stettlin B-LOC

been O
settled O
in O
three O
small O

the O

the O

by O
the O

local O
authority O

was O
responsible O
for O
the O
action O
taken O
in O
Stettin B-LOC

An O
arrangement O
has O
been O
tentatively O
concluded O
whereby O
the O
Schneidemuhl B-LOC
Jews O
will O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
Eastern O
Poland B-LOC

has O
been O
the O

The O
Department B-ORG
is O
already O
aware O
that O
the O
military O
occupation O
of O
Bessarabia B-LOC

northern O
Bucovina B-LOC
was O
followed O
by O
the O
establishment O
of O
Jews O
in O
ghettos O
in O
the O
larger O
cities O
, O
and O
that O
large O
numbers O
, O
particularly O
from O
Bessarabia B-LOC
, O
were O
gradually O
evacuated O
into O
the O
territory O
lying O
beyond O
the O
Dniester B-LOC
River I-LOC

These O
measures O
were O
carried O
out O
under O
appalling O
conditions O

accompanied O
by O
innumerable O
kinds O
of O
frightfulness O
, O
including O
robbery O
, O
starvation O

killings O

other O
brutalities O

Only O
a O
relatively O
small O
number O
of O
Jews O
are O
believed O
now O
to O
be O
left O
in O

estimates O
vary O
from O
ten O
to O
thirty O
thousand O

some O
fifteen O

twenty O
thousand O

now O
awaiting O
deportation O

A O
great O
many O
, O
undoubtedly O
tens O
of O
thousands O
, O
have O
already O
been O
thus O
evacuated O

During O
the O
past O
three O
weeks O
evidence O
has O
been O
accumulating O
– O
first O
in O
the O
form O
of O
vague O
rumors O
and O
unconfirmed O
reports O

then O
through O
increasingly O
substantial O
sources O
of O
information O

finally O
in O
exchange O
of O
letters O
between O
Marshal O
Antonescu B-PERS
and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
local O
Jewish O
community O
– O
that O
such O
as O
remains O
of O
the O
Jewish O
population O
in O
Bucovina B-LOC
and O
Bessarabia B-LOC
is O
being O
evacuated O
eastward O
into O
the O
war O
- O
devastated O
territory O
of O
the O
Ukraine B-LOC
under O
conditions O
so O
appalling O
that O
they O
would O
seem O
to O
afford O
a O
substantial O
share O
of O
the O
evacuees O
little O
chance O
to O
survive O
. O

Persistent O
reports O
have O
reached O
me O
daily O
regarding O
these O
unfortunate O
people O
– O
men O
, O
women O
and O
children O
, O
including O
the O
old O
and O
ill O
– O
who O
, O
given O
only O
a O
few O
hours O
notice O
with O
the O
right O
to O
take O
with O
them O
only O
a O
meager O
ten O
kilograms O
of O
belongings O
and O
the O
equivalent O
of O
two O
dollars O
in O
money O
– O
the O
stories O
almost O
invariably O
add O
that O
these O
belongings O
and O
the O
money O
are O
taken O
from O
them O
en O
route O
– O
have O
been O
herded O
eastward O
on O
foot O

in O

swept O
regions O
where O

razed O
and O
food O
and O
other O
supplies O
destroyed O
or O
removed O
and O
where O
winter O
weather O
will O
soon O
prevail O
. O

This O
modern O
Captivity O
would O
seem O
deliberately O
calculated O
to O
serve O
a O
program O
of O
virtual O
extermination O
and O
, O
even O
if O
the O
persistent O
rumors O
that O
the O
evacuees O
in O
numberless O

are O
plundered O
of O
their O

that O
dozens O

hundreds O

it O

Of O

as O
suggested O
in O

my O

first O
cited O

many O

The O
popular O
Rumanian O
reaction O
to O
the O
recent O
excesses O
committed O
against O
the O
Jews O
is O
difficult O
of O
assessment O

The O
Rumanians O
have O
heretofore O
insisted O
upon O
being O
known O
as O
a O
tolerant O
people O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
them O
learn O
of O
the O
massacres O
and O
other O
atrocities O
with O
, O
possibly O
, O
a O
slight O
feeling O
of O
satisfaction O
, O
mixed O
with O
a O
stronger O
sense O
of O
surprise O
, O
shock O
and O
misgiving O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
true O
that O
the O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
campaign O
of O
the O
Legionary B-ORG
régime I-ORG
, O
the O
continual O
attacks O
of O
the O

the O

Germany O

the O

of O
the O

during O
General B-PERS

absence O

Mr. B-PERS

Antonescu I-PERS

been O
Acting O

have O
all O
had O
their O
effect O
on O
popular O
opinion O
, O
tending O
to O
make O
it O
especially O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
, O
but O
I O
fail O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
country O
as O
a O
whole O
willingly O
countenances O
outright O
slaughter O
and O
brutality O
in O
the O
handling O
of O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
. O

[ O
... O

But O
the O
fact O
remains O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
popular O
uprising O
or O
movement O
against O
all O
these O
cruelties O
. O

It O
may O
well O
be O
that O
the O
ethical O
sense O
of O
the O
Rumanian O
people O
has O
been O
somewhat O
dulled O
by O
recent O
miseries O
and O
disasters O
[ O
... O
] O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
they O
are O
not O
fully O
conscious O
of O
the O
horrors O
of O
the O
Jewish O
phase O
. O

Whatever O
the O
cause O
, O
1941 O
has O
thus O
far O
proved O
to O
be O
a O
black O
year O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
Rumania B-LOC

My O
own O
experience O
is O
that O
the O
better O
class O
of O
Rumanians O
thoroughly O
disapproves O
of O
the O
methods O
resorted O
to O
from O
time O
to O

against O
the O

the O
cruelty O

the O

[ O

The O
fact O
remains O

however O
, O
that O
the O
lower O

The O

although O
it O
is O
largely O
due O
to O
his O
own O
laissez O

Mach B-PERS
told O

not O

had O
simply O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O

the O
President B-PERS

has O
done O
his O
utmost O
to O
mitigate O
the O
harshness O
of O
the O

made O
use O
, O
despite O
a O
strong O
opposition O

the O

himself O

of O
the O
right O

if O

has O
even O
prevented O
a O

all O

two O
critical O

the O

, O
this O
is O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
finds O
himself O
unable O
to O
oppose O
the O

It O
is O

far O
one O
of O
the O

that O
the O

I O
was O
therefore O
struck O
yesterday O
when O
my O
Turkish O
colleague O
called O
to O
say O
that O
he O
had O
strongly O
urged O
by O

the O
desirability O
of O
conferring O

the O
British O

out O
of O

with O
the O
French O

to O
see O
whether O
there O
was O
not O
some O
way O
to O
arrange O
temporary O
lodgings O
in O
barracks O
in O
Syria B-LOC
or O
Palestine B-LOC
for O
the O
unfortunate O
Jews O
still O
left O
in O
Romania B-LOC

[ O
... O
] O
I O
am O
wholly O
in O
accord O
with O
his O
proposal O
which O
, O
if O
adopted O
, O
might O
save O
many O
innocent O
lives O
and O
spare O
extreme O
human O
suffering O
. O

I O
have O
no O
illusions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Romanians O
will O
ever O
let O
these O
poor O

out O

The O
law O
- O
decree O
of O
30th B-DATE
April I-DATE

must O
be O
considered O
together O
with O
the O
other O
decree O
instituting O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
which O
delivers O
opinions O
and O
offers O
suggestions O

all O
cases O

which O
the O
racial O
status O
is O
in O

, O
On O
the O
Protection O

Honour O
of O
the O
Croatian O
People O

which O
absolutely O
forbids O

Jews O
or O
persons O
not O
belonging O

the O
Aryan O

persons O

In O
addition O
to O
these O
legislative O
measures O
there O
is O
also O
a O
body O
of O
police O
regulations O
concerning O
Jews O
, O
the O
main O
being O
: O

Jews O
are O
banned O
from O
living O
in O
certain O
parts O
of O
town O
their O
personal O
property O
is O
confiscated O

they O
are O
forbidden O
to O
keep O
radios O

telephones O
male O
Jews O
aged O
from O
16 O
to O
60 O
must O
have O
themselves O
entered O
in O
special O
registers O
they O
must O
all O
, O
irrespective O
of O
age O

wear O
a O
special O
badge O
on O
the O

and O
may O
only O
pass O
through O
they O
are O
banned O
from O
entering O
public O
establishments O
, O
etc. O
Having O
thus O
determined O
the O
legal O
status O
of O
persons O
belonging O
to O
the O
Jewish O
race O
, O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
settle O
all O
attendant O
economic O
matters O
. O

A O
first O
step O
was O
therefore O
to O
declare O
null O
and O
void O
all O
contracts O
entered O
into O
between O
Jews O
and O
between O
Jews O
and O
others O
in O
the O
60 O
days O
preceding O
the O
declaration O
of O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia B-LOC
, O
if O
the O
value O
of O
the O
contract O
was O
over O
100,000 O
Dinars O
and O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
subsequently O
approved O
by O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Justice O
. O

Almost O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
law O
- O
decree O
was O
issued O
whereby O
all O
businesses O
that O
were O
entirely O
or O
partially O
owned O
by O
Jews O
as O
well O
as O
those O
in O
which O
one O
or O
more O
Jews O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
Board O
of O
Directors O
or O
had O
managerial O
posts O
were O
considered O
Jewish O
. O

That O
same O
decree O
ordered O
Jews O
, O
persons O
of O
Aryan O
origin O
joined O
in O
matrimony O
with O
Jews O
, O
foreign O
Jews O
who O
were O
on O
Croatian O
territory O
as O
of O
5th B-DATE
June I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
and O
Jewish O
businesses O
to O
report O
their O
assets O
as O
well O
as O
all O
changes O
of O
ownership O
that O
had O
occurred O
after O
10th B-DATE
February I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
. O

With O
this O
decree O
any O
alienation O
of O
Jewish O
property O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
transfer O
of O
Jewish O
businesses O
, O
of O
stocks O
, O
of O
shares O
in O
consortia O
and O
other O
property O
rights O
was O
made O
impossible O
, O
since O
any O
contract O
of O
whatever O
kind O
required O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
. O

Jewish O
businesses O
thus O
confiscated O
by O
the O
State O
might O
be O
managed O
by O
the O
State O
itself O
, O
or O
be O
either O
leased O
, O
sold O
or O
liquidated O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
Treasury O

The O
final O
decision O
in O
all O
these O
cases O
lies O
with O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
National I-ORG
Economy I-ORG
. O

Lastly O
, O
with O
the O
Decree O
of O
10th B-DATE
October I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
authority O
on O
all O
matters O
concerning O
the O
estates O
of O
individual O
Jews O
or O
of O
Jewish O
businesses O
has O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
which O
may O
, O
with O
a O
discretionary O
decision O
that O
admits O
no O
recourse O
, O
nationalize O
the O
assets O
of O
any O
Jew O
as O
well O
as O
of O
any O
Jewish O
business O
and O
determine O
what O
compensation O
, O
if O
any O
, O
shall O
be O
paid O
and O
how O
. O

The O
estates O
thus O
acquired O
can O
be O
assigned O
to O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
or O
to O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
. O

Recently O
this O
Department O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Political O
Commission O
on O
Race O
, O
have O
been O
eliminated O
and O
all O
authority O
in O
matters O
concerning O
Jewish O
economic O
questions O
and O
the O
assessment O
of O
race O
has O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
Office O
for O
Nationalized O
Assets O
, O
and O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Interior O
Affairs O
respectively O
. O

The O
implementation O
of O
all O
these O
measures O
has O
not O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
been O
very O
easy O
. O

Croatian O
public O
opinion O
, O
being O
insufficiently O
prepared O
for O
a O
racial O
campaign O
and O
still O
wary O
of O
the O
new O
Regime O
, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
shaken O
by O
a O
string O
of O
illegal O
acts O
carried O
out O
by O
unscrupulous O
Ustashe O
officials O
, O
had O
a O
rather O
negative O
reaction O
against O
these O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
measures O
and O
watched O
the O
course O
of O
events O
with O
great O
scepticism O
. O

From O
a O
technical O
point O
of O
view O
, O
moreover O
, O
the O
State O
Department O
for O
Reconstruction O
, O
which O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
the O
buttress O
of O
the O
entire O
system O
, O
and O
whose O
task O
it O
was O
basically O
to O
centralize O
and O
draw O
up O
an O
inventory O
of O
all O
Jewish O
property O
, O
proved O
decidedly O
inferior O
to O
the O
task O
they O
had O
been O
entrusted O
with O
, O
both O
because O
their O
offices O
were O
disorganized O
and O
because O
its O
officials O
had O
absolutely O
no O
experience O
in O
such O
matters O
. O

This O
state O
of O
affairs O
was O
taken O
advantage O
of O
by O
elements O
of O
the O
German O
ethnic O
group O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
who O
, O
through O
their O
financial O
organizations O
, O
were O
able O
to O
acquire O
legally O
the O
main O
formerly O
Jewish O
businesses O
. O

Lastly O
, O
as O
to O
the O
present O
situation O
of O
Croats O
who O
own O
formerly O
Jewish O
property O
, O
it O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
they O
have O
acquired O
it O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
but O
mainly O
through O
a O
system O
of O
fictitious O
sales O
carried O
out O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
persons O
appointed O
by O
the O
State O
to O
the O
task O
of O
managing O
said O
property O
. O

Of O
the O
40,000 O
Jews O
who O
, O
it O
has O
been O
estimated O
, O
were O
living O
in O
Croatian O
territory O
, O
only O
approx O
. O
6,000 O
are O
left O
, O
almost O
all O
interned O
in O
concentration O
camps O
or O
assigned O
to O
farm O
work O
or O
to O
land O
reclamation O
. O

Of O
the O
rest O
, O
some O
have O
managed O
to O
emigrate O
and O
some O
must O
be O
considered O
missing O
. O

The O
Jewish O
problem O
can O
therefore O
be O
considered O
virtually O
solved O
in O
the O
Independent O
State O
of O
Croatia O
; O

a O
few O
issues O
still O
remain O
pending O
, O
such O
for O
instance O
as O
mixed O
marriages O
, O
but O
they O
too O
will O
soon O
be O
dealt O
with O
and O
settled O
. O

Measures O

- O
The O
new O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
that O
had O
been O
announced O
have O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
seen O
a O
drastic O
implementation O
. O

Ten O
thousand O
Jews O
in O
towns O
and O
in O
villages O
had O
received O
personal O
summonses O
in O
order O
to O
be O
assembled O
in O
concentration O
camps O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
one O
may O
convert O
to O
the O
evangelical O
Church O
and O
because O
many O
of O
those O
summoned O
were O
aware O
that O
public O
opinion O
was O
mostly O
opposed O
to O
the O
anti O
- O
Semitic O
campaign O
, O
and O
also O
because O
rumour O
had O
it O
that O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Republic B-LOC
, O
Monsignor O
Tiso B-PERS
, O
was O
indirectly O
opposed O
to O
such O
methods O
of O
persecution O
, O
many O
Jews O
did O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
orders O
given O
by O
Minister B-PERS
Mach I-PERS

So O
in O
the O
night O
from O
23rd O
to O
24th O
March O
patrols O
formed O
by O
police O
and O
Guardsmen O
who O

been O
joined O
by O
SS O
men O
arrived O
from O
over O
the O
nearby O
border O
, O
entered O
Jewish O
homes O
, O
seized O
three O
thousand O
women O
aged O
18 O
to O
35 O
years O
, O
and O
carried O
them O
swiftly O
on O
a O

to O
the O

to O
the O
internment O

The O
Authorities O

denying O
or O
trying O
to O
downplay O
the O
extent O

everything O

It O
is O

the O
Minister O

who O
is O
entirely O
subservient O
to O
the O
orders O
from O

the O

intends O
to O
gradually O
carry O
out O
the O
concentration O

mass O
deportation O
of O
all O

that O

However O
, O
since O

This O

the O
various O

on O
individual O
aspects O
of O
the O

the O

However O
, O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
now O
again O
surfaces O
on O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
political O
scene O
has O
changed O
deeply O
since O
the O
day O
when O
Hungary B-LOC

linking O
its O

to O
that O
of O
the O

necessarily O
had O
to O

even O
in O
its O
interior O

, O
with O
many O
hesitations O
and O
many O
formal O

Herein O
lies O
precisely O
the O
interest O
that O
the O
Jewish O

continues O
to O
attract O
after O
the O
emphatic O

formally O

We O
will O
not O
desist O
from O
the O
struggle O
– O
said O
Kállay O
– O
until O
with O
a O
systematic O
and O
ever O
increasing O
pace O
we O
have O
taken O
away O
from O
the O
Jews O
every O
sector O
of O
national O

and O
we O
have O
at O

entirely O
removed O
them O

In O
order O
to O
appreciate O
the O
significance O

these O
words O
and O
to O
understand O
the O
complexity O
of O
the O
situation O
to O
which O
they O
refer O

be O

Among O
the O
other O
misfortunes O
which O
befell O
this O

at O
the O
time O
of O
the O

also O
the O

Jews O
who O
found O
a O
favourable O
situation O
under O

The O

severe O

the O

which O
rules O
that O
as O
from O
that O
date O
the O
Jewish O
persuasion O
ceases O
to O
be O
officially O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
state I-LOC
. O

Some O
facts O
emerge O
from O
what O
has O
been O
said O
here O
that O
place O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jewish O
problem O
in O
its O
true O
perspective O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
the O
main O
factor O
that O
encouraged O
the O
Jewish O
invasion O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
and O
is O
still O
far O
from O
having O
vanished O
needs O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
absence O
, O
in O
the O
social O
structure O
of O
this O
Country O
, O
of O
an O
urban O
middle O
class O
that O
might O
carry O
out O
the O
functions O
and O
the O
tasks O
that O
have O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Jews O
. O

This O
explains O
why O
it O
is O
fairly O
easy O
to O
implement O
the O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
law O
in O
the O
countryside O
, O
where O
the O
aristocracy O
and O
the O
landed O
middle O
classes O
are O
still O
active O
and O
significant O
forces O
, O
whereas O
it O
remains O
difficult O
to O
do O
the O
same O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
particularly O
in O
Budapest B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
immediate O
removal O
, O
supposing O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
carry O
it O
out O
, O
of O
all O
Jews O
holding O
managing O
posts O
in O
industry O
, O
commerce O
and O
banks O
would O
cause O
a O
crisis O
that O
would O
overwhelm O
the O
Hungarian O
economy O
. O

Only O
by O
gradually O
and O
simultaneously O
inserting O
Hungarian B-LOC
elements O
that O
are O
capable O
of O
occupying O
the O
posts O
at O
present O
held O
by O
Jews O
will O
Hungary B-LOC
be O
able O
to O
face O
the O
actual O
expulsions O
of O
the O
latter O
from O
the O
most O
vital O
hubs O
of O
its O
economic O
structure O
. O

This O
necessity O
highlights O
another O
delicate O
aspect O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

As O
long O
as O
it O
is O
not O
able O
to O
replace O
them O
, O
Hungary B-LOC
cannot O
do O
without O
the O
, O
albeit O
limited O
, O
cooperation O
of O
the O
Jews O
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
cannot O
be O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
state O
of O
mind O
of O
this O
by O
no O
means O
insignificant O
part O
of O
its O
population O
and O
as O
to O
the O
influence O
it O
has O
on O
public O
opinion O
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
since O
an O
immediate O
and O
complete O
solution O
of O
the O
problem O
looks O
impossible O
, O
the O
Hungarian O
Government O
intends O
to O
continue O
to O
keep O
the O
Jewish O
question O
alive O
and O
open O
; O

its O
final O
conclusion O
, O
as O
President O
Kalláy B-PERS
said O
in O
his O
latest O
speech O
, O
will O
be O
removal O
outside O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
of O
all O
the O
800,000 O
Jews O
living O
in O
the O
Country O
. O

As O
I O
already O
said O
, O
the O
numerous O
mixed O
marriages O
entered O
into O
by O
the O
Jews O
served O
them O
well O
in O
strengthening O
their O
position O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
ignored O
that O
in O
joining O
their O
power O
to O
that O
of O
many O
aristocratic O
and O
middle O
class O
families O
, O
the O
Jews O
of O
Hungary B-LOC
have O
created O
a O
network O
of O
shared O
interests O
and O
of O
solidarity O
with O
the O
very O
social O
classes O
that O
ought O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

And O
they O
have O
contributed O
not O
a O
little O
to O
the O
spreading O
of O
the O
liberal O
ideology O
, O
which O
in O
this O
Country O
is O
perhaps O
more O
enduring O
than O
in O
others O
. O

The O
solution O
of O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
therefore O
poses O
for O
Hungary B-LOC
a O
distressful O
and O
difficult O
problem O
as O
it O
closely O
concerns O
its O
social O
structure O
and O
its O
economic O
organization O
, O
and O
this O
, O
moreover O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
Country O
needs O
all O
its O
energies O
to O
face O
its O
new O
and O
important O
tasks O
. O

This O
explains O
the O
hesitancy O
apparent O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
action O
and O
a O
certain O
scepticism O
displayed O
even O
today O
by O
many O
towards O
the O
effectiveness O
and O
even O
towards O
the O
sincerity O
of O
the O
Government O
’s O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
policies O
, O
But O
the O
Government O
’s O
will O
to O
advance O
on O
the O
road O
it O
has O
in O
part O
already O
covered O
does O
not O
appear O
in O
doubt O
and O
it O
may O
not O
be O
unnecessary O
to O
point O
out O
that O
considerations O
and O
influences O
of O
an O
international O
nature O
are O
not O
without O
bearing O
on O
this O

previous O

, O
regarding O
the O
Treatment O
of O
Jewish O
Wealth O

the O
State O
Commission O

Ostland O
. O

The O
Area O
Commissioners O
or O
the O
Self- O
Government O
administrative O
Authorities O
have O
drafted O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
provisions O
, O
and O
many O
of O
these O
Provisions O
are O
hardly O
published O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
regulations O
in O
question O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
access O
for O
the O
legation O
, O
and O
there O
may O
also O
be O
some O
minor O
differences O
in O
the O
rules O
at O
the O
various O
locations O
. O

In O
the O
following O
, O
the O
legation O
will O
refer O
to O
some O
of O
the O
special O
provisions O
applicable O
to O
the O
Jews O
of O
Ostland O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
foregoing O
, O
it O
is O
not O
certain O
that O
all O
the O
rules O
made O
under O
B. O
IV O
to O
VII O
apply O
throughout O
Ostland O
. O

However O
, O
the O
envoy O
has O
intended O
to O
refrain O
from O
conducting O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
they O
are O
applicable O
everywhere O
, O
as O
their O
applicability O
in O
most O
places O
is O
undoubted O
, O
and O
it O
is O
probably O
more O
the O
general O
principles O
which O
have O
been O
adopted O
by O
the O
authorities O
. O

The O
following O
draws O
upon O
some O
of O
the O
Special O
Provisions O
of O
Interest O
. O

A. O
So O
far O
there O
is O
no O
provision O
for O
what O
is O
meant O
by O
the O
term O
' O
Jew O
' O
. O

However O
, O
one O
would O
assume O
that O
the O
rules O
of O
this O
term O
in O
Ostland O
, O
are O
similar O
to O
the O
ones O
used O
in O
Germany O

the O
Ministry O

Foreign O
Affairs O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
it O
should O
not O
make O
Jews O
into O
a O
question O
. O

Since O
then O
in O
many O
countries O
in O
Europe B-LOC
persecution O
of O
Jews O
has O
worsened O
. O

Recently O
, O
it O
is O
the O
same O
even O
in O
France B-LOC
, O
which O
has O
been O
considered O
their O
paradise O
/ O
haven O
. O

Therefore O
, O
when O
the O
war O
is O
over O
, O
many O
of O
the O
Jews O
will O
leave O
Europe B-LOC
and O
in O
that O
case O
we O
should O
pay O
attention O
so O
that O
they O
don’t O
flow O
into O
Greater O
East O
Asia O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
while O
building O
Greater O
East O
Asia O
, O
from O
now O
on O
we O
need O
to O
diligently O
pay O
close O
attention O
so O
as O
to O
eliminate O
the O
Jewish O
influence O
entrenched O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
East O
Asia O
starting O
from O
Shanghai B-LOC
to O
the O
extent O
possible O
and O
to O
eradicate O
their O
foundation O
. O

At O
the O
present O
they O
are O
bound O
to O
engage O
in O
Fifth O
Column O
type O
of O

for O
the O

so O
we O

all O

Confidential O
! O

The O
Minister B-PERS
of I-PERS
Interior I-PERS
has O
published O
a O
decree O
about O
Jews O
today O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
decree O
, O
the O
authorities O
discovered O
that O
the O
most O
of O
the O
offenses O
against O
the O
laws O
and O
economical O
decrees O
of O
Warfare O
, O
together O
with O
the O
most O
of O
the O
sabotage O
acts O
and O
speculations O
, O
such O
as O
accumulation O
of O
medicaments O
, O
substances O
, O
wool O
, O
cotton O
, O
food O
, O
etc. O
, O
are O
being O
committed O
by O
the O
Jews O
themselves O
. O

It O
was O
also O
discovered O
that O
many O
of O
the O
Jews O
are O
skipping O
their O
obligatory O
work O
tasks O
and O
are O
trying O
to O
ensure O
their O
existence O
by O
illegal O
speculations O
or O
are O
carrying O
out O
a O
subversive O
propaganda O
. O

Based O
on O
these O
findings O
, O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Inferior O
has O
decided O
to O
execute O
house O
searches O
. O

Jews O
who O
have O
been O
found O
to O
have O
accumulated O
supplies O
, O
or O
have O
evaded O
work O
, O
committed O
sabotage O
, O
or O
who O
are O
refugees O
from O
Bukovina B-LOC
and O
Besarabia B-LOC
will O
be O
deported O
with O
their O
families O
to O
areas O
east O
of O
the O
Bug B-LOC
River I-LOC
and O
the O
goods O
found O
will O
be O
. O

Similar O
faith O
awaits O
those O
Jews O
who O
will O
leave O
their O
villages O
without O
an O
approval O
, O
who O
skipped O
various O
legal O
dispositions O
for O
religious O
reasons O
or O
those O
who O
will O
make O
any O
offenses O
against O
the O
economic O
order O
or O
against O
the O
state O
safety O
. O

I O
will O
just O
add O
to O
this O
, O
that O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
local O
Jews O
is O
intensifying O
, O
since O
the O
notice O
gives O
the O
authorities O
the O
right O
to O
deport O
any O
of O
the O
Jews O
to O
the O
Russian B-LOC
area O
across O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

After O
the O
almost O
complete O
Aryanization O
of O
the O
industries O
, O
the O
local O
Jews O
currently O
earn O
their O
living O
almost O
exclusively O
from O
types O
of O
businesses O
which O
violate O
the O
economic O
laws O
and O
orders O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
reason O
to O
accuse O
many O
Jews O
of O
sabotage O
. O

A O
similar O
reason O
theoretically O
applies O
to O
household O
supplying O
. O

While O
it O
is O
true O
that O
after O
the O
publication O
of O
this O
decree O
, O
the O
stock O
will O
disappear O
from O
Jewish O
households O
, O
there O
is O
not O
a O
single O
Christian O
household O
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
without O
large O
supply O
of O
food O
and O
other O
necessities O
, O
since O
these O
families O
do O
not O
and O
partially O
even O
cannot O
live O
only O
from O
the O
small O
allowances O
. O

Re O
: O

Treatment O
of O
Jews O
As O
this O
Royal O
Legation O
reported O
in O
the O
telegram O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
transfer O
to O
Poland B-LOC
of O
the O
Jewish O
survivors O
left O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
is O
currently O
under O
way O
. O

The O
transfer O
is O
carried O
out O
with O
special O
trains O
provided O
by O
Croatian B-LOC
authorities O
, O
who O
, O
besides O
equipping O
the O
people O
who O
are O
leaving O
, O
are O
also O
required O
to O
pay O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Reich O
30 O
Mark O
per O
person O
. O

( O
Initially O
the O
Reich O
had O
requested O
500 O
Mark O
) O
. O

The O
said O
measures O
have O
led O
to O
a O
démarche O
– O
as O
the O
Poglavnik B-PERS
himself O
has O
confirmed O
– O
by O
the O
Apostolic O
Delegate O
here O
, O
which O
brought O
no O
conclusive O
results O
. O

It O
seems O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
category O
formed O
by O
Aryans O
joined O
in O
matrimony O
to O
Jews O
will O
be O
left O
alone O
. O

The O
Minister O
of O
Germany O
here O
, O
in O
a O
conversation O
he O
had O
with O
the O
R. O
Minister O
about O
various O
issues O
, O
hinted O
at O
the O
advisability O
of O
starting O
to O
remove O
also O
the O
Jews O
who O
have O
sought O
shelter O
in O
the O
2nd O
zone O
occupied O
by O
Italian B-LOC
troops O
and O
asked O
how O
many O
there O
might O
be O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the O
larger O
groups O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
is O
was O
aware O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
in O
Mostar B-LOC
, O
in O
Ragusa B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Dubrovnik I-LOC
] I-LOC
and O
in O
Cirquenizza B-LOC
[ I-LOC
Crikvenica I-LOC
] I-LOC
. O

Lastly O
, O
he O
hinted O
at O
an O
official O
step O
that O
the O
Government O
of O
the O
Reich O
is O
about O
to O
make O
in O
order O
to O
request O
that O
these O
Jews O
, O
like O
the O
others O
in O
Croatia B-LOC
, O
be O
also O
sent O
to O

Giustiniani B-PERS
Dear O
Hans B-PERS
Jakob I-PERS
Hansen I-PERS

Thank O

17.E. O

, O
concerning O
Mrs. O
Martha O
Hagen O
. O

I O
understand O
, O
that O
in O
Danish B-LOC
circles O
, O
where O
the O
German B-LOC
attitude O
to O
the O
Jewish O
question O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
, O
we O
can O
be O
somewhat O
disappointed O
with O
the O
weak O
results O
in O
these O
cases O
and O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
we O
are O
too O
reluctant O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
envoy O
and O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
like O
to O
try O
, O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
a O
letter O
, O
to O
redress O
our O
difficulties O
. O

The O
official O
German O
attitude O
towards O
the O
Jews O
gradually O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
severe O
as O
the O
war O
progresses O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
seen O
as O
the O
enemies O
of O
the O
People O
and O
they O
want O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
, O
at O
best O
through O
isolation O
in O
ghettos O
in O
the O
designated O
areas O
. O

This O
attitude O
applies O
to O
the O
Jews O
as O
a O
race O
without O
regard O
to O
citizenship O
, O
and O
the O
goal O
is O
the O
introduction O
of O
a O
Jewish O
law O
similar O
to O
the O
German O
throughout O
Europe B-LOC
, O
that O
is O
, O
also O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
foreign O
Jews O
in O
Germany O
are O
spared O
some O
of O
the O
most O
rigorous O
provisions O
, O
but O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
even O
non O
- O
German O
Jews O
, O
in O
due O
course O
, O
must O
be O
anti O
- O
nationalsocialist O
. O

Both O
German O
and O
foreign O
Jews O
were O
generally O
allowed O
to O
travel O
earlier O
- O
so O
they O
could O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
- O
, O
but O
as O
the O
war O
progressed O
, O
another O
consideration O
became O
more O
and O
more O
applicable O
: O

The O
fear O
of O
information O
about O
conditions O
in O
this O
country O
being O
spread O
across O
the O
world O
, O
which O
could O
damage O
Germany O
's O
position O
and O
bring O
substance O
to O
the O
anti- O
nationalsocialist O
propaganda O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
preferable O
not O
to O
see O
too O
much O
traffic O
across O
the O
borders O
, O
by O
persons O
who O
are O
not O
considered O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
reliable O
politically O
– O
apart O
from O
the O
difficulties O
of O
permits O
for O
entry O
and O
exit O
in O
general O
- O
and O
for O
the O
Jews O
, O
who O
are O
all O
considered O
100%-unreliable O
, O
we O
now O
see O
an O
almost O
completely O
shut O
down O
. O

While O
there O
are O
still O
exceptions O
made O
for O
foreign O
Jews O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
possible O
for O
German O
Jews O
to O
travel O
, O
even O
if O
they O
have O
acquired O
foreign O
citizenship O
by O
marriage O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
marriage O
took O
place O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
Jewish O
law O
, O
which O
is O
the O
case O
both O
with O
the O
married O
couple O
Hagen O
and O
with O
marriage O
of O
Thomsen O
in O
Schøn O
’s O
letter O
of O

August I-DATE
to O
Ryder O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
first O
few O
years O
after O
the O
introduction O
of O
Jewish O
laws O
, O
several O
female O
German O
Jews O
married O
foreigners O
. O

The O
German O
authorities O
regard O
all O
these O
marriages O
as O
concluded O
solely O
for O
trying O
to O
circumvent O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
, O
the O
motives O
behind O
the O
marriages O
are O
self O
- O
evident O
( O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
does O
not O
preclude O
the O
man O
from O
acting O
on O
the O
noblest O
and O
most O
humane O
motives O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
according O
to O
German O
opinion O
, O
mixing O
Aryan O
and O
Jewish O
blood O
is O
a O
crime O
, O
and O
that O
marriages O
between O
Aryans O
and O
Jews O
are O
forbidden O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
believe O
that O
we O
are O
wise O
to O
leave O
these O
cases O
as O
hopeless O
and O
save O
the O
very O
poor O
‘ O
goodwill O
’ O
we O
have O
for O
cases O
about O
Danish B-LOC
Jews O
with O
Connection O
to O
Denmark B-LOC
. O

Even O
for O
their O
part O
, O
it O
can O
be O
difficult O
, O
since O
the O
German O
side O
expects O
that O
the O
government O
of O
a O
neighbouring O
country O
shows O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
German O
attitude O

Affairs I-ORG
regarding O
Articles O
in O
the O
' O
Kamptegnet O
' O
, O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
very O
illustrative O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
you O
suggest O
allowing O
the O
Consulate O
General O
to O
go O
to O
the O
police O
has O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
great O
caution O
. O

In O
several O
cases O
, O
the O
police O
have O
rejected O
such O
requests O
from O
the O
Consulate O
General O
and O
wanted O
the O
issue O
to O
go O
the O
diplomatic O
way O
. O

We O
have O
also O
seen O
that O
the O
police O
authorities O
have O
said O
to O
the O
Consulate O
General O
that O
they O
would O
have O
to O
look O
after O
the O
person O
if O
she O
continued O
to O
bother O
them O
with O
applications O
. O

We O
hereby O
reach O
a O
point O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
hasn’t O
had O
much O
attention O
at O
home O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
persons O
seeking O
our O
and O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
` I-ORG
assistance O
have O
tried O
all O
possible O
ways O
. O

The O
result O
easily O
becomes O
an O
Irritation O
to O
the O
Authorities O
, O
which O
may O
cause O
fatal O
consequences O
for O
the O
persons O
concerned O
. O

There O
is O
a O
risk O
that O
the O
authorities O
, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
more O
nonsense O
, O
will O
send O
those O
concerned O
to O
the O
General O
Government O
or O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
the O
risk O
of O
1 O
) O
that O
the O
relatively O
gentle O
treatment O
of O
foreign O
Jews O
in O
part O
is O
replaced O
by O
a O
sharper O
course O
and O
2 O
) O
that O
the O
question O
of O
precautionary O
measures O
against O
Jews O
in O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
relevant O
. O

After O
all O
, O
it O
is O
of O
no O
use O
that O
Denmark B-LOC
becomes O
more O
famous O
than O
most O
necessary O
as O
a O
Jewish O
sanctuary O
. O

I O
, O
therefore O
, O
allow O
you O
to O
recommend O
that O
you O
explain O
to O
Mr. O
Hagen O
, O
that O
by O
pushing O
more O

New O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
seem O
determined O
to O
solve O
the O
Jewish O
problem O
with O
drastic O
measures O
, O
sending O
a O
great O
number O
of O
Semtic O
elements O
to O
the O
occupied O
Russian B-LOC
territories O
. O

These O
deportations O
had O
already O
started O
during O
last O
winter O
and O
involved O
the O
Jews O
living O
in O
Bessarabia B-LOC
and O
Bukovina B-LOC
, O
who O
were O
accused O
of O
having O
welcomed O
the O
Bolshevik O
occupation O
, O
and O
those O
in O
Moldavia B-LOC
, O
who O
during O
the O
first O
days O
of O
the O
war O
had O
stirred O
up O
Communist O
riots O
in O
Jassy B-LOC
and O
in O
Galatz B-LOC
that O
were O
immediately O
suppressed O
. O

The O
system O
now O
has O
been O
extended O
to O
other O
regions O
and O
towns O
, O
including O
the O
capital B-LOC
, O
where O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
the O
police O
have O
carried O
out O
vast O
round O
- O
ups O
among O
the O
Jewish O
element O
and O
have O
sent O
the O
people O
arrested O
beyond O
the O
Dnestr B-LOC
and O
beyond O
the O
Bug B-LOC
. O

There O
they O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
, O
mainly O
road O
works O
, O
but O
reportedly O
last O
winter O
many O
, O
due O
also O
to O
lack O
of O
equipment O
and O
of O
suitable O
lodgings O
, O
did O
not O
survive O
the O
long O
marches O
from O
one O
place O
to O
the O
other O
and O
the O
rigours O
of O
the O
Russian B-LOC
winter O
. O

News O
of O
these O
measures O
spread O
rapidly O
even O
abroad O
, O
causing O
the O
United B-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
send O
a O
protest O
note O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Legation I-ORG
which O
here O
protects O
their O
interests O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Romanian B-LOC
government O
, O
during O
the O
last O
meeting O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Ministers O
, O
decided O
to O
ignore O
the O
American O
démarche O
and O
to O
carry O
on O
with O
the O
deportations O
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
the O
Jews O
to O
be O
sent O
beyond O
the O
Dniestr B-LOC
have O
been O
classed O
– O
according O
to O
a O
list O
that O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
have O
handed O
to O
German B-ORG
authorities I-ORG
on O
their O

The O

in O

opinion O

the O

which O
the O
Conducator B-PERS

which O
never O

urge O
Romanians B-LOC
to O
use O
forcefulness O

at O

time O
will O

In O
the O

the O
anti O

measures O
are O
designed O
instead O
to O
do O
away O

is O
a O
Catholic O
and O
has O
been O
such O
for O
thirty O
- O
five O
years O
. O

He O
declared O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
his O
severe O
treatment O
is O
the O
jealousy O
of O
Bulgarian O
surgeons O
and O
doctors O
who O
take O
this O
means O
of O
ridding O
themselves O
of O
competition O
. O

As O
has O
already O
been O
mentioned O
several O
thousand O
Jews O
are O
now O
in O
the O
process O
of O
being O
deported O
from O
Sofia B-LOC
. O

Where O
they O
will O
be O
sent O
is O
not O
known O
. O

They O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
deported O
to O
towns O
and O
villages O
in O
Bulgaria B-LOC
but O
some O
high O
placed O
persons O
believe O
many O
of O
them O
will O
be O
deported O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Some O
think O
they O
will O
be O
put O
in O
concentration O
camps O
inside O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
where O
many O
will O
eventually O
die O
of O
disease O
and O
starvation O
. O

Others O
, O
including O
the O
surgeon O
referred O
to O
above O
, O
think O
that O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
them O
will O
be O
shot O
, O
as O
they O
have O
been O
in O
Belgrade B-LOC
and O
other O
cities O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
the O
content O
of O
the O
law O
, O
together O
with O
the O
severity O
with O
which O
it O
is O
being O
enforced O
show O
that O
its O
purpose O
is O
the O
complete O
destruction O
of O
the O
Jewish O
community O
in O

[ O

It O
is O
believed O
likely O
that O
many O
of O
these O
Jews O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
occupied O
Russian B-LOC
territory O
for O
manual O
labor O
as O
has O
been O
the O
case O
with O
Jews O
from O
other O
Danubian O
countries O
. O

The O
eventual O
repatriation O
of O
Jews O
deported O
to O
the O
East O
would O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
envisaged O
by O
the O
present O
Hungarian O
Government O
which O
has O
recently O
intensified O
under O
Nazi O
inspiration O
its O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
program O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
anti O
- O
semitic O
measures O
are O
becoming O
more O
stringent O
in O
administration O
and O
that O
anti O
- O
semitic O
propaganda O
increases O
upon O
the O
eastern O
front O
. O

This O
activity O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
encouraged O
by O
those O
Romanians O
who O
have O
benefited O
from O
the O
confiscations O
of O
Jewish O
property O
and O
their O
forced O
retirement O
from O
Romanian O
public O
life O

[ O

The O
question O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Romania B-LOC
and O
the O
war O
against O
Soviet O
Russia O
are O
linked O
together O
, O
as O
in O
all O
Axis O
States O
. O

This O
attitude O
is O
claimed O
by O
competent O
observers O
to O
be O
greatly O
encouraged O
by O
the O
Romanian O
aristocrats O
, O
business O
and O
professional O
men O
, O
who O
are O
behind O
the O
Government O
in O
this O
attempt O
. O

The O
explanation O
offered O
for O
the O
support O
of O
these O
classes O
to O
anti O
- O
semitic O
propaganda O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
are O
the O
chief O
beneficiaries O
of O
the O
expropriations O
of O
Jewish O
owned O
properties O
in O
Romania B-LOC
and O
that O
the O
control O
of O
the O
economic O
and O
financial O
life O
of O
the O
country O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Jews O
were O
claimed O
to O
have O
a O
great O
interest O
, O
has O
been O
taken O
over O
by O
other O
Romanians O
. O

What O
has O
been O
reported O
in O
the O
press O
of O
neutral O
countries O
, O
namely O
that O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
is O
said O
to O
be O
negotiating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
Germany O
and O
with O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
concerning O
the O
removal O
from O
Bulgaria B-LOC
of O
significant O
groups O
of O
press O
of O
Israelites O
, O
is O
true O
. O

Germany O
has O
offered O
to O
transfer O
the O
Bulgarian O
Jewish O
groups O
to O
the O
ghettoes O
in O
Poland B-LOC
and O
has O
asked O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
to O
pay O
the O
sum O
of O
five O
- O
hundred O
marks O
per O
person O
for O
transport O
costs O
and O
in O
exchange O
for O
property O
seized O
locally O
. O

Bulgarians O
have O
resisted O
this O
request O
and O
for O
the O
time O
being O
nothing O
has O
been O
decided O
as O
yet O
on O
the O
financial O
question O
. O

However O
, O
the O
departures O
of O
Jews O
for O
Poland B-LOC
have O
already O
begun O
, O
albeit O
limited O
to O
the O
Jewish O
groups O
living O
in O
the O
new O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territories O
, O
Thrace B-LOC
and O
Macedonia B-LOC
, O
where O
there O
are O
Jewish O
communities O
that O
have O
been O
estimated O
at O
approx O
. O
twenty O
- O
thousand O
individuals O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
ancient O
Bulgarian B-LOC
territory O
nothing O
definite O
has O
been O
decided O
, O
because O
reportedly O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
opposing O
a O
marked O
resistance O
. O

With O
Great B-LOC
Britain I-LOC
there O
have O
been O
negotiations O
through O
the O
Swiss B-ORG
Government I-ORG
about O
dispatching O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
four O
- O
thousand O
adult O
Bulgarian O
Jews O
and O
four O
- O
thousand O
Jewish O
children O
. O

But O
the O
Reich O
has O
stepped O
in O
and O
in O
a O
certain O
sense O
has O
“ O
vetoed O
” O
this O
departure O
, O
judging O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
that O
it O
is O
dangerous O
to O
transfer O
to O
an O
enemy O
territory O
such O
decidedly O
anti O
- O
German O
elements O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
apparently O
, O
the O
Bulgarian B-ORG
Government I-ORG
has O
resumed O
these O
negotiations O
despite O
that O
“ O
veto O
” O
, O
limiting O
them O
to O
the O
four O
- O
thousand O
children O
who O
would O
be O
accompanied O
by O
no O
more O
than O
five O
- O
hundred O
adults O
. O

This O
negotiation O
as O
well O
, O
however O
, O
seems O
to O
encounter O
problems O
of O
a O
financial O
nature O

The O
Jews O
of O
Thessaloniki O
have O
been O
entirely O
excluded O
from O
any O
activity O
and O
have O
for O
over O
a O
week O
now O
been O
confined O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
unable O
to O
leave O
it O
for O
any O
reason O
whatsoever O
. O

Their O
entire O
property O
has O
been O
seized O
and O
will O
be O
managed O
through O
fiduciaries O
, O
who O
will O
have O
to O
deposit O
the O
proceeds O
from O
sales O
in O
a O
special O
blocked O
account O
. O

So O
far O
it O
is O
not O
precisely O
known O
if O
part O
of O
the O
sums O
thus O
obtained O
will O
be O
used O
for O
the O
sustenance O
of O
destitute O
Jews O
, O
who O
are O
the O
great O
majority O
. O

Several O
sources O
confirm O
that O
their O
transfer O
to O
Poland B-LOC
should O
start O
anytime O
now O
. O

German O
authorities O
have O
requested O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
a O
list O
of O
120 O
prominent O
persons O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
hostages O
. O

In O
this O
list O
there O
are O
also O
12 O
Italian O
citizens O
of O
Jewish O
race O
who O
, O
together O
with O
the O
others O
, O
were O
summoned O
on O
the O
7th O
inst O
. O
to O
the O
Community`s O
premises O
where O
a O
German O
officer O
gave O
a O
short O
speech O
and O
explained O
that O
they O
would O
answer O
with O
their O
own O
persons O
for O
any O
accident O
or O
act O
of O
sabotage O
that O
might O
occur O
. O

He O
added O
that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
his O
duty O
to O
intern O
them O
at O
once O
in O
a O
concentration O
camp O
, O
but O
that O
due O
to O
the O
assurances O
given O
by O
the O
Chief O
Rabbi O
he O
would O
let O
them O
stay O
free O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

The O
said O
prominent O
persons O
are O
also O
required O
to O
provide O
out O
of O
their O
own O
means O
for O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
poorer O
Jews O
. O

I O
have O
approached O
the O
Befehlshaber O
and O
was O
able O
to O
obtain O
his O
assurance O
that O
the O
Italian O
citizens O
will O
be O
removed O
from O
said O
list O
and O
we O
reached O
an O
understanding O
that O
they O
will O
no O
longer O
comply O
with O
the O
instructions O
and O
the O
orders O
they O
should O
still O
receive O
through O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
zeal O
displayed O
by O
the O
offices O
in O
charge O
of O
carrying O
out O
the O
adopted O
measures O
, O
I O
find O
myself O
compelled O
all O
the O
time O
to O
undertake O
steps O
to O
prevent O
our O
fellow O
- O
citizens O
from O
being O
hampered O
in O
their O
usual O
commercial O
activity O
. O

Until O
now O
, O
however O
, O
there O
have O
been O
only O
inevitable O
repercussions O
of O
a O
very O
limited O
and O
modest O
relevance O
. O

The O
sudden O
removal O
from O
town O
life O
of O
over O
50 O
thousand O
people O
, O
who O
for O
centuries O
had O
continuously O
been O
engaged O
in O
important O
activities O
, O
has O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
serious O
inconveniences O
. O

A O
great O
many O
services O
that O
were O
provided O
almost O
exclusively O
by O
Jews O
are O
now O
missing O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
commodities O
has O
increased O
sharply O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
the O
local O
press O
has O
been O
clamouring O
for O
severe O
steps O
against O
the O
Greek B-LOC
merchants O
who O
exploit O
the O
present O
moment O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
closing O
of O
the O
great O
many O
Jewish O
shops O
, O
to O
the O
diminished O
traffic O
in O
the O
streets O
and O
to O
the O
scarcity O
of O
public O
in O
cinemas O
and O
in O
restaurants O
- O
cafés O
, O
the O
town O
has O
acquired O
a O
look O

by O
a O
sense O
of O
sadness O

The O
Greek B-LOC
element O

except O
for O
the O

seen O
their O

, O
displays O
no O
enthusiasm O

all O
that O

done O

quite O
the O
opposite O

they O
worry O
about O
the O
immediate O
and O
future O
consequences O

The O
Jews O
who O
had O
been O

by O
us O
with O
a O
pass O
have O
been O
prevented O
by O
German O
authorities O
from O
reaching O
our O

I O
have O
enquired O
to O
see O
if O
some O
exception O
might O
not O
be O
granted O
for O
the O
most O
serious O
cases O
, O
but O
have O
received O
a O
negative O
answer O

in O
fact O
I O
was O
told O
that O
they O
would O
request O
that O
those O
who O
had O
already O
moved O

even O

the O

to O

the O

the O
total O
loss O

all O

the O
9,000 O
people O
about O

face O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
hardships O
that O
are O
inflicted O
on O
them O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
foresight O
or O
to O
mere O
brutality O

The O
most O
basic O

at O

only O

still O

The O
tragic O

logical O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
are O

According O

the O
total O
elimination O

in O
their O

themselves O

disapproves O
of O

what O
they O

Among O
the O
Jews O
there O
is O
resentment O
against O

because O
a O
rumour O

acts O

There O
have O
been O
several O
demises O

As O

gangs O
of O
Greek B-LOC
criminals O
broke O
into O
their O
homes O

order O

The O
Greek O

harsh O
orders O
whereby O
anyone O
entering O
a O
deserted O

home O
will O
be O
shot O

The O

to O
recruit O
more O
easily O

do O

” O
I O

the O

material O

[ O
… O
] O
The O
most O
cursory O
reading O
of O
the O
article O
shows O
that O
it O
was O
written O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
stirring O
up O
feeling O
against O
Jews O
as O
a O
class O
. O

The O
most O
definite O
charge O
is O
that O
of O
hoarding O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
Jews O
were O
long O
ago O
placed O
under O
the O
most O
rigid O
restrictions O
with O
regard O
to O
food O
. O

Further O
, O
they O
have O
been O
so O
thoroughly O
robbed O
of O
all O
their O
possessions O
, O
including O
all O
bank O
accounts O
, O
that O
few O
of O
them O
have O
any O
considerable O
wealth O
now O
at O
their O
disposal O
. O

The O
general O
terms O
employed O
by O
the O
writer O
would O
indicate O
that O
he O
is O
not O
writing O
on O
a O
factual O
basis O
but O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
an O
effect O
, O
that O
is O
, O
suspicion O
and O
hatred O
toward O
the O
Jew O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
inflammatory O
article O
against O
the O
Jews O
which O
has O
appeared O
in O
any O
newspaper O
for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

All O
evidence O
coming O
our O
[ O
sic O
] O
of O
Bulgaria B-LOC
indicates O
that O
the O
Bulgarian O
people O
generally O
disapprove O
of O
the O
harsh O
measures O

taken O
by O
the O

against O

what O

The O
recent O
protests O
by O
many O

by O
more O

of O

they O

As O
a O
result O

there O
is O
increasingly O
the O
view O
that O
something O
must O

this O

In O
response O
to O
this O
, O
In O
the O
“ O
Law O
for O
the O
Protection O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
” O
promulgated O
in O
January B-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
the O
Government O
established O
several O
articles O
concerning O
the O
Jewish O
population O
. O

However O
, O
the O
actual O
effect O
was O
rather O
limited O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
last O
fall O
the O
government O
received O
full O
authority O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
Jews O
. O

Consequently O
, O
they O
established O
a O
new O
bureau O
and O
required O
Jews O
to O
wear O
yellow O
tags O
, O
placed O
limitation O
on O
their O
residence O
as O
well O
as O
on O
their O
activities O
besides O
business O
, O
and O
their O
control O

2.6 O
billion O

The O
government O
pursued O
a O
policy O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
Germany B-LOC

However O
, O
such O
policies O
were O
not O
very O
popular O

In O

the O
vice O
speaker O

the O

about O
forty O
members O

criticized O
the O
government O
measures O

leading O
to O
the O
resignation O
of O
the O
vice O
speaker O
. O

( O
There O
is O
rumor O
that O
the O
Jews O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
for O
this O
) O
. O

Recently O
many O
Jews O
are O
accused O
of O
being O
involved O

sabotage O

spying O

other O
forms O
of O
political O

and O
engaging O
in O
black O
market O
that O
should O
be O
called O
the O
cancer O
of O
Bulgarian O
economy O
. O

The O
government O
came O
to O
force O
Jews O
living O
in O
Sofia B-LOC
to O
relocate O
to O
local O
areas O
because O
it O
was O
not O
very O
successful O
to O
leave O
the O
matter O
to O
their O
own O
will O
( O
only O
2,600 O
had O
moved O
out O
so O
far O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
the O
government O
will O
notify O
Jews O
about O
the O
destination O
for O
their O
relocation O
within O
two O
to O
three O
weeks O

After O
receiving O
the O
notice O
the O
Jews O
must O
leave O
the O
city O
within O
three O
days O

Concerning O
this O
new O
measure O
the O
head O
of O
the O
Orthodox O
Church O
Stephan B-PERS
and O
others O
lodged O
protest O
against O
and O
it O
was O
not O
very O
popular O
in O
general O

The O
Government O
, O
however O
, O
considers O
that O
the O
city O

political O

economic O
condition O
will O
improve O
after O
the O

all O

Monsignor O
Cassulo O

believed O

have O
been O
a O
voyage O
of O
inspection O
in O
order O
to O
report O
to O
the O

on O
the O
matter O

As O
to O
the O
question O
if O
the O
Nuncio O
’s O
journey O
served O
indeed O
the O
purpose O
of O
providing O
an O
exact O
picture O
of O
the O
Jewish O
situation O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
I O
already O
reported O
on O
this O
in O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
report O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
Nuncio O
was O
not O
convinced O
by O
the O
tame O
ghetto O
he O
was O
shown O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
Vatican O
concerning O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
was O
joined O
by O
further O
pressure O
from O
the O
international O
Red O
Cross O
, O
which O
has O
friends O
and O
supporters O
among O
the O
highest O
Romanian O
circles O
. O

As O
for O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
is O
as O
follows O
. O

When O
Romanian B-LOC
and O
German O
troops O
occupied O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews O
at O
first O
experienced O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

During O
the O
first O
days O
– O
particularly O
in O
Odessa B-LOC
where O
there O
were O
about O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
persons O
who O
had O
not O
been O
evacuated O
– O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
carried O
out O
a O
registration O
and O
some O
arrests O
. O

After O
the O
terrorist O
acts O
and O
particularly O
after O
the O
one O
of O
23rd O
October O
there O
were O
brutal O
reprisals O
. O

It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
give O
numbers O
, O
but O
many O
thousands O
, O
perhaps O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
Jews O
were O
eliminated O
and O
arrested O
. O

In O
was O
then O
that O
temporary O
ghettoes O
and O
places O
for O
concentration O
were O
created O
. O

Orders O
however O
were O
as O
yet O
unclear O
, O
and O
already O
in O
November O
many O
of O
these O
Jews O
were O
set O
free O
. O

It O
was O
only O
in O
December O
’ O
41 O
and O
in O
January O
’ O
42 O
, O
during O
the O
harshest O
of O
winters O
, O
that O
Romanian B-LOC
authorities O
decided O
to O
remove O
the O
Jews O
from O
Odessa B-LOC
. O

I O
hardly O
need O
to O
describe O
how O
this O
emigration O
took O
place O
. O

The O
Germans O
themselves O
admit O
that O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carried O
out O
with O
greater O
humanity O
. O

Anyway O
, O
those O
who O
managed O
to O
reach O
on O
foot O
the O
places O
of O
concentration O
, O
were O
banned O
to O
ghettoes O
, O
that O
is O
to O
sites O
in O
the O
suburbs O
of O
small O
provincial O
towns O
. O

Considering O
the O
meteorological O
and O
political O
climate O
, O
they O
were O
treated O
with O
scant O
regard O
and O
no O
doubt O
the O
well O
- O
known O
oppressive O
measures O
will O
have O
continued O
there O
, O
set O
off O
by O
local O
authorities O
. O

The O
Germans O
, O
for O
their O
part O
, O
have O
acted O
similarly O
in O
the O
areas O
surrounding O
the O
territories O
inhabited O
by O
German O
communities O
. O

This O
system O
of O
things O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
has O
been O
useful O
to O
all O
to O
rebuild O
what O
had O
been O
destroyed O
, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
losses O
and O
to O
create O
benefits O
, O
lasted O
more O
or O
less O
intensely O
, O
more O
or O
less O
arbitrarily O
until O
June O
of O
last O
year O
. O

After O
that O
the O
situation O
stabilized O
or O
, O
to O
put O
it O
more O
exactly O
, O
was O
rendered O
legal O
. O

For O
a O
start O
, O
rules O
began O
to O
be O
published O
regarding O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
of O
Jews O
, O
the O
deadline O
for O
reporting O
to O
the O
ghetto O
, O
also O
the O
activity O
of O
Jews O
inside O
and O
outside O
the O
ghettoes O
has O
been O
specified O
, O
they O
have O
been O
granted O
a O
form O
of O
self O
- O
government O
, O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
if O
the O
oppressive O
measures O
have O
ceased O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
would O
depend O
on O
the O
local O
authorities O
and O
on O
whether O
the O
Jews O
are O
able O
to O
reach O
a O
compromise O
with O
them O
. O

What O
can O
be O
said O
with O
certainty O
is O
that O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
during O
the O
past O
months O
the O
situation O
of O
Jews O
has O
not O
grown O
any O
worse O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
this O
in O
person O
. O

In O
Balta B-LOC
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
approx O
. O
fifteen O
thousand O
Jews O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
ghetto O
is O
in O
a O
suburban O
part O
of O
the O
town O
and O
is O
made O
up O
of O
wretched O
cottages O
where O
a O
great O
many O
families O
live O
in O
deplorable O
hygienic O
conditions O
. O

There O
is O
a O
curfew O
imposed O
on O
the O
ghetto O
which O
starts O
at O
sundown O
. O

The O
Jews O
are O
not O
allowed O
into O
the O
public O
market O
, O
nor O
can O
they O
frequent O
the O
town O
’s O
establishments O
. O

There O
is O
a O
municipal O
authority O
that O
manages O
the O
community O
and O
supplies O
the O
required O
manpower O
. O

Jews O
are O
employed O
in O
public O
works O
in O
the O
towns O
and O
in O
the O
surrounding O
areas O
. O

Those O
who O
work O
receive O
one O
mark O
a O
day O
and O
a O
substantial O
bread O
ration O
. O

The O
more O
unfortunate O
Jews O
, O
however O
, O
live O
or O
rather O
vegetate O
inside O
the O
ghetto O
; O

the O
more O
able O
ones O
and O
particularly O
the O
young O
female O
elements O
manage O
to O
find O
ways O
to O
live O
outside O
the O
ghetto O
and O
in O
any O
case O
enjoy O
visible O
advantages O
for O
their O
lives O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
this O
situation O
in O
Balta B-LOC
and O
also O
in O
Rybnitsa B-LOC
is O
more O
or O
less O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
other O
ghettoes O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
numbers O
of O
deported O
or O
concentrated O
Jews O
change O
all O
the O
time O
. O

( O
I O
have O
myself O
seen O
in O
Balta B-LOC
about O
a O
thousand O
Jews O
just O
arrived O
from O
Romania B-LOC
, O
mostly O
young O
people O
assigned O
to O
four O
months O
of O
compulsory O
work O
there O
) O
. O

In O
Bereswka O
a O
certain O
number O
of O
Jews O
has O
even O
been O
assigned O
to O
the O
Prefecture O
, O
to O
posts O
of O
varying O
importance O
, O
with O
regular O
salaries O
. O

This O
denotes O
a O
marked O
improvement O
compared O
to O
last O
year O
. O

The O
fact O
in O
itself O
would O
not O
have O
any O
great O
significance O
, O
if O
some O
recent O
information O
, O
such O
as O
the O
news O
that O
has O
prompted O
the O
present O
report O
, O
did O
not O
confer O
on O
the O
situation O
an O
aspect O
that O
I O
believe O
ought O
to O
be O
pointed O
out O
. O

I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
an O
excellent O
source O
that O
recently O
, O
at O
an O
ordinary O
conference O
of O
the O
Prefects O
of O
Transnistria B-LOC
held O
by O
the O
Governor O
in O
Rybniysa B-LOC
, O
these O
officials O
allegedly O
gave O
as O
their O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
present O
situation O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
war O
remains O
uncertain O
at O
the O
very O
least O
, O
it O
seemed O
advisable O
to O
improve O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
or O
to O
lessen O
the O
restrictions O
on O
their O
freedom O
and O
allow O
them O
ways O
to O
resume O
a O
greater O
activity O
. O

Reportedly O
there O
was O
even O
talk O
of O
giving O
the O
Jews O
some O
compensation O
for O
the O
damages O
they O
have O
suffered O
. O

Thus O
their O
situation O
would O
be O
rendered O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
Jews O
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
and O
in O
other O
Romanian B-LOC
towns O
. O

Naturally O
this O
news O
, O
which O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
discernible O
general O
trend O
towards O
improving O
the O
condition O
of O
Jews O
, O
has O
annoyed O
German O
circles O
and O
made O
them O
mistrustful O
. O

They O
suggest O
that O
the O
Jewish O
question O
cannot O
be O
handled O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
any O
differently O
from O
how O
it O
has O
been O
handled O
until O
now O
. O

The O
reasons O
given O
by O
the O
Prefects O
and O
by O
those O
in O
favour O
of O
improving O
the O
treatment O
of O
Jews O
arise O
from O
a O
pessimistic O
view O
of O
the O
Axis O
’ O
s O
general O
situation O
, O
and O
that O
is O
totally O
unacceptable O
. O

They O
are O
therefore O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
entire O
matter O
is O
essentially O
decided O
by O
the O
Government O
in O
Bucharest B-LOC
, O
which O
is O
influenced O
by O
the O
steps O
undertaken O
by O
the O
Vatican O
and O
by O
Geneva O
, O
and O
has O
easily O
taken O
root O
in O
the O
Anglophile O
and O
Francophile O
circles O
, O
whether O
military O
or O
civilian O
, O
of O
Romania B-LOC
. O

The O
Jewish O
question O
in O
Transnistria B-LOC
is O
therefore O
believed O
to O
be O
an O
indication O
of O
the O
general O
situation O
in O
Romania O
and O
of O
the O
opinion O
held O
by O
certain O
classes O
of O
Romanians B-LOC
concerning O
the O
development O
of O
that O
situation O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
am O
reporting O
all O
this O
because O
it O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
ascertained O
facts O
and O
conversations O
that O
have O
actually O
taken O
place O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
, O
in O
any O
case O
, O
that O
in O
local O
Romanian B-LOC
circles O
there O
is O
a O
widespread O
feeling O
that O
the O
present O
events O
warrant O
serious O
worries O
, O
a O
feeling O
caused O
mainly O
by O
the O
uncertainty O

the O

For O
this O

one O

rely O

the O

this O

the O

from O
the O
beginning O

were O
directed O
mainly O

Full O

The O
Jewish O
question O
in O
Germany B-LOC
. O

During O
the O
period O
from O
spring O
1940 O
to O
Spring O
1943 O
, O
the O
Jews O
in O
Germany O
were O
deported O
. O

The O
deportation O
began O
in O
Stettin B-LOC
in O
February B-DATE
1940 I-DATE
and O
is O
now O
largely O
completed O
, O
so O
that O
all O
the O
elderly O
( O
originally O
over O
65 O
, O
now O
over O
70 O
years O
) O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-LOC
in O
the O
Bohemia O
- O
Moravian O
Protectorate O
, O
whose O
former O
population O
had O
been O
evacuated O
. O

The O
city O
, O
which O
originally O
had O
20 O
to O
25,000 O
inhabitants O
, O
now O
contains O
approx O
. O
50,000 O
Jews O
. O

However O
, O
because O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
population O
consists O
only O
of O
the O
Old O
people O
, O
the O
passing O
is O
still O
very O
large O
. O

Young O
Jews O
have O
been O
deployed O
to O
work O
in O
various O
locations O
in O
the O
eastern O
areas O
. O

The O
deportation O
has O
been O
practiced O
somewhat O
differently O
in O
the O
different O
regions O
of O
Germany B-LOC
. O

The O
exceptions O
that O
apply O
to O
certain O
areas O
of O
the O
measures O
against O
the O
Jews O
under O
the O
legislation O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Jews O
married O
to O
Aryans O
, O
have O
not O
been O
fully O
observed O
during O
the O
Deportations O
. O

The O
Jewish O
spouse O
in O
such O
a O
marriage O
is O
usually O
spared O
only O
when O
he O
or O
she O
lives O
with O
the O
Aryan O
partner O
or O
with O
any O
common O
Children O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
children O
are O
minors O
or O
adults O
. O

Thus O
, O
there O
are O
several O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
men O
married O
to O
Aryan O
women O
have O
been O
deported O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
no O
cases O
where O
Jewish O
women O
married O
to O
Aryan O
men O
were O
deported O
. O

There O
must O
also O
have O
been O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
Jewish O
spouse O
has O
been O
deported O
after O
the O
couple O
's O
only O
son O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
, O
which O
otherwise O
in O
Jewish O
laws O
justifies O
a O
privileged O
position O
. O

This O
is O
motivated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
exception O
from O
deportation O
can O
only O
be O
justified O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
the O
spouse O
or O
children O
, O
and O
that O
this O
consideration O
no O
longer O
applies O
when O
the O
child O
does O
not O
live O
at O
home O
, O
cf O
. O
above O
, O
or O
has O
fallen O
in O
the O
war O
. O

Although O
Jewish O
law O
in O
principle O
applies O
only O
to O
Jews O
, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
special O
provisions O
in O
the O
Practice O
of O
Mischlinge O
( O
Half O
and O
Quarter O
Jews O
) O
that O
they O
must O
be O
regarded O
as O
a O
special O
class O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
in O
all O
areas O
where O
the O
Administration O
’s O
decisions O
are O
decisive O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
attitude O
must O
be O
considered O
. O

Within O
leading O
circles O
, O
there O
are O
two O
movements O
, O
one O
that O
wants O
to O
restrict O
the O
Jewish O
laws O
to O
the O
real O
Jews O
, O
and O
one O
more O
radical O
that O
wants O
to O
liberate O
Germany O
from O
both O
Jews O
and O
Bastards O
. O

Which O
movement O
ultimately O
prevails O
is O
impossible O
to O
say O
, O
but O
the O
radical O
direction O
in O
recent O
times O
seems O
to O
assert O
itself O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
the O
provision O
introduced O
in O
1942 O
, O
whereby O
half O
Jews O
are O
excluded O
from O
the O
army O
, O
could O
be O
fatal O
. O

One O
has O
to O
consider O
, O
that O
the O
definition O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
citizenship O
links O
to O
the O
right O
to O
exercise O
civil O
rights O
such O
as O
military O
service O
and O
labor O
service O
. O

Therefore O
Mischlinge O
, O
who O
fail O
to O
serve O
, O
are O
prevented O
from O
enjoying O
civil O
rights O
. O

[ O
… O
] O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
in O
the O
Legislature O
of O
Quarter O
Jews O
marrying O
non O
- O
Jews O
, O
the O
Standesämter O
refuse O
to O
marry O
such O
persons O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
special O
permit O
. O

The O
limited O
access O
of O
the O
Mischlinge O
to O
- O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Half O
Jews O
, O
total O
exclusion O
from O
- O
the O
higher O
education O
( O
including O
vocational O
schools O
) O
may O
in O
the O
future O
have O
the O
most O
fateful O
consequences O
, O
with O
Half O
Jews O
subsequently O
missing O
the O
prerequisite O
for O
becoming O
anything O
but O
unskilled O
workers O
. O

Mischlinge O
are O
excluded O
from O
owning O
an O
inheritance O
farm O
, O
requiring O
Aryan O
descent O
since O
1800 O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
other O
land O
estates O
, O
there O
is O
no O
prohibition O
, O
but O
in O
practice O
, O
Mischlinge O
will O
generally O
be O
forced O
out O
of O
possession O
of O
such O
property O
, O
the O
same O
applies O
to O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
of O
Jews O
. O

Mischlinge O
and O
non O
- O
Jewish O
spouses O
have O
free O
access O
to O
private O
businesses O
. O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
in O
Practice O
they O
will O
often O
be O
pushed O
out O
of O
Companies O
of O
any O
significance O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
armour O
industry O
– O
companies O
owned O
them O
or O
within O
which O
they O
play O
a O
large O
role O
will O
be O
excluded O
from O
public O
order O
. O

There O
are O
still O
rumours O
in O
Berlin B-LOC
of O
further O
measures O
taken O
against O
the O
Jews O
, O
e.g O
. O
, O
it O
states O
that O
a O
law O
must O
be O
drawn O
up O
, O
requiring O
Aryans O
who O
are O
married O
to O
Jews O
to O
divorce O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
Jewish O
law O
in O
its O
full O
extent O
could O
be O
put O
into O
effect O
also O
for O
the O
group O
of O
Jews O
who O
have O
hitherto O
been O
allowed O
to O
stay O
because O
they O
were O
married O
to O
Aryans O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
rumours O
have O
been O
spread O
regarding O
certain O
measures O
against O
half O
Jews O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
Mischlinge O
in O
cities O
, O
where O
the O
housing O
demand O
is O
high O
due O
to O
the O
devastation O
caused O
by O
airstrikes O
, O
should O
be O
evicted O
from O
their O
apartments O
. O

Whether O
this O
will O
happen O
is O
impossible O
to O
predict O
. O

However O
, O
with O
some O
anxiety O
, O
it O
has O
been O
noted O
that O
the O
Campaign O
against O
the O
Jews O
in O
the O
Press O
has O
now O
been O
intensified O
again O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
lately O
, O
Mischlinge O
has O
been O
referred O
to O
as O
Bastards O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Mischling O
problem O
is O
to O
a O
significant O
degree O
an O
upper O
- O
class O
problem O
; O

since O
the O
mixed O
marriages O
have O
mainly O
taken O
place O
within O
the O
bourgeoisie O
, O
there O
could O
also O
be O
an O
unfortunate O
impact O
on O
the O
position O
of O
the O
Mischlinge O

to O
justify O
the O

Precautions O
against O
the O

by O
stating O
first O
, O
that O
Italian B-ORG
Jews O
under O

were O
active O

an O
anti O

the O

and O
that O
before O

as O
is O
evident O
from O
various O
texts O
quoted O

sought O
to O
instigate O

There O
is O
thus O
no O
doubt O
about O
their O
responsibility O

The O
logical O
answer O
is O
that O
we O
should O
exterminate O
the O
Jews O
. O

But O
, O
as O
always O
, O
the O
Italian B-ORG
people O
appear O
extremely O
noble O

have O
confined O
themselves O
to O

them O

is O
wanted O
and O
praised O
by O
the O

What O
is O
more O

than O

thus O
the O

Filov B-PERS

Lately O

the O
Jews O
were O
being O
shot O

only O

Jagow B-PERS
told O
me O
that O
his O
dear O
friend O
Ludin B-PERS
is O
a O
very O
good O

The O
decision O

done O
in O

thus O
the O

Although O
there O
is O
currently O
a O
fallback O
in O
Russia B-LOC

it O
is O
said O
that O
the O
Führer O
ordered O
the O
German B-LOC

to O
fight O

as O
they O
can O
only O

Similarly O
it O
goes O

The O
clearing O

a O

On O

dined O
at O
Mr. O
Veesenmayer B-PERS
and O
we O
had O
a O
lengthier O
discussion O

out O
of O
which O
I O
want O
to O
quote O
few O
interesting O
things O
: O

[ O
... O

I O
mentioned O
to O
Veesenmayer B-PERS
Ludin B-PERS
' O
s O
intervention O
in O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
in O
our O
country B-LOC
and O
he O
explained O
it O
to O
me O
as O
follows O
: O

According O
to O
him O
, O
neither O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
government O
, O
nor O
the O
high O
Hungarian B-LOC
officials O
intervened O
in O
the O
question O
of O
Slovak B-LOC
Jews O
. O

Although O
Hungarians B-LOC
sometimes O
try O
to O
talk O
bad O
about O
Germans B-LOC
in O
our O
country B-LOC
, O
it O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
this O
situation O
. O

He O
intervened O
on O
his O
own O
initiative O
. O

He O
has O
been O
hearing O
information O
that O
Jews O
were O
, O
in O
large O
numbers O
, O
fleeing O
to O
Slovakia B-LOC
( O
to O
explain O
it O
, O
there O
are O
the O
German B-LOC
SS B-ORG
soldiers O
in O
about O
each O
fifth O
village O
and O
they O
report O
on O
their O
observations O
) O
. O

He O
got O
direct O
reports O
that O
from O
the O
eastern O
part O
of O
the O
country B-LOC
Jews O
were O
fleeing O
to O
Slovakia B-LOC
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
Jewish O
children O
, O
he O
knows O
only O
about O
around O
500 O
– O
700 O
kids O
who O
came O
to O
our O
country B-LOC
. O

He O
also O
emphasized O
that O
by O
now O
over O
20 O
secret O
Jewish O
radio O
channels O
were O
discovered O
. O

Two O
days O
ago O
, O
they O
discovered O
a O
radio O
station O
in O
which O
Jews O
from O
Hungary B-LOC
, O
Romania B-LOC
and O
who O
knows O
what O
other O
nationality O
played O
part O
. O

He O
is O
aware O
of O
about O
4000 O
Jews O
who O
escaped O
to O
Slovakia B-LOC
. O

They O
have O
specific O
proofs O
that O
even O
some O
of O
the O
convicted O
escaped O
there O
. O

In O
Slovakia B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
has O
been O
already O
sorted O
out O
, O
the O
mass O
waves O
of O
new O
Jews O
can O
cause O
further O
troubles O
. O

He O
is O
therefore O
planning O
a O
visit O
to O
Slovakia B-LOC
, O
to O
talk O
to O
Ludin B-PERS
about O
this O
issue O
in O
person O
. O

( O
He O
would O
also O
like O
to O
buy O
Lipas O
, O
which O
are O
the O
best O
cigarettes O
in O
the O
world O
. O

I O
will O
provide O
him O
with O
these O
. O
) O
In O
general O
, O
he O
wants O
the O
borders O
to O
be O
closed O
more O
tightly O
, O
so O
that O
the O
Hungarian B-LOC
Jews O
cannot O
cross O
pass O
. O

I O
suppose O
he O
will O
be O
asking O
for O
the O
cross O
passers O
to O
be O
handed O
over O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
overall O
situation O
, O
he O
mentioned O
the O
plans O
for O
a O
new O
German B-LOC
attack O
on O
the O
British B-LOC
, O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O

Horthy B-PERS
has O
been O
lately O
sending O
several O
letters O
to O
his O
government O
. O

From O
his O
latest O
letter O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
he O
is O
not O
wholeheartedly O
against O
the O
actions O
on O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
in O
Hungary B-LOC
; O

however O
, O
he O
disapproves O
of O
the O
methods O
and O
cruelties O
that O
were O
supposedly O
happening O
during O
its O
resolution O
. O

The O
impulse O
for O
this O
letter O
came O
from O
the O
interventions O
of O
the O
Pope B-PERS
, O
the O
papal O
nuncio O
, O
Séredy O
  O
and O
the O
King B-PERS
of I-PERS
Sweden I-PERS
. O

For O
now O
, O
in O
the O
process O
of O
the O
Jewish O
Question O
several O
categories O
were O
created O
, O
all O
of O
which O
will O
be O
dealt O
with O
differently O
. O

In O
one O
of O
these O
categories O
are O
the O
Jews O
of O
Swedish B-LOC
and O
Swiss B-LOC
nationality O
, O
together O
about O
300 O
– O
400 O
people O
, O
who O
will O
be O
given O
to O
the O
Swedish B-LOC
or O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
government O
. O

In O
the O
next O
category O
are O
the O
Zionist O
Jews O
, O
who O
are O
intervened O
for O
by O
the O
neutral O
powers O
and O
with O
help O
of O
the O
Swiss B-LOC
Red O
Cross O
, O
there O
are O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
Palestine B-LOC
. O

The O
last O
category O
is O
that O
of O
the O
baptised O
Jews O
, O
whose O
registration O
has O
already O
started O
and O
they O
will O
be O
dealt O
with O
differently O
than O
the O
other O
Jews O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
very O
odd O
that O
the O
head O
of O
the O
state O
is O

Miss O
X O
First O
of O
all O
I O
should O
like O
to O
point O
out O
that O
in O
some O
respects O
my O
story O
is O
not O
a O
typical O
one O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
living O
in O
an O
entirely O
non O
- O
Jewish O
household O
, O
am O
of O
Nordic O
appearance O
, O
and O
was O
converted O
in O
June B-DATE
1933 I-DATE
from O
my O
father O
’s O
Jewish O
to O
my O
mother O
’s O
Protestant O
faith O
probably O
saved O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
unpleasantness O
. O

Neither O
my O
father O
nor O
my O
mother O
are O
strict O
in O
their O
respective O
religions O
, O
and O
my O
early O
religious O
upbringing O
had O
been O
correspondingly O
liberal O
; O

so O
that O
the O
conversion O
itself O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
remember O
, O
made O
little O
impression O
on O
me O
. O

The O
practical O
significance O
, O
however O
, O
became O
soon O
apparent O
: O

At O
that O
time O
I O
attended O
a O
private O
school O
with O
a O
large O
number O
of O
Jewish O
pupils O
. O

Towards O
the O
end O
of O
1933 B-DATE
the O
classes O
were O
separated O
into O
a O
Christian O
and O
a O
Jewish O
section O
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
not O
on O
official O
orders O
, O
but O
the O
initiative O
of O
the O
Headmaster O
. O

I O
was O
at O
first O
put O
into O
the O
Jewish O
section O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
was O
made O
to O
realize O
the O
problem O
of O
my O
part O
- O
Jewish O
parentage O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
that O
I O
was O
very O
upset O
. O

My O
mother O
protested O
to O
the O
Headmaster O
, O
and O
I O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Christian O
section O
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
incident O
, O
my O
school O
- O
life O
was O
quite O
happy O
when O
I O
was O
twelve O
I O
changed O
over O
to O
a O
Lyzeum O
. O

The O
school O
kept O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
to O
its O
liberal O
traditions O
. O

The O
teachers O
showed O
no O
discrimination O
against O
me O
, O
although O
they O
all O
learned O
sooner O
or O
later O
that O
I O
was O
half O
- O
Jewish O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
my O
work O
was O
seriously O
affected O
by O
worry O
about O
my O
father O
in O
London B-LOC
, O
my O
Latin O
mistress O
went O
out O
of O
her O
way O
to O
be O
sympathetic O
and O
helpful O
. O

There O
was O
only O
one O
master O
who O
evidenced O
animosity O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
this O
was O
from O
racial O
prejudice O
. O

In O
such O
lessons O
as O
German B-LOC
, O
history O
and O
geography O
we O
were O
taught O
an O
exaggerated O
patriotism O
rather O
than O
specifically O
National O
Socialist O
doctrines O
. O

I O
cannot O
recall O
any O
direct O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
observations O
Jewish O
achievements O
were O
simply O
not O
mentioned O
. O

The O
names O
of O
Spinoza O
, O
Ehrlich O
, O
Offenbach O
and O
Einstein O
- O
to O
gave O
but O
a O
few O
examples O
- O
were O
unknown O
to O
me O
until O
I O
came O
to O
England B-LOC
after O
the O
war O
. O

I O
was O
the O
only O
non O
- O
Aryan O
in O
my O
class O
. O

There O
were O
some O
other O
half O
- O
Jewish O
girls O
in O
the O
school O
and O
I O
learnt O
from O
hearsay O
that O
their O
position O
was O
sometimes O
difficult O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
was O
always O
on O
excellent O
terms O
with O
my O
class O
- O
mates O
. O

My O
class O
may O
have O
been O
exceptional O
in O
that O
it O
contained O
not O
a O
single O
ardent O
Nazi O
. O

At O
first O
my O
fellow O
pupils O
did O
not O
know O
of O
being O
half O
- O
Jewish O
. O

When O
somebody O
told O
them O
they O
decided O
, O
as O
I O
learnt O
later O
, O
to O
hide O
their O
knowledge O
from O
me O
in O
order O
to O
spare O
me O
any O
embarrassment O
. O

We O
were O
altogether O
not O
greatly O
interested O
in O
politics O
. O

I O
passed O
my O
Abitur O
in O
1941 B-DATE
, O
the O
last O
year O
when O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
allowed O
to O
do O
so O
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
I O
was O
faced O
with O
my O
first O
real O
difficulties O
. O

Politics O
had O
entered O
into O
my O
home O
life O
earlier O
and O
more O
forcefully O
. O

My O
mother O
was O
a O
violent O
anti O
- O
Nazi O
. O

She O
talked O
very O
freely O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
constant O
fear O
that O
she O
would O
be O
arrested O
. O

My O
step O
- O
father O
was O
a O
Nazi O
of O
the O
idealistic O
type O
, O
who O
expected O
wonderful O
things O
of O
the O
Third O
Reich O
. O

There O
were O
frequent O
and O
sometimes O
rather O
violent O
political O
arguments O
between O
him O
and O
my O
mother O
. O

About O
Jews O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
strong O
feelings O
either O
for O
and O
against O
, O
and O
he O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
if O
were O
his O
own O
daughter O
. O

He O
had O
been O
a O
Party O
member O
, O
but O
although O
he O
had O
been O
told O
that O
the O
Party O
would O
not O
object O
to O
his O
marrying O
the O
former O
wife O
of O
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
mother O
of O
a O
half O
- O
Jewish O
child O
, O
he O
was O
afterwards O
put O
under O
pressure O
to O
leave O
the O
Party O
. O

My O
presence O
caused O
a O
number O
of O
problems O
, O
especially O
after O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war O
. O

I O
particularly O
remember O
the O
problem O
of O
ration O
stamps O
: O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
ration O
stamps O
were O
distributed O
into O
the O
households O
by O
the O
street O
warden O
; O

but O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans O
had O
to O
collect O
them O
personally O
from O
a O
special O
Centre O
. O

This O
applied O
also O
to O
every O
member O
of O
a O
household O
which O
contained O
a O
non- O
Aryan O
. O

To O
be O
seen O
regularly O
at O
this O
Centre O
for O
Jews O
and O
non- O
Aryans O
would O
have O
gravely O
endangered O
my O
step O
- O
father O
’s O
position O
in O
the O
firm O
which O
employed O
him O
. O

He O
finally O
managed O
to O
obtain O
dispensation O
from O
the O
rule O
, O
but O
we O
were O
still O
obliged O
to O
collect O
our O
ration O
stamps O
from O
the O
Food O
Office O
direct O
, O
and O
were O
not O
granted O
occasional O
extra O
rations O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
. O

This O
and O
similar O
difficulties O
are O
trifling O
in O
retrospect O
, O
but O
seemed O
very O
important O
at O
the O
time O
and O
made O
me O
disturbingly O
aware O
of O
my O
inferior O
status O
in O
the O
Third O
Reich O
. O

This O
feeling O
increased O
with O
the O
problems O
which O
arose O
on O
my O
leaving O
school O
. O

I O
had O
set O
my O
heart O
on O
a O
University O
education O
, O
but O
one O
could O
not O
be O
enrolled O
at O
a O
Univerity O
before O
having O
completed O
the O
six O
months O
’s O
Labour O
Service O
( O
Arbeitsdienst O
) O
, O
from O
which O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
excluded O
. O

Instead O
, O
we O
had O
to O
complete O
a O
Year O
of O
Duty O
( O
Pflichtjahr O
at O
some O
place O
where O
there O
was O
urgent O
need O
for O
a O
servant O
, O
as O
in O
families O
with O
many O
children O
. O

In O
my O
first O
service O
of O
this O
kind O
I O
did O
not O
mention O
that O
I O
was O
half O
- O
Jewish O
; O

when O
my O
employer O
was O
informed O
of O
it O
, O
I O
was O
dismissed O
. O

I O
finished O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
in O
the O
service O
of O
the O
wife O
of O
a O
Protestant O
cleric O
, O
Kirchenrätin O
Viebig O
. O

She O
was O
markedly O
pro O
- O
Jewish O
, O
keeping O
up O
contact O
, O
at O
great O
risk O
to O
herself O
, O
with O
her O
Jewish O
friends O
until O
these O
were O
deported O
. O

I O
was O
treated O
more O
as O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
house O
than O
as O
a O
servant O
. O

During O
that O
time O
9 O
made O
several O
further O
application O
for O
admittance O
into O
the O
Labour O
Service O
. O

I O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
suggest O
that O
I O
was O
the O
illegitimate O
child O
of O
an O
Aryan O
father O
. O

I O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O

I O
felt O
very O
bitter O
about O
the O
whole O
situation O
in O
a O
quite O
childishly O
self O
- O
centred O
way O
. O

I O
blamed O
my O
mother O
for O
having O
married O
a O
Jew O
, O
and O
several O
times O
even O
told O
her O
so O
to O
her O
face O
. O

It O
was O
not O
that O
I O
experienced O
any O
conflict O
of O
loyalties O
or O
felt O
tainted O
by O
my O
Jewish O
blood O
. O

I O
simply O
resented O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
was O
under O
a O
special O
handicap O
; O

most O
of O
all O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
start O
a O
career O
to O
which O
I O
felt O
my O
talents O
and O
education O
entitled O
me O
. O

Inconsistently O
, O
perhaps O
, O
this O
did O
not O
affect O
feelings O
towards O
my O
father O
. O

I O
had O
always O
been O
on O
most O
affectionate O
terms O
with O
him O
. O

From O
the O
time O
when O
my O
parents O
separated O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
his O
emigration O
I O
had O
visited O
him O
regularly O
. O

Shortly O
before O
the O
outbreak O
of O
war O
I O
spent O
a O
holidays O
with O
him O
in O
London B-LOC
, O
and O
even O
considered O
for O
a O
while O
joining O
him O
there O
permanently O
. O

All O
through O
the O
war O
I O
tried O
to O
obtain O
news O
from O
him O
though O
the O
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
. O

My O
social O
relations O
with O
other O
young O
people O
were O
less O
problematic O
than O
the O
official O
discrimination O
against O
non O
- O
Aryans O
would O
lead O
one O
to O
expect O
. O

None O
of O
my O
old O
friends O
changed O
her O
or O
his O
attitude O
. O

Whenever O
I O
met O
a O
young O
man O
who O
seemed O
to O
take O
an O
illegible O
interest O
in O
me O
I O
told O
him O
at O
once O
that O
I O
was O
half O
- O
Jewish O
. O

I O
rather O
enjoyed O
the O
special O
implications O
. O

I O
considered O
such O
firendships O
and O
flirtations O
as O
proof O
that O
my O
personal O
attractions O
were O
stronger O
than O
the O
influence O
of O
official O
disapproval O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
I O
found O
that O
at O
least O
in O
the O
circles O
in O
which O
I O
moved O
the O
younger O
generation O
took O
Nazi O
doctrines O
far O
less O
seriously O
than O
their O
elders O
. O

The O
interest O
of O
my O
friends O
was O
mainly O
limited O
to O
their O
personal O
affairs O
; O

they O
were O
rather O
cynical O
in O
their O
attitude O
to O
politics O
and O
the O
war O
. O

The O
one O
exception O
I O
remember O
was O
, O
curiously O
enough O
, O
a O
Czech B-LOC
with O
whom O
I O
formed O
a O
serious O
attachment O
. O

He O
had O
pronounced O
anti O
- O
Jewish O
feeling O
, O
and O
at O
first O
I O
could O
not O
find O
the O
moral O
courage O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
my O
father O
was O
Jewish O
. O

When O
I O
told O
him O
eventually O
, O
he O
got O
over O
the O
shock O
after O
having O
wrestled O
with O
the O
problem O
, O
as O
he O
told O
me O
, O
for O
a O
whole O
sleepless O
night O
. O

Our O
friendship O
continued O
, O
and O
at O
one O
stage O
we O
seriously O
considered O
marrying O
. O

This O
brought O
home O
to O
me O
the O
paradox O
of O
my O
position O
in O
regard O
to O
marriage O
: O

as O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
I O
could O
marry O
neither O
a O
Jew O
nor O
an O
Aryan O
without O
special O
permission O
; O

and O
as O
a O
German B-LOC
I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
marry O
, O
or O
have O
intimate O
relations O
with O
, O
a O
man O
of O
inferior O
foreign O
nationality O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
frequently O
warned O
that O
I O
had O
been O
seen O
in O
the O
company O
of O
this O
Czech B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
this O
might O
get O
me O
into O
trouble O
. O

It O
did O
not O
come O
to O
a O
formal O
application O
for O
permission O
to O
marry O
, O
but O
once O
I O
made O
a O
general O
enquiry O
as O
to O
my O
chances O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
marry O
an O
Aryan O
. O

The O
official O
in O
charge O
of O
non O
- O
Aryan O
affairs O
in O
Breslau B-LOC
told O
me O
that O
my O
chances O
were O
fairly O
good O
, O
since O
neither O
my O
father O
himself O
nor O
a O
member O
of O
his O
family O
had O
received O
a O
University O
education O
; O

thus O
there O
was O
little O
risk O
of O
my O
transmitting O
Jewish O
intelligence O
to O
my O
children O
. O

On O
that O
occasion O
I O
learnt O
that O
a O
strict O
watch O
was O
kept O
on O
all O
non O
- O
Aryans O
. O

The O
official O
knew O
practically O
everything O
about O
my O
family O
affairs O
, O
work O
, O
friendships O
etc. O
After O
the O
completion O
of O
my O
Year O
of O
Duty O
I O
found O
it O
difficult O
, O
as O
a O
half O
- O
Jewess O
, O
to O
find O
suitable O
employment O
. O

I O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
finish O
a O
course O
in O
shorthand O
- O
typing O
at O
the O
[ O
Städtische O
Handelsschule O
] O
. O

I O
had O
to O
leave O
a O
congenial O
position O
as O
shop O
assistant O
in O
a O
music O
shop O
, O
because O
non O
- O
Aryans O
were O
forbidden O
employment O
which O
would O
bring O
them O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
general O
public O
. O

I O
applied O
for O
a O
job O
in O
a O
factory O
owned O
by O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
my O
father O
's O
. O

At O
first O
he O
did O
not O
dare O
take O
me O
on O
because O
, O
having O
a O
non O
- O
Aryan O
wife O
, O
he O
was O
himself O
in O
a O
delicate O
position O
. O

But O
when O
I O
was O
sent O
to O
him O
a O
little O
later O
through O
the O
official O
employment O
exchange O
, O
he O
engaged O
me O
as O
a O
typist O
. O

I O
had O
no O
difficulties O
with O
my O
fellow O
- O
workers O
in O
the O
office O

In O
August B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
I O
was O
drafted O
into O
a O
labour O
camp O
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
, O
Unternehmen O
Berthold O
, O
about O
20 O
miles O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

We O
numbered O
approximately O
150 O
girls O
, O
for O
the O
greater O
part O
children O
of O
mixed O
marriages O
, O
like O
myself O
( O
though O
there O
were O
also O
some O
Aryan O
and O
a O
few O
Jewesses O
who O
somehow O
had O
escaped O
arrest O
and O
deportation O
before O
them O
) O
. O
divided O
into O
5 O
groups O
. O

Some O
Nordic O
-looking O
girls O
, O
including O
myself O
, O
were O
picked O
out O
to O
be O
group O
leaders O
. O

We O
were O
made O
to O
dig O
fortifications O
, O
but O
supervision O
was O
rather O
lax O
and O
we O
did O
not O
overwork O
ourselves O
. O

Our O
accommodation O
, O
first O
in O
a O
barn O
, O
later O
on O
the O
dance O
floor O
of O
a O
country O
inn O
, O
was O
primitive O
, O
the O
food O
bad O
and O
insufficient O
, O
and O
the O
sanitary O
arrangements O
shocking O
. O

Our O
guards O
, O
uniformed O
members O
of O
the O
Organisation O
Todt O
were O
unpleasant O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
physical O
violence O
. O

Frequent O
beatings O
, O
however O
, O
occurred O
in O
the O
men O
’s O
camp O
near O
- O
by O
, O
as O
we O
learnt O
from O
the O
men O
when O
we O
met O
them O
at O
work O
. O

Our O
daily O
roll O
calls O
were O
perfunctory O
, O
and O
some O
of O
us O
went O
several O
times O
secretly O
to O
Breslau B-LOC
for O
a O
day O
. O

We O
did O
not O
try O
to O
escape O
altogether O
, O
as O
we O
feared O
that O
reprisals O
would O
be O
taken O
against O
those O
left O
behind O
. O

Almost O
from O
the O
beginning O
we O
developed O
a O
strong O
spirit O
of O
solidarity O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
acquired O
for O
the O
first O
time O
a O
positive O
attitude O
towards O
the O
Jewish O
part O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Previously O
I O
had O
felt O
the O
kind O
of O
Jewish O
antisemitism O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
was O
often O
found O
in O
some O
sections O
of O
German B-LOC
Jewry O
. O

This O
feeling O
I O
lost O
completely O
through O
the O
intimate O
contact O
with O
the O
other O
camp O
inmates O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
had O
physically O
and O
mentally O
strong O
Jewish O
characteristics O
. O

Without O
that O
experience O
, O
I O
doubt O
that O
later O
on O
I O
would O
have O
made O
the O
decision O
to O
emigrate O
to O
England B-LOC
and O
live O
with O
my O
father O
. O

Some O
girls O
- O
very O
few O
- O
tried O
to O
curry O
favour O
with O
the O
guards O
and O
slept O
with O
them O
. O

They O
were O
boycotted O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
. O

Their O
behaviour O
was O
considered O
treacherous O
. O

There O
was O
no O
objection O
to O
sexual O
misbehaviour O
, O
as O
such O
including O
Lesbian O
practices O
, O
of O
which O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
outlook O
on O
sexual O
behaviour O
amongst O
my O
contemporaries O
had O
become O
completely O
cynical O
under O
the O
Nazi O
regime O
, O
especially O
during O
the O
war O
. O

When O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
war O
the O
Russian B-ORG
army I-ORG
had O
advanced O
to O
within O
hearing O
distance O
of O
our O
camp O
, O
I O
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
girls O
made O
our O
escape O
. O

This O
was O
not O
difficult O
, O
as O
by O
that O
time O
the O
guards O
were O
already O
demoralised O
and O
hardly O
tried O
to O
maintain O
control O
. O

, O
preferring O

leave O
before O

thrown O
out O

On O
the O
occasion O
of O
her O
leaving O
, O
her O
colleagues O
gave O
her O
a O
present O
. O

This O
was O
accompanied O
by O
a O
list O
of O
the O
subscribers O
to O
the O
present O
, O
with O
their O
signatures O
. O

Several O
Nazi O
party O
members O
were O
amongst O

signatories O

After O
it O
had O
been O
presented O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
was O
visited O
by O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
employees O
and O
asked O
to O
return O
the O
list O
. O

However O
, O
she O
had O
it O
photocopied O
before O
returning O
it O

In O
1940 B-DATE
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
obtained O
employment O
with O
Geb O

Roever O
, O
Aktiengesellschaft O
. O

This O
gentile O
firm O
employed O
many O
Jews O
in O
separate O
and O
inferior O
departments O
to O
the O
gentile O
workers O
. O

They O
also O
received O
smaller O
remuneration O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
, O
as O
Mischling O
, O
was O
, O
at O
first O
, O
allowed O
to O
work O
together O
with O
the O
gentiles O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
an O
SA B-ORG
control O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
, O
who O
has O
presumably O
been O
denounced O
by O
one O
of O
her O
colleagues O
, O
was O
asked O
by O
an O
SA B-ORG
man I-ORG
how O
much O
she O
earned O
. O

An O
unpleasant O
scene O
ensued O
and O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
sewing O
department O
with O
the O
full O
- O
Jews O
, O
where O
she O
earned O
considerably O
less O
. O

When O
the O
regulation O
first O
came O
into O
existence O
, O
according O
to O
which O
Jews O
were O
forced O
to O
wear O
a O
yellow O
star O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
made O
an O
application O
through O
her O
lawyer O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
, O
in O
which O
she O
maintained O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
star O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
re O
- O
marriage O
. O

She O
based O
this O
on O
a O
clause O
in O
the O
regulation O
which O
stated O
that O
Jews O
married O
to O
gentiles O
, O
whose O
children O
had O
a O
Christian O
up O
- O
bringing O
, O
need O
not O
wear O
the O
star O
, O
even O
if O
the O
marriage O
had O
been O
dissolved O
. O

There O
was O
a O
time O
- O
lapse O
of O
three O
months O
while O
her O
applicatiogestagestn O
was O
being O
considered O
. O

Meanwhile O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
did O
not O
wear O
the O
star O
and O
therefore O
did O
not O
suffer O
the O
resulting O
loss O
of O
privilege O
( O
smaller O
rations O
etc O
) O
. O

After O
three O
months O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
was O
summoned O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
H.Q. O
in O
Lindenstrasse O
. O

Here O
, O
after O
a O
two O
hour O
wait O
, O
during O
which O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
accosted O
and O
insulted O
her O
in O
the O
corridor O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
was O
interviewed O
by O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
official O
, O
Schmidt B-PERS
who O
seemed O
to O
have O
more O
humanity O
than O
most O
of O
his O
colleagues O
. O

However O
, O
he O
told O
her O
that O
he O
had O
received O
orders O
from O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Interior I-ORG
that O
she O
had O
, O
in O
future O
, O
to O
wear O
the O
star O
. O

During O
the O
interview O
, O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
Commissar O
entered O
, O
shouted O
at O
her O
and O
told O
her O
she O
would O
be O
sent O
to O
prison O
and O
deported O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
answered O
very O
quietly O
and O
the O
Commissar O
left O
without O
taking O
any O
further O
action O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
at O
another O
table O
in O
the O
same O
room O
, O
another O
Mischling O
was O
being O
interviewed O
. O

Her O
children O
had O
had O
a O
Jewish O
education O
. O

Suddenly O
the O
doors O
were O
flung O
open O
and O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
officer O
yelled O
: O

Any O
more O
for O
prison O
? O

and O
the O
woman O
was O
dragged O
away O
. O

Before O
allowing O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
to O
leave O
, O
Schmidt B-PERS
asked O
her O
to O
send O
her O
father O
to O
his O
office O
, O
as O
he O
, O
too O
, O
now O
had O
to O
wear O
a O
star O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
asked O
whether O
anything O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
, O
and O
Schmidt B-PERS
assured O
her O
that O
he O
would O
be O
sent O
back O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
asked O
whether O
she O
could O
not O
simply O
give O
her O
father O
the O
message O
, O
and O
Schmidt B-PERS
finally O
agreed O
to O
her O
request O

In O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
was O
leaving O
her O
home O
when O
she O
met O
an O
officer O
from O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
entering O
the O
house O
. O

As O
the O
Community O
had O
to O
compile O
the O
lists O
for O
the O
transports O
and O
had O
to O
break O
the O
news O
to O
the O
deportees O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
feared O
the O
worst O
. O

Indeed O
, O
she O
was O
on O
the O
list O
of O
the O
next O
transport O
. O

She O
went O
immediately O
to O
see O
the O
lawyer O
, O
who O
represented O
the O
Jewish O
Community O
and O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
a O
relative O
of O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
. O

The O
lawyer O
suggested O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
escape O
deportation O
was O
to O
divorce O
her O
Jewish O
husband O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
's I-PERS
brother O
there O
upon O
went O
to O
Gestapo B-ORG
H.Q. O
where O
he O
was O
told O
that O
if O
divorce O
proceedings O
had O
been O
started O
by O
that O
same O
afternoon O
, O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
would O
not O
be O
deported O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
was O
spent O
in O
running O
from O
office O
to O
office O
( O
Jews O
were O
, O
of O
course O
, O
not O
allowed O
to O
use O
public O
transport O
) O
until O
a O
document O
was O
obtained O
stating O
officially O
that O
proceedings O
had O
been O
begun O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
then O
took O
this O
to O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
who O
, O
at O
first O
refused O
to O
accept O
it O
and O
asked O
why O
she O
had O
waited O
until O
the O
last O
moment O
to O
begin O
proceedings O
and O
why O
she O
had O
married O
a O
Jew O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
answered O
that O
if O
they O
( O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
) O
had O
any O
humanity O
( O
Menschliches O
Verstaendnis O
) O
at O
all O
, O
they O
would O
understand O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
give O
her O
daughter O
a O
home O
and O
had O
married O
for O
her O
sake O
. O

This O
evidently O
had O
some O
effect O
on O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
officers O
who O
passed O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
's I-PERS
application O
not O
to O
be O
deported O
, O
not O
because O
of O
the O
divorce O
, O
but O
because O
we O
do O
have O
humanity O
. O

The O
next O
morning O
, O
a O
Gestapo B-ORG
man O
came O
to O
collect O
her O
for O
the O
transport O
. O

She O
told O
him O
that O
she O
was O
not O
to O
go O
. O

The O
Gestapo B-ORG
man O
left O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
H.Q. B-ORG
, O
telling O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
that O
if O
he O
did O
not O
return O
by O
12 O
a.m O
. O
, O
she O
would O
not O
be O
taken O
. O

He O
did O
not O
return O
, O
and O
so O
Mrs O
Fraenkel B-PERS
escaped O
almost O
certain O
death O
. O

For O
nothing O
was O
ever O
heard O
again O
from O
anyone O
who O
left O
on O
this O
transport O
. O

Amongst O
other O
of O
her O
acquaintances O
who O
were O
taken O
away O
on O
this O
transport O
was O
an O
Eduard B-PERS
Stern I-PERS
, O
the O
Jewish O
hairdresser O
, O
whose O
job O
it O
had O
been O
to O
cut O
the O
hair O
of O
the O

called O
Aeltestenrat O
( O

the O

was O
Dr. B-PERS
Leo I-PERS
Baeck I-PERS

the O
venerated O

Life O
in O
the O
ghetto O
was O
organised O
by O
the O
different O
departments O
of O
the O
administration O
, O
the O
economic O
department O
– O
food O
distribution O
and O
production O
– O
the O
housing O
department O
( O

and O
the O
health O
department O
. O

The O
economic O
department O
was O
responsible O
for O
the O
distribution O
of O
food O
which O
they O
got O
from O
SS B-ORG
Headquarters O
in O
Prague B-LOC

The O
Jews O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
were O
maintained O
by O
Jewish O
funds O
i.e O
. O
by O
assets O
confiscated O
from O
Czech O
Jews O
. O

The O
economic O
department O
had O
also O
to O
organise O
work O
, O
which O
was O
obligatory O
for O
everyone O
except O
the O
very O
old O
and O
very O
sick O
, O
and O
the O
children O
. O

People O
were O
employed O
in O
the O
timber O
yard O
, O
the O
joinery O
and O
the O
plumbers O
shop O
, O
working O
for O
the O

outside O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
either O
on O
farms O
or O
on O
estates O
confiscated O
by O
the O
German O
authorities O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
work O
was O
very O
popular O
among O
the O
younger O
inmates O
of O
the O
camp O
, O
because O
there O
they O
had O
a O
chance O
of O
getting O
some O
additional O
food O
to O
their O
meagre O
diet O
. O

Repair O

Nearly O
one O
quarter O
of O
the O
available O
space O
of O
the O
ghetto O
was O
reserved O
for O
hospitals O
or O
homes O
for O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
the O
Nazis O
had O
declared O
the O
town O
a O
Central O
Jewish O
Home O
for O
Aged O
People O
( O
Jeudisches O

, O
but O
with O
the O
growing O
transports O
, O
people O
of O
different O
ages O
, O
even O
babies O
, O
arrived O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

In O
the O
barracks O
converted O
to O
hospitals O
there O
were O
real O
bedsteads O
. O

The O
doctors O
, O
many O
of O
them O
from O
Czecho B-LOC
- I-LOC

had O
modern O
medical O
instruments O
at O
their O

Dentists O
, O
chemists O
, O
nurses O
and O
opticians O
were O
also O
on O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
health O
department O
, O
which O
was O
also O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
bath O

house O
too O
, O
attached O
to O
one O
of O
the O
hospitals O

The O
work O
of O
the O
doctors O
and O
their O
staff O
was O
beyond O
praise O
. O

They O
did O
everything O
in O
their O
power O
to O
alleviate O
the O
lot O
of O
their O
patients O

The O
Jewish O
self O
- O
administration O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
medical O
staff O
, O
even O
provided O
a O
diet O

and O
a O
special O
kitchen O

Mortality O
Rate O
. O

Finally O
the O
crematorium O
has O
to O
be O
mentioned O
, O
which O
had O
been O
built O
after O
the O
mortality O
rate O
had O
become O
very O
high O
. O

Before O
1944 B-DATE
, O
at O
the O
time O
when O
the O
place O
was O
inhabited O
by O
up O
to O
68,000 O
, O
about O
130 O
people O
died O
daily O
. O

When O
I O
arrived O
in O
Feb B-DATE
. I-DATE
1944 I-DATE
the O
death O
rate O
was O
about O
30 O
a O
day O
, O
and O
decreased O
later O
to O
10 O
. O

The O
reason O
was O
obvious O
. O

The O
old O
people O
had O
died O
or O
had O
been O
deported O
, O
the O
remaining O
ones O
had O
accustomed O
themselves O
to O
the O
meagre O
diet O
and O
were O
thus O
able O
to O
endure O
the O
hardships O
. O

It O
cannot O
be O
doubted O
that O
under O
- O
nourishment O
had O
been O
the O
chief O
cause O
of O
death O
of O
the O
many O
old O
Jews O
who O
found O
their O
grave O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

At O
the O
time O
when O
the O
settlement O
was O
started O
the O
dead O
were O
buried O
; O

afterwards O
they O
were O
cremated O
and O
the O
urns O
kept O
in O
a O
more O
or O
less O
honoured O
place O
. O

Starvation O
Diet O
. O

The O
diet O
was O
absolutely O
insufficient O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
allocated O
to O
the O
Jewish O
self O
- O
administration O
provisions O
calculated O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
an O
inadequate O
daily O
ration O
. O

But O
even O
so O
, O
the O
self O
- O
administration O
had O
had O
to O
cut O
these O
meagre O
rations O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
priority O
to O
heavy O
workers O
and O
a O
special O
diet O
to O
children O
. O

It O
must O
be O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
food O
allocation O
described O
below O
, O
though O
meagre O
enough O
, O
had O
been O
even O
worse O
before O
1944 B-DATE
. O

At O
that O
time O
many O
new O
inmates O
died O
not O
only O
from O
under O

but O
from O
dysentery O
or O
a O
similar O
disease O

All O
in O

these O

nothing O

I O
could O
think O

nothing O

food O

I O
even O
dreamt O
of O

when O
I O
managed O
to O
fall O
asleep O

I O
was O
hungrier O

Some O
weeks O

tell O

not O

And O
our O
eyes O
ought O
to O
have O
told O
them O
the O
rest O
– O
but O
instead O
they O
thought O
that O
we O
were O
in O
good O
spirits O
and O
full O
of O
hope O
. O

The O
whole O
character O
of O
the O
town O
was O
changed O
by O
this O
embellishment O
by O
order O
. O

Recreation O
grounds O
were O
laid O
out O
with O
large O
flower O
- O
beds O
, O
a O
music O
tent O
where O
the O
town O
band O
gave O
concert O
every O
afternoon O
was O
built O
, O
a O
kindergarten O
with O
cradles O
, O
a O
slide O
and O
a O
see O
- O
saw O
was O
established O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
laundry O
. O

Even O
a O
restaurant O
was O
opened O
where O
one O
could O
eat O
one O
's O
meals O
on O
one O
's O
ration O
card O
. O

The O
benches O
erected O
in O
the O
improvised O
" O
parks O
" O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
blessing O
for O
the O
inmates O
who O
, O
from O
that O
time O
on O
, O
could O
sit O
down O
in O
the O
open O
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
a O
Potemkin O
village O
was O
put O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
foreign O
visitors O
. O

Dr. O
Epstein B-PERS
had O
to O
make O
an O
exaggerated O
report O
about O
the O
favourable O
conditions O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
to O
the O
delegation O
. O

He O
was O
sure O
, O
as O
he O
told O
us O
, O
that O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Commission B-ORG
would O
realise O
the O
bluff O
the O
Nazis O
were O
putting O
up O
, O
but O
apparently O
the O
Commission B-ORG
allowed O
themselves O
to O
be O
deceived O
. O

Reproduction O
Prohibited O
. O

Dr. O
Epstein B-PERS
had O
to O
mention O
the O
high O
birth O
rate O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
while O
in O
fact O
reproduction O
was O
prohibited O
. O

Women O
when O
entering O
the O
camp O
were O
warned O
that O
they O
had O
to O
undergo O
abortion O
during O
the O
first O
four O
months O
of O
their O
pregnancy O
. O

Nevertheless O
there O
were O
about O
150 O
babies O
born O
in O
the O
camp O
, O
black O
babies O
as O
we O
used O
to O
call O
them O
, O
babies O
born O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
prohibition O
. O

Religious O
Services O
. O

Services O
were O
held O
by O
Dr. B-PERS
Baeck I-PERS
and O
other O
Rabbis O
. O

I O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
hardships O
we O
had O
to O
undergo O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
and O
the O
even O
more O
severe O
conditions O
which O
we O
inmates O
had O
experienced O
before O
, O
people O
had O
not O
become O
more O
deeply O
attached O
to O
religion O
than O
they O
had O
generally O
been O
. O

Jewish O
Police O
and O
Jewish O
Court O
. O

Order O
was O
kept O
by O
the O
Community O
Guard O
( O
Gemeindewache O
) O
, O
formerly O
called O
Ghetto O
Wache O
, O
which O
, O
like O
every O
other O
institution O
in O
the O
ghetto O
, O
consisted O
of O
Jews O
. O

There O
was O
also O
a O
Jewish O
Court O
before O
which O
marriages O
could O
be O
registered O
according O
to O
Jewish O
law O
. O

In O
addition O
the O
Court O
acted O
in O
Penal O
cases O
e.g O
. O
thefts O
. O

It O
had O
to O
send O
its O
sentences O
to O
the O
SS B-ORG
for O
confirmation O
. O

Prison O
sentences O
were O
executed O
in O
the O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
prison O
. O

Only O
in O
one O
case O
did O
the O
SS B-ORG
demand O
heavier O
punishment O
than O
the O
Court O
had O
pronounced O
. O

The O
SS B-ORG
. O

Sent O
the O
defendant O
who O
had O
committed O
theft O
of O
provisions O
to O
the O
concentration B-CAMP
camp I-CAMP
in I-CAMP
the I-CAMP
small I-CAMP
fortress I-CAMP
. I-CAMP
Otherwise O
the O
SS B-ORG
. O

did O
not O
interfere O
with O
camp O
life O
, O
at O
least O
according O
to O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
ordinary O
inmate O
. O

We O
did O
not O
see O
any O
SS B-ORG
men O
apart O
from O
the O
Commandant O
who O
occasionally O
rode O
on O
horseback O
through O
the O
ghetto O
streets O
. O

The O
camp O
administration O
, O
however O
, O
had O
to O
work O
under O
the O
daily O
threat O
of O
their O
SS B-ORG
supervisors O
. O

Camp O
Currency O
. O

The O
official O
currency O
of O
the O
ghetto O
was O
the O
so O
- O
called O
Ghetto O
Krone O
, O
a O
specially O
designed O
camp O
currency O
which O
the O
ghetto O
bank O
circulated O
. O

Camp O
workers O
earned O
up O
to O
100 O
Ghetto O
Crowns O
a O
month O
. O

For O
this O
one O
could O
buy O
provisions O
such O
as O
mustard O
, O
carraway O
- O
seeds O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
Oxo O
, O
but O
also O
theatre O
tickets O
and O
coupons O
on O
which O
the O
cafe O
sold O
lemonade O
and O
coffee O
. O

Old O
clothing O
, O
shoes O
and O
travelling O
cases O
left O
by O
the O
deportees O
or O
the O
deceased O
, O
were O
also O
sold O
for O
Ghetto O
Crowns O
provided O
one O
had O
the O
necessary O
points O
, O
which O
were O
issued O
. O

But O
things O
badly O
needed O
, O
such O
as O
additional O
food O
or O
cigarettes O
, O
were O
not O
available O
for O
camp O
money O
. O

For O
treasures O
like O
these O
one O
had O
to O
pay O
in O
Reichsmarks O
or O
Czech O
Crowns O
. O

On O
the O
Black O
Market O
, O
which O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
starvation O
diet O
and O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
tobacco O
, O
had O
developed O
of O
necessity O
as O
in O
every O
prison O
camp O
, O
one O
could O
buy O
a O
loaf O
for O
15 O
Marks O
or O
a O
cigarette O
for O
4.50 O
Marks O
( O
5/- O
) O
. O

These O
cigarettes O
were O
smuggled O
into O
the O
camp O
by O
people O
working O
outside O
the O
ghetto O
walls O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
by O
SS B-ORG
men O
themselves O
, O
who O
made O
tremendous O
profits O
from O
this O
illegal O
traffic O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
SS B-ORG
parties O
raided O
the O
camp O
in O
order O
to O
find O
out O
people O
possessing O
currency O
i.e O
. O
Reichsmarks O
or O
Czech O
Crowns O
, O
gold O
or O
jewellery O
. O

Anybody O
caught O
in O
possession O
of O
State O
currency O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
concentration B-CAMP
camp I-CAMP
in I-CAMP
the I-CAMP
small I-CAMP
fortress I-CAMP
from O
which O
nearly O
every O
week O
transports O
went O
to O
the O
notorious O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
camp I-CAMP
. O

Relations O
between O
the O
inmates O
were O
better O
than O
in O
Westerbork B-CAMP
nor O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

People O
were O
not O
as O
nervous O
as O
they O
were O
in O
the O
more O
notorious O
camps O
. O

In O
a O
concentration O
camp O
everyone O
considers O
his O
neighbour O
an O
enemy O
who O
might O
jeopardise O
one O
's O
own O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
your O
neighbour O
was O
not O
exactly O
your O
friend O
, O
but O
at O
least O
a O
neutral O
person O
. O

I O
have O
only O
noticed O
some O
tension O
and O
state O
of O
irritation O
arising O
in O
the O
relations O
of O
married O
couples O
owing O
to O
the O
separation O
. O

Humanity O
True O
to O
Nazi O
Pattern O
. O

Such O
was O
life O
in O
the O
show O
camp O
the O
Nazis O
had O
deliberately O
organised O
to O
provide O
an O
alibi O
for O
themselves O
. O

Was O
it O
not O
an O
example O
of O
humanity O
to O
set O
up O
a O
kindergarten O
, O
to O
permit O
Jews O
to O
go O
to O
a O
cafe O
or O
to O
listen O
to O
a O
music O
band O
? O

Humane O
indeed O
, O
if O
you O
call O
it O
humane O
to O
deprive O
decent O
, O
innocent O
people O
arbitrarily O
of O
their O
freedom O
, O
to O
strip O
them O
of O
everything O
but O
the O
clothes O
they O
had O
on O
, O
to O
feed O
them O
on O
a O
diet O
which O
enables O
only O
the O
strong O
to O
survive O
, O
to O
isolate O
ordinary O
people O
and O
some O
who O
had O
won O
world O
fame O
, O
completely O
from O
the O
outer O
world O
, O
behind O
guarded O
ghetto O
walls O
, O
sealed O
off O
from O
life O
. O

All O
the O
time O
I O
could O
not O
help O
imagining O
that O
we O
were O
interred O
in O
a O
mass O
grave O
in O
which O
people O
were O
dancing O
. O

People O
danced O
, O
attended O
theatres O
or O
concerts O
in O
order O
to O
escape O
the O
constant O
nightmare O
haunting O
the O
minds O
of O
all O
of O
us O
: O

the O
threat O
of O
further O
deportation O
to O
the O
East O
. O

Parents O
hoping O
to O
survive O
the O
Nazi O
way O
against O
the O
Jews O
together O
with O
their O
children O
were O
separated O
from O
each O
other O
. O

Old O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
who O
had O
been O
reunited O
in O
the O
ghetto O
had O
had O
to O
part O
again O
. O

A O
sister O
who O
was O
only O
64 O
years O
of O
age O
had O
had O
to O
go O
first O
, O
leaving O
her O
brothers O
or O
sisters O
behind O
her O
, O
who O
were O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
be O
in O
their O
seventies O
. O

But O
even O
very O
old O
age O
was O
no O
protection O
against O
the O
fate O
of O
being O
selected O
for O
the O
next O
transport O
, O
for O
the O
train O
, O
destination O
unknown O
. O

Thus O
was O
the O
humanity O
administered O
in O
the O
model O
camp O
true O
to O
Nazi O
character O
. O

There O
was O
of O
course O
a O
difference O
between O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
the O
Eastern O
camps O
. O

In O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
those O
at O
least O
who O
were O
permitted O
to O
stay O
there O

were O
allowed O
to O
die O
slowly O

In O

They O
did O
not O
go O
to O

but O
were O
sent O
to O

to O
build O
barracks O

for O
the O

were O

a O

the O
people O

On O

a O

On O

26th B-DATE

the O
train O
left O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Near O
Dresden B-LOC
the O
SS B-ORG
guards O
asked O
us O
to O
write O
a O
p O
ost O
card O
to O
our O
wives O
. O

We O
were O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
we O
had O
arrived O
at O
our O
destination O
, O
that O
food O
and O
accommodation O
were O
good O
and O
work O
was O
not O
too O
heavy O
. O

We O
were O
to O
invite O
our O
wives O
to O
follow O
us O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

This O
trick O
was O
obvious O
. O

By O
this O
bait O
the O
SS B-ORG
wanted O
to O
entice O
our O
wives O
to O
join O
us O
without O
arousing O
any O
suspicion O
about O
the O
destination O
of O
the O
next O

’s O
transport O
. O

Although O
they O
had O
the O
power O
to O
force O
everybody O
into O
a O
death O
train O
they O
employed O
diabolical O
methods O
like O
these O
to O
deceive O
people O
about O
their O
fate O
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
irritation O
and O
disturbances O
in O
the O
model O
camp O
. O

Perhaps O
another O
commission O
might O
arrive O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
and O
notice O
the O
change O
in O
the O
mental O
atmosphere O
of O
the O

The O

method O
was O
employed O
on O
many O
occasions O
all O
over O
the O
eastern O

After O
a O

It O

but O
though O
we O
could O
not O
see O
the O
name O

we O
guessed O
we O
were O
in O
the O
notorious O
Oswiecim B-CAMP
( I-CAMP
Auschwitz I-CAMP

camp I-CAMP
. O

We O
were O
dragged O
out O

the O
wagons O
by O
prisoners O
and O
not O
allowed O
to O
take O
our O
luggage O
with O
us O

It O
was O
looted O
afterwards O
, O
and O
even O
the O
small O
rations O
we O
had O
were O
stolen O
by O
the O
old O
camp O
inmates O

We O
were O
formed O
into O
files O
and O
had O
to O
pass O
an O
SS B-ORG
officer O
– O
most O
probably O
an O
SS B-ORG
doctor O

He O
sat O
on O
a O
chair O

three O

with O
legs O
outstretched O

almost O

The O
only O
part O
of O
his O
body O
which O
he O
moved O
was O
the O
thumb O
of O
his O
right O

With O
this O
he O
pointed O
either O
to O
the O

stood O
in O

of O
him O

He O
did O
not O
utter O

We O
had O

answer O
three O

What O
age O

After O
this O
sorting O
of O
human O
beings O
1600 O
men O
found O
themselves O
on O
the O
right O
, O
900 O
on O
the O
left O
. O

Not O
everybody O
had O
declared O
himself O
fit O
. O

Was O
this O
not O
after O
all O
a O
working O
detachment O
? O

The O
very O
word O
seemed O
to O
indicate O
that O
there O
were O
different O
kinds O
of O
work O
to O
do O
, O
heavy O
for O
younger O
people O
, O
and O
lighter O
work O
for O
elderly O
men O
. O

Thus O
some O
of O
the O
parded O
men O
may O
have O
explained O
that O
they O
were O
suffering O
from O
complaints O
preventing O
them O
from O
doing O
too O
heavy O
work O
. O

Others O
gave O
themselves O
away O
by O
their O
grey O
hair O
, O
though O
the O
whole O
detachment O
consisted O
of O
men O
of O
military O
age O
. O

This O
latter O
fact O
explains O
why O
so O
few O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
left O
. O

As O
I O
heard O
afterwards O
the O
usual O
percentage O
of O

selected O
for O

was O
85/90 O
% O

While O
queuing O
in O
front O
of O
our O
hangman O
we O
saw O
flames O
arising O
from O
the O
chimneys O

several O

were O
told O
by O
the O
old O
timers O

these O
housed O
the O
central O

of O
the O
camp O

During O
the O
whole O
night O
we O
had O
to O
stand O
in O
a O
stable O

Then O
we O
had O

strip O

give O
up O
everything O

including O
our O
wedding O
rings O

except O
our O

We O
were O
next O
led O
into O

our O
heads O
were O
shaved O

we O

up O

- O
prisoner O
, O
Dr. O
Eduard B-PERS
Zelderust I-PERS
, O
I O
ran O
away O
. O

For O
some O
days O
and O
nights O
we O
remained O
in O
the O
forest O
near O
Blechhammer B-CAMP
where O
we O
heard O
the O
roar O
of O
the O
approaching O
battle O
. O

We O
were O
happy O
. O

There O
were O
machine O
- O
gun O
bullets O
and O
shell O
- O
fire O
, O
but O
we O
did O
not O
feel O
frightened O
. O

Was O
this O
only O
due O
to O
our O
lack O
of O
fighting O
experience O
? O

In O
part O
it O
might O
have O
been O
so O
because O
we O
were O
surprised O
when O
we O
noticed O
that O
all O
civilians O
around O
us O
had O
suddenly O
disappeared O
. O

It O
took O
us O
some O
time O
to O
realise O
that O
these O
people O
had O
simply O
thrown O
themselves O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
in O
order O
to O
take O
cover O
, O
and O
we O
followed O
, O
of O
course O
, O
their O
example O
. O

But O
I O
think O
there O
was O
another O
reason O
for O
our O
standing O
upright O
while O
shells O
and O
bullets O
whistled O
around O
us O
. O

It O
was O
impersonal O
death O
which O
we O
here O
encountered O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
bullets O
and O
shells O
were O
not O
meant O
to O
end O
just O
our O
lives O
. O

Death O
, O
which O
had O
been O
at O
our O
heels O
from O
the O
first O
day O
of O
our O
falling O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Nazis O
, O
death O
in O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
, O
was O
quite O
a O
different O
companion O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
we O
were O
singled O
out O
, O
we O
Jews O
, O
defenseless O
, O
completely O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
merciless O
. O

Death O
was O
lurking O
at O
every O
corner O
ready O
to O
force O
us O
into O
his O
suffocating O
grip O
. O

At O
times O
we O
even O
felt O
a O
desire O
to O
surrender O
to O
this O
greedy O
companion O
to O
escape O
at O
least O
the O
daily O
, O
nay O
hourly O
, O
threat O
that O
he O
might O
strike O
us O
down O
. O

In O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
we O
had O
to O
resist O
the O
temptation O
to O
throw O
ourselves O
against O
the O
seductive O
electric O
wire O
and O
thus O
end O
our O
suspense O
. O

In O
the O
Blechhammer B-CAMP
Forest O
, O
where O
only O
impersonal O
death O
threatened O
, O
we O
shared O
a O
danger O
common O
to O
all O
and O
felt O
free O
and O
relieved O
even O
when O
we O
realised O
that O
the O
shells O
and O
bullets O
might O
end O
our O
escape O
into O
life O
. O

an O
exception O
, O
I O
am O
writing O
you O
in O
German O
. O

For O
this O
letter O
, O
which O
will O
probably O
be O
very O
long O
, O
is O
not O
just O
for O
our O
dear O
friends O
who O
have O
written O
so O
cordially O
to O
us O
– O
that O
is O
, O
for O
Anny O
, O
Josef O
, O
Alfred O
, O
the O
Wintersteins B-PERS
– O
but O
also O
for O
all O
the O
many O
others O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
read O
Czech O
, O
others O
not O
English O
. O

Don’t O
be O
angry O
that O
I O
report O
so O
collectively O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
technically O
, O
but O
also O
emotionally O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
to O
keep O
telling O
these O
terrible O
things O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Before O
I O
report O
about O
us O
, O
I O
want O
to O
narrate O
in O
general O
about O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Because O
that O
is O
where O
we O
left O
most O
of O
our O
common O
friends O
in O
May B-DATE
1944 I-DATE
, O
whom O
we O
unfortunately O
have O
mostly O
not O
seen O
again O
. O

You O
will O
have O
heard O
and O
read O
more O
than O
enough O
about O
concentration O
camps O
. O

You O
probably O
don’t O
know O
much O
about O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
bad O
. O

Especially O
because O
if O
our O
people O
had O
had O
some O
good O
will O
, O
it O
could O
have O
become O
a O
very O
tolerable O
social O
construct O
. O

We O
really O
had O
self O
- O
administration O
, O
it O
was O
absolutely O
not O
a O
concentration O
camp O
. O

But O
as O
it O
was O
, O
it O
became O
a O
morass O
of O
corruption O
and O
arbitratiness O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
very O
clearly O
distinguished O
castes O
: O

1./ O
The O
prominent O
persons O
( O
this O
is O
not O
ridicule O
, O
but O
die O
Prominenten O
was O
the O
official O
designation O
) O
, O
their O
favorites O
, O
and O
their O
hangers O
- O
on O
. O
– O
  O
2./ O
The O
hard O
workers O
, O
including O
doctors O
and O
caregivers O
. O
– O
  O
3./ O
The O
old O
and O
those O
unable O
to O
work O
. O

– O
  O
The O
first O
group O
lived O
in O
luxury O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
was O
protected O
from O
the O
feared O
transports O
to O
unknown O
destinations O
. O
– O
  O
The O
second O
group O
earned O
money O
with O
great O
difficulty O
, O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
acquired O
its O
piece O
of O
bread O
and O
was O
not O
all O
too O
hungry O
, O
if O
never O
entirely O
sated O
. O
– O
  O
The O
third O
group O
starved O
already O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
, O
if O
they O
had O
no O
connections O
to O
Group O
1 O
. O
– O
  O
So O
only O
one O
segment O
had O
it O
really O
bad O
there O
. O

But O
the O
people O
behaved O
as O
if O
everything O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
life O
and O
death O
, O
like O
in O
the O
concentration O
camp O
, O
completely O
ruthlessly O
and O
demoralized O
. O

I O
can O
say O
with O
pride O
that O
our O
mutual O
friends O
were O
among O
the O
very O
few O
left O
to O
the O
old O
, O
Dr. O
Lederer B-PERS
- I-PERS
Beers I-PERS
, O
Dr. O
Erwin B-PERS
Langs I-PERS
, O
Dr. O
Alts B-PERS
, O
Igel O
and O
Rita O
, O
Dr. O
Tschiassnys B-PERS
, O
Dr. O
Reisz B-PERS
. O

None O
of O
these O
ever O
returned O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
about O
Igel O
and O
Rita O
. O

But O
both O
were O
very O
ill O
. O

– O
  O
Most O
of O
these O
friends O
did O
not O
come O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
until O
October B-DATE
44 I-DATE
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
one O
prominent O
person O
after O
the O
other O
was O
called O
in O
and O
shot O
dead O
: O

at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
Dr. B-PERS
Edelstein I-PERS
, O
later O
Zucker B-PERS
, O
Friedmann B-PERS
, O
Epstein B-PERS
/Berlin O
, O
Krämer B-PERS
, O
unfortunately O
also O
Dr. B-PERS
Kahn I-PERS
and O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
had O
long O
suffered O
severe O
depression O
. O

All O
of O
these O
prominent O
persons O
, O
who O
knew O
too O
much O
, O
had O
to O
pay O
so O
dearly O
for O
their O
privileged O
position O
. O

When O
Theresienstadt B-CAMP
was O
then O
liquidated O
, O
the O
rest O
were O
arrested O
as O
all O
- O
too O
- O
eager O
slavedrivers O
for O
the O
Germans O
. O

– O
  O
Of O
our O
closer O
acquaintances O
, O
the O
following O
have O
returned O
: O

my O
brother O
Hans O
( O
Hans O
asks O
whether O
the O
Schäfer B-PERS
- I-PERS
Maierhofers I-PERS
still O
have O
Niky B-PERS
Himmelblau I-PERS

things O

All O
the O
Himmelblaus B-PERS

dead O

, O
Minka B-PERS
Krieger I-PERS
– O
both O
without O
family O
– O
Dr. O
Schild B-PERS
, O
Dr. O
Richavy B-PERS

both O
without O
their O
wives O

the O
two O

Otto B-PERS
Bellak I-PERS

her O
daughter O

recuperating O
from O
severe O
typhus O
fever O

Dr. O
Julek B-PERS
Wechsb I-PERS

And O
Dr. O
Liewer B-PERS
already O
committed O
suicide O
in O
Ostrau B-LOC
, O
Julek O
as O
a O
prisoner O
of O
the O
Gestapo B-ORG
. O

Dear O
Alfred O
, O
it O
is O
great O
good O
fortune O
that O
you O
decided O
so O
quickly O
back O
then O
. O

– O
The O
returned O
doctors O
probably O
have O
good O
prospects O
of O
opening O
private O
practices O
, O
but O
a O
managing O
position O
in O
a O
hospital O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O

I O
am O
very O
curious O
whether O
and O
how O
you O
have O
decided O
. O

Unfortunately O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
hope O
, O
dear O
Anny O
, O
that O
Sidy O
will O
turn O
up O
. O

I O
was O
often O
together O
with O
her O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

She O
looked O
good O
and O
well O
cared O
for O
, O
had O
an O
easy O
, O
profitable O
position O
as O
seamstress O
in O
the O
children O
’s O
home O
, O
and O
lived O
relatively O
very O
well O
. O

I O
don’t O
know O
when O
she O
left O
. O

We O
were O
in O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
from O
Sept B-DATE
. I-DATE
42 I-DATE
to O
May B-DATE
44 I-DATE
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
generally O
depressing O
conditions O
, O
we O
had O
terrible O
private O
misfortune O
: O

we O
came O
immediately O
in O
the O
transports O
to O
Poland B-LOC
. O

Lissi O
came O
down O
with O
a O
severe O
scarlet O
fever O
and O
then O
jaundice O
, O
so O
that O
she O
lay O
for O
3 O
months O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
hungry O
and O
miserable O
. O

This O
misfortune O
was O
our O
good O
fortune O
, O
because O
it O
meant O
we O
escaped O
the O
transports O
. O

But O
my O
father O
, O
Irka O
, O
and O
Lore O
, O
and O
many O
friends O
had O
to O
die O
. O

– O
We O
were O
all O
three O
heavy O
laborers O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
the O
laundry O
, O
Lissi O
as O
a O
nurse O
on O
the O
infections O
ward O
, O
Franzi O
in O
agriculture O
. O

In O
Spring O
43 B-DATE
, O
Erwin O
and O
Lizzi O
came O
to O
Theresienstadt B-GHETTO
. O

Lizzi O
worked O
with O
me O
in O
the O
laundry O
, O
was O
brave O
, O
hardworking O
, O
and O
indescribably O
goodhearted O
. O

At O
Pentecost O
43 B-DATE
a O
terrible O
misfortune O
happened O
. O

Franzi O
, O
who O
had O
had O
an O
unexplained O
fever O
for O
weeks O
– O
probably O
an O
undiagnosed O
scarlet O
fever O
– O
jumped O
one O
night O
from O
the O
2nd O
upper O
storey O
of O
her O
barracks O
and O
lay O
there O
with O
a O
broken O
pelvis O
and O
smashed O
ankles O
. O

She O
had O
no O
reason O
at O
all O
to O
do O
this O
. O

We O
lived O
in O
the O
best O
harmony O
, O
and O
she O
had O
a O
magnificent O
fiance O
, O
whom O
she O
loved O
very O
much O
. O

She O
was O
suspended O
between O
life O
and O
death O
for O
a O
half O
a O
year O
. O

She O
got O
typhoid O
fever O
as O
well O
. O

But O
this O
misfortune O
was O
our O
good O
fortune O
, O
too O
. O

We O
were O
in O
the O
transport O
again O
, O
and O
again O
we O
got O
out O
of O
it O
. O

But O
Lizzi O
, O
Erwin O
, O
Franzi O
's O
boy O
went O
and O
were O
lost O
. O

Franzi O
recovered O
, O
despite O
all O
the O
predictions O
of O
the O
doctors O
, O
and O
is O
more O
beautiful O
and O
in O
better O
condition O
than O
ever O
, O
she O
's O
just O
easily O
fatigued O
. O

So O
we O
didn’t O
come O
to O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
until O
May O
44 O
. O

We O
were O
glad O
to O
go O
, O
because O
we O
looked O
forward O
to O
seeing O
our O
loved O
ones O
, O
and O
of O
course O
we O
didn’t O
know O
that O
it O
was O
Auschwitz B-CAMP
. O

We O
learned O
immediately O
that O
they O
were O
all O
dead O
. O

Franzi O
withstood O
this O
shock O
wonderfully O
, O
Lissi O
less O
so O
. O

I O
had O
to O
be O
brave O
for O
all O
three O
of O
us O
. O

Our O
transport O
was O
the O
first O
that O
was O
mustered O
out O
for O
work O
in O
Germany B-LOC
, O
about O
2 O
months O
after O
our O
arrival O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
was O
rejected O
because O
I O
looked O
terrible O
. O

But O
I O
came O
along O
anyway O
and O
so O
we O
were O
transported O
to O
Christianstadt B-CAMP
, O
Germany B-LOC
's I-LOC
biggest O
munitions O
factory O
. O

This O
was O
a O
subdivision O
of O
the O
concentration O
camp O
Gross B-CAMP
- I-CAMP
Rosen I-CAMP
. O

Until O
the O
Fall O
, O
we O
maintained O
more O
or O
less O
. O

But O
with O
the O
cold O
, O
our O
hunger O
became O
intolerable O
. O

And O
when O
we O
were O
evacuated O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
February B-DATE
45 I-DATE
, O
it O
got O
catastrophic O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
this O
miserable O
hike O
, O
the O
children O
and O
I O
resolved O
we O
would O
rather O
be O
shot O
dead O
trying O
to O
escape O
than O
exhausted O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
. O

We O
were O
not O
shot O
dead O
. O

We O
went O
without O
bread O
, O
without O
papers O
, O
clothed O
in O
shreds O
of O
rags O
right O
through O
Germany B-LOC
on O
the O
border O
between O
Silesia B-LOC
and O
Brandenburg B-LOC
, O
always O
eastward O
toward O
the O
sun O
and O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
artillery O
on O
the O
nearby O
front O
, O
toward O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

/ O
The O
other O
refugees O
had O
turned O
to O
the O
West O
, O
away O
from O
the O
front O
. O

/ O
Farmers O
took O
pity O
on O
us O
and O
let O
us O
spend O
the O
night O
in O
the O
cattle O
stall O
, O
as O
we O
asked O
, O
and O
gave O
us O
food O
, O
which O
we O
never O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
. O

On O
the O
6th O
day O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
German O
front O
fleeing O
from O
Breslau B-LOC
. O

In O
this O
dire O
danger O
, O
when O
a O
single O
call O
would O
cost O
us O
our O
lives O
, O
the O
only O
Catholic O
church O
in O
the O
whole O
area O
was O
the O
first O
building O
that O
opened O
its O
doors O
to O
us O
. O

The O
priest O
, O
whom O
we O
told O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
took O
us O
in O
and O
hid O
us O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
Germans O
quartered O
in O
the O
building O
. O

We O
received O
from O
him O
and O
the O
others O
in O
the O
building O
wonderful O
, O
warm O
quarters O
, O
fantastic O
food O
, O
linens O
, O
clothed O
, O
and O
shoes O
; O

they O
did O
all O
this O
so O
cheerfully O
and O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
even O
though O
they O
themselves O
were O
in O
need O
and O
danger O
. O

This O
change O
from O
darkness O
to O
light O
was O
our O
most O
staggering O
experience O
of O
these O
years O
. O

After O
a O
week O
, O
the O
Russians B-ORG
were O
there O
. O

After O
7 O
weeks O
, O
we O
had O
recovered O
enough O
to O
work O
as O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
as O
linens O
seamstresses O
in O
the O
military O
workshops O
, O
i.e O
. O
, O
we O
traveled O
along O
barely O
behind O
the O
front O
, O
where O
we O
had O
lots O
of O
work O
, O
but O
wonderful O
treatment O
and O
plenty O
of O
food O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
April B-DATE
, O
we O
joined O
a O
column O
of O
people O
returning O
to O
Czechoslovakia B-LOC
and O
arrived O
in O
Ostrau B-LOC
in O
mid- O
June B-DATE
after O
a O
march O
of O
350 O
kilometers O
. O

Franzi O
soon O
moved O
to O
Prague B-LOC
; O

she O
is O
an O
assistant O
to O
Erich B-PERS
Ziffer I-PERS
, O
who O
returned O
from O
Russia B-LOC
. O

They O
lost O
their O
son O
, O
who O
was O
a O
Russian B-ORG
soldier I-ORG
. O

Lissi O
finished O
her O
old O
high O
school O
within O
3 O
months O
, O
took O
her O
final O
examination O
with O
honors O
and O
has O
matriculated O
at O
the O
Technical O
University O
here O
to O
become O
an O
engineer O
. O

She O
already O
knows O
the O
required O
languages O
– O
Spanish O
and O
Russian O
in O
addition O
to O
those O
learned O
at O
the O
school O
. O

Both O
children O
learned O
Russian O
at O
my O
wish O
back O
then O
in O
Prague B-LOC
, O
and O
that O
rescued O
us O
. O

Because O
otherwise O
we O
wouldn’t O
have O
risked O
fleeing O
toward O
the O
Russians B-ORG
. O

– O
So O
we O
have O
been O
in O
Prague B-LOC
for O
14 O
days O
now O
. O

We O
have O
strenuous O
months O
behind O
us O
trying O
to O
replace O
our O
destroyed O
documents O
. O

Our O
name O
is O
now O
Šorková B-PERS
– O
after O
Schorek B-PERS
[ O
an O
old O
nickname O
of O
Josef B-PERS
Schornstein I-PERS
] O
. O

We O
can’t O
think O
about O
emigrating O
now O
, O
this O
is O
not O
allowed O
because O
of O
the O
shortage O
of O
workers O
. O

We O
thank O
you O
all O
, O
especially O
you O
, O
dear O
Rufus O
, O
for O
your O
willingness O
to O
help O
, O
just O
as O
we O
must O
thank O
Samek O
and O
Brüll B-PERS
. O

It O
is O
very O
cold O
, O
and O
if O
you O
can O
help O
us O
with O
stockings O
, O
gloves O
, O
oil O
, O
or O
fat O
, O
that O
would O
mean O
a O
lot O
, O
especially O
cigarettes O
. O

– O
Soci O
and O
Marta O
, O
don’t O
be O
angry O
that O
I'm O
not O
answering O
you O
separately O
. O

We O
have O
conveyed O
your O
wishes O
. O

Dear O
Dr. O
Erich B-PERS
Böhm I-PERS

your O
cottage O

orphaned O

Poor O
Erwin O

us O

you O

we O
parted O

he O
was O
the O

I O

Mila O

I O

a O
healthy O
one O

everything O

If O
I O
only O
hadn’t O
had O
such O
a O
yearning O
